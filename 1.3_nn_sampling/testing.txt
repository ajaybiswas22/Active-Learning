New farm bill free the farmers from middleman
Congress misleading in farmers bill like they did in Rafael and CAA.
For farmers and country to develop first protests have to end...
There are 1000s of positivities with few negativities... So i support Farm Bill 2020 
This is just politics . If punjab is thinking for farmers then they already passed similar bill so much early . They r just fooling their farmers .
Rakesh Tikait has become a tool for Opposition
Being a farmer from Maharashtra we want revaluation of farm policy.we accept Farm bill.
I hope that Yogi and Modi never listen to this idiot- dakait
You mean fake farmers.
They should all go home on the tractors
Our farmers are uneducated..they dont understand this contracts and they cannot deal directly with big companies as they have fear to fooled by big companies..They will also need some middle man to do all these deals..This is why all protest are going on..Why not government set minimum price for each product of grain each year..that will be more understable for farmers
Pm Feku. Illiterate.  Economic is in danger
