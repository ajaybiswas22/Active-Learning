the funniest part of indian democracy is protests of peoples are based on hypothesis . hypothetically humari citizenship chli jaegi , hypothetically humara land cheen liya jaega , hypothetically democracy is going to die in india . there isn't single case where the land of farmer was stolen nor there is single case where caa and nrc took citizenship of any resident of india and yet you see chaos on the roads and stupidity of the peoples . see this is what happens when you alter the history and tell fake narratives and meaning about freedom struggle and freedom , people don't respect it !__label__0
all the time all those protests were for up elections . rakesh dakait is a fraud__label__0
is this a protest or politics ? we ncr people are facing traffic problems every day no one concern__label__0

abe hat kamine just pushing country into another covid wave .__label__0
these farmers are not less than terrorists__label__0
at this point , even the anti modi media has stopped caring about these so called protests__label__0
punjab is a feudal state . being living around the state i have witnessed it myself . the more " gunda " you are the more respect you get . being a gunda is seen as " cool " in punjab . the more vandalism you do , the more cool you are . the mentality of punjabis is like road tere bap ki nhi hm isse block krenge , bus tere bap ki nhi hm isko jalayenge . etc etc__label__0
kik out fake farmers from india ...__label__0
any honest ias officer would have proceed with law and order if the farmers blocking the highway and in turn it might have triggered the traffic jam in the highway .__label__0
these people don't pay taxes and gets every government subsidies that's why they don't care about government property only middle man has to suffer because of this gundas__label__0

ever since sanatan sikh samrat ranjit singh's death , dharma has declined in punjab and this is the result . how ironic that the empire khalistanis want to get back is actually based on hindu values ! because modern day abrahamized sikhism is a creation of the british and isi + radicals from the 1920 tat khalsa singh sabha , not any enlightened guru . bani + brainpower proves this , and the next generation is waking up to the spiritual loss of sikhs .__label__0

farmers must not allow these anti-social elements to enter their area , as farmers ' name is losing respect . true farmers can not leave their land for even a week . they are toiling on the land and making record production of food grains for fellow nationals . those who are on the road to make unrest to the general public are brokers and foreign agents paid for anti-national activities .__label__0
salaa these gundas dont face any action , officers face action for doing duty__label__0

these rich farmers are doing unnecessary protests now and spreading carona . courts have already suspended the law for some time and put experts committe to reform the bill . these rich leaders are just doing politics now .__label__0
they are trying to take advantage of the covid situation . farm laws along with direct benefit transfer has made this is a do or die battle for middle men and these protests should fail . government should not budge . many of the below " farmer supporter " just want to make the government to backtrack so they can use this politically .__label__0
arrest them ... if they want to be arrested .. fulfil their wishes ...__label__0
it is really horrible to see the attitude of the farmers at this point of time , putting hundreds life in danger , what are they going to get out of this ? ? kindly understand please adhere to covid appropriate behaviour . your life is precious for every indian .__label__0

* police should stand down . they are caught in the politician puppetry let the public face the farmer protesters , leaders & politicians who are protesting , disrupting traffic , creating ruckus ... violence etc . let public face the violence , only then will the public take action against these fools and support the police *__label__0
* people have the right to free movement---no one should deliberately disrupt the livelihood and movement of people---the farmer's protest is just that . to create problems---they and their kind should be punished to the maximum so that people do not adopt such actions---can we go infront of their family homes and protest , create ruckus and disrupt their movement for long period of time ? if yes , public should do the same to these so call paid fake leaders *__label__0

ravish should be a man and join the anti modi brigade ... sahi hain yeh aadmi ... kuch bhi ho jaye he needs to be anti modi ... by the pretence ? ? ? go and officially join some opposition party and do some work than just talk and spread falsehoods ...__label__0
this is pure politics nothing to do with kisaan__label__0
wouldn't it be easier to put both the dakait brothers behind bars instead ? so much of time , money and energy would be saved . i hope it rains heavily there .__label__0
shame on ehsaan faramosh sanghi government & their bhakts__label__0
they absolutely have nothing to do other than blocking the roads and to stop country's development they are not farmers they are just unemployed people burning the country just to satisfy there own personal anger .__label__0
do you think these people are educated they get manipulated by the opposition and start protesting and every other state is welcoming these laws except punjab because most of them are unemployed and has a personal grudge towards india__label__0
people you see at 2:34 . do those kids even have a future other than that . people from this community even had a police officer hand cut just because he asked them not to roam in lockdown . they just want the world's attention so they can show they are mistreated and spread more hatred in the country .__label__0
ravish you are really shameless your mindset is beyond repair . be wise do not spoil ndtv__label__0
this in not a kissan andolan , its a political movement to oppose bjp even a kid can understand . shame on these fake people .__label__0
why the docait head has not bee cracked yet ? i am disappointed . the officer who ordered to crack the head should be promoted . these undemocratic bunch of illiterates have taken the country into hostage . if the govt is not ready to listen to them , they should vote the opposition and defeat the present govt . what is this nonsense going on since a year ? the roads are blocked , people are suffering for these few sponsored so called kishans__label__0
don't act like taliban this democracy__label__0
right action . enemies of country . they are not kisaan .__label__0
50 th national shutdown announced that is only enforced in punjab by violent famers . i want them to make this an election issues and ponder at the results , just so they can see that their own children don't suport them__label__0
these farmers protests will be there until the punjab elections . after that , they will shut down .__label__0
modi is a great leader__label__0
these protests have fizzled out . these farmers cant tell what is wrong with the laws except that they want the new laws taken back . these protests are by vested interests and only around delhi by punjabi and up rich landlords . there are no such protests in west , east or south india . jai modi and jai hindustan .__label__0
lol , this is still going . i thought it was over .__label__0
the modi govt n indian army must take strong action against this corona super spreaders asap !__label__0
hahah , , keep on protesting middle men and hoarders , , , you cannot malign the name of farmers , , 10 thousand vs rest , , we will entertain and enjoy your show until you go back home__label__0
the farm laws will benefit the farmers , they can still sell their crops in mandi if they want to , selling it to corporate is just optional__label__0
that is good . these are not kissans but terrorists .__label__0
1 . no masks or social distancing . 2 . how are they still producing crops if they have all been at the rally for so many months ? 3 . all of them are the middle men , who will lose a lot by corporations taking over . have i missed anything out ? do these idiots honestly think the pandemic is over ? they may not be bothered about themselves , but what about the thousands who are going to be infected ? do these idiots really think that everybody believes that they are all farmers and that they haven't been harvesting the crops ? another super-spreader here and then they will blame the govt . for that , and never themselves . imo , the protesters are all idiots and so are the people supporting them .__label__0
reason they lost this battle is because they stared riots with anti hindu slogans , if they stick to farmers slogan all indians would support them__label__0
communist support farmers riots not every farmer in india is doing this drama shame on far-left to use farmer for their agenda__label__0
nobody is asking them to live there ... that is their choice ... this is not a protest for india ... it is only for the benefits of the community of those farmers ... not even a protest for all farmers in india .__label__0
? ? seriously folks , this protest is about as effective as a 2 year child old stomping his feet when he doesn't get what he wants ... if you want to fight the giant corporations and survive , then block their front gates for a week or two and stop production , then when their sales drop they will change pay attention .__label__0
brave heart farmers gonna win did battle , shame on you ppl who r still supporting parasite capitalist government who's fooling andhbhakts in the name of hinduism . in parjivio ka koi deen dharm nhi ha__label__1

dr ambedkar father of indian constitution said on independence day 15 th august 1947 said " now foreigners ( britishers ) are leaving , here onwards indian nazies will rule our india "__label__1
total entire 1300 million people of indians are opposing these agricultural new laws in india__label__1
very sad to our old farmers from punjab and other states dying on the delhi roads . 600 farmers lost their life . these farmers fed india from generations . what is their fault ? only fault is in 1947 , instead of taking their own country they proffered to stay with india as nehru promised them freedom . people now you can see kind of treatment india gave them .__label__1
we are not terrorists , we are framers__label__1
" if you ever sniffed the dust you wouldn't do that to us . " word's of a farmer . it's ok if you can't support them but please respect them , they're farmer's not terrorist.indian media telling lies .__label__1
jai jawan jai kisaan . modi became hitler . doing injustice with his own countries food providers . accept what they are asking for & let them all live a healthy & a safe life . let them go back to their families . waheguru baba ji bless them .__label__1
these farmers risk getting infected by covid to push back against greedy corporate shrills . well done .__label__1
boycott bjp__label__1
bjp first provoked farmers by using muscle power at uttar pradesh ... and now bjp will use these clips to defame farmers movement ... if you have read history well ... then this is the exact technique which british regularly used to defame and curb the nationalist movement__label__1
imagine a country where farmers who feed the country don't have their rights and no one is ready to listen to them and see them in what conditions they are suffering at the borders . government is answerable ... but looks like this country and common people are deamons .__label__1
in villages , we don't have electricity , our schools are closed , children are in streets . future of punjab is finished . political people are so selfish and cruel .__label__1
if the farmers don't want the new bills , why give them ? lol . corrupt shady indian government .__label__1
why did bbc censored the scene where there were lots of red flags flying on the many poles ? trying to prevent the world from seeing the socialist peasants / farmers mass movement against the corporate greed ?__label__1
please speak on shanta kumar report which says procurement of grains should be stopped from punjab , haryana , western up etc and should be done only in eastern states , secondly as per doha round of wto us , canada , eu etc are pushing india to restrict procurement and stocking to service pds i . e . 40 % of population whereas food security act envisages stocks for 70 % of population , thirdly what happened in bihar after private procurement was introduced and public apmc were abolished and what happened to apple growers in himachal after corporate buyers monopolised procurement , lastly pepsi has large contract farming for potato in punjab and issues and difficulties and corruption in procurement where in 10 years price has increased from 5 to 8 per kg but input costs have increased manifold during this time . just giving political twist does not help farmers cause , the public at large cannot be swayed only on political and emotional appeal , the facts and issues and reasoning behind agitation has to be brought forward , if people know details on what is at stakes and what farmer stand to lose by these 3 laws ...__label__1
all govt that is following path of religious ideology is simply a taliban . they can only hit farmers with big wood as lathi . no respect for such govts .__label__1
modi became the prime minister due to lack of education among indians . will modi resign ?__label__1
farmers start stocking all the produce . let the government import food grains .__label__1
remove modi from india because sold all india to coopurates__label__1
no political party will be allowed to campaign until three laws ain't repealed now is the time to beat the shit out of these politicians they need to be deciplined to work for people not for there personal beniefits__label__1
i think that maybe something is wrong with these farm laws because why don't bjp take these laws back despite strong oppose . atleast he should give in bold letters in law that msp is compulsory and will be provided .__label__1
why agitations should not become political ? india against corruption iac was hijacked by a political party and that party should not crib about politicisation . self respect of farmers is injured and politicisation is the tool for social change ... arrogance of the spokesperson is evident , no discussion on the issues , but personal attacks and attack on opposition ...__label__1
thanks u bbc for sharing this valuable information about farmers protest this modi government wants to sell their farming to private companies__label__1
farmers will win__label__1
modi does not care about the sikh farmers punjabi farmers . its the truth__label__1

nothing is gonna happen .. shutdown by farmers will happen only in punjab and some parts of haryana . i think this is theirs maybe 46th nation wide shutdown . , but whole india was opened and working . this tikait guy doesn't have guts to reach even lucknow and conduct atleast uttar pradesh shutdown , his own state .. even his own jaat community people wont even listen to this guy , if he tell to vote against bjp . his father choudhary mahendra singh tikat was a great farmer leader , but this guy don't have any credibility at all .__label__1

gov can just cancel the law and stop this march ... that is the good way of ending this strike .. why modi government is not doing that ? ? ? farmers are protesting for over a five months ... why modi and his government is not knowing that ?__label__1
why did you not see the ' grim ' situation in the election rallies of your masters ? ? virus is only seen in the farmers rightful protest ? only when i go to open my business ? only in my child's classroom ? only when i'm driving in my car ? ? kissan unity cannot be broken .__label__1

why doesn't the government speak to the farmers and close this issue since and for all it will have a negative impact on the economy .__label__1
people who beat up the people who feed them ... why should farmers feed such a population ... absolutely shameful ...__label__1
the stand of sardar gurnam singh chaduni is commendable that is , the whole present political system of our democratic & secular country may be said responsible for harassing the kissans . so that a new party namely all india kissan-mazdoor party should be made by agriculture people for flushing out corporated based politicians by democratic votes .__label__1
if this sdm will deny for the orders he given to the police would have to face music in front of of honorable court . video of sdm is full flaged evidence against sdm .__label__1
bjp aur rss is creating unrest in our country , they should be kicked out from our country__label__1

shame on modi__label__1
* all professions are equally important ... farmers is just like another profession . there is no need to put them on a pedestal . some people quote them as andh datta & that without farmers there will be no food . and as such must support them . what if there were no doctors , nurses , frontliners ; many would hv died during this pandemic what if there were no jawans , police & security personal ; there would be anarchy . what if there were no bankers , money lender ... ; there would financial system will collapse . etc , etc ... bottom line everyone is important including the police *__label__1
orders came from above means feku / thadipar combine . fangs of the most poisonous snake on earth .__label__1
how can a police personal ordered to his team to crack the head of the farmers and due to which one farmer died it was notorious activity done by haryana police with the support of cm haryana and back support of m / s modi & shah . it is shameful for our democratic country .__label__1
next selling assets of nation to ambani and adani will take place . after 25 years people has to stand in queue for ambani and adani to get their services . why this govt is doing this ? no one is understanding the dangers . these are the foundation stones to break the democratic setup . the beating is not a simple lathi it is a big wooden stick , the police man who is beating is nothing but a symbol of power and who given him such a power to beat ?__label__1
present ruling party is worse than taliban__label__1
ht is showing this news as if tikat is a responsible person . heights of irresponsible reporting by ht . shame__label__1

nor bjp and jdu has anything to say that is why they talking rubbish and bad words__label__1
shame on what this channel is bringing to public . all the government has to do is cancel the farming laws and the farmers will leave happily . the government can choose not risk the public health . the farmers have been protesting the laws for the past six months through the harsh weather and the pandemic yet the prime minister of india has not taken a single step in resolving this issue . all because his ego is more important that the livelihood of such a large population . the farmers are fighting for their life one way or another so shame on this channel for said for talking about human health but wasnt concerned when all the rallies were taking place . this is a violation of human rights and the media is corrupt so dont sit behind closed doors and talk about whats the right thing to do because it surely isnt what youre doing .__label__1
