People you see at 2:34. Do those kids even have a future other than that. People from this community even had a police officer hand cut just because he asked them not to roam in lockdown.

Inshallah the far right will learn from this through the economic sacrifice they have caused by marginalising there own citizens!",1
Shame on Modi government. Those farmers from long time protest,1
Modi is a dictator who is anti-peasantry and working only for elite class of his own caste and state...   Time for India to be given back to the people...,1
"Problem with India is there are no Good opposition.
that's why Bjp is in power.
Congress is in complete decline because of Family politics(they should give leadership to mr shashi) 
whereas in Other states like tamil,bengal etc regional parties are popular.",1
Indian media are not showing this thanks international media,1
They want to control food you have to fight to stop them,1
"Jai kisan Jai mazdoor
Corporated govt murdabaad
The fight is to protect food from going into the hands of corporates
As well as farmers right
Both farmers and consumers will have to suffer under these farm laws",1
BJP looks more brutal than the 'current Taliban'.,1
The only people I love in India r farmers.,1
We can't survive without farmers but our leaders never seem to appreciate such a simple fact.,1
"Nothing is gonna happen.. Shutdown by farmers will happen only in punjab and some parts of haryana.
I think this is theirs maybe 46th nation wide shutdown., But whole India was opened and working.
This tikait guy doesn't have guts to reach even lucknow and conduct atleast Uttar pradesh shutdown, his own state..
Even his own jaat community people wont even listen to this guy, if he tell to vote against BJP. 
His father choudhary Mahendra singh tikat was a great farmer leader, but this guy don't have any credibility at all.",1
"As long as Modi is in power, no one can live in peace in India.",1
Indian prime minister PM Modi serving his masters who invested huge amount of money to elect him as pm. Now its payback time. So Primr Minister Modi selling every government sector to ambani and Adani group. Some of the money is going to Israel and France for technigal and military support. Wost prime minister in Indian history.,1

I remember when taleban was cannong those rushing to airport and indianedia was calling them barbaric but then i saw many indian police videos n i am shocked,1
Modi is selling you out and doing whatever the usa says. Probably have a war with China at the direction of the usa. Modi is a puppet leader ordained by Washington.,1

Modi government is a big failure,1
"Modis policy will break India and its states into countries. 
I hope for farmers that they will win.",1
WION plz show this I always see you barking and yelling at others matters. Now cover this. Godi media can't show you reality,1
Farmers definitely win,1
"Meanwhile Indian media is calling them Khalistan terrorists , Pakistan agents, and dubbing the whole thing as foreign media games to hurt Indias image! India is a totally delusional country now.",1
I stand with the farmers! Big Corporate Agra giants are destroying small farms all over the world. This is not just an India problem. It is a global problem. Stay strong! Your voices will be heard! You will have victory!,1
Very disappointing reportage by you on the farmers gathering at Muzzafarnagar. You must have deliberately avoided showing speeches of farmer leaders.,1
The root cause of all this is that ninety percent of  media is sold out & they have become a bunch of lyers.,1
I am supporting farmers,1
1:03 looks like Indian police are more violent than Taliban special forces.,1
"*I Hope Modi government is overthrown the worst Dictator in India history, Look as the Fat motherlover from BJP*",1
I am also a farmer the problem is with MSP only.,1
India is obsessed with taliban and isi rather than working for the farmers... The same farmers stopped export to Pakistan just to be part of modis politics.... Here they are now.,1
This bjp spokesperson Anchor is to junior front of RAKESH tikat ji,1

"Repeal the laws and they will go

"Gov can just cancel the law and stop this March... That is the good way of ending this strike..why Modi government is not doing that ????? 
Farmers are protesting for over a five months... Why Modi and his government is not knowing that ?",1
"Why did you not see the 'grim' situation in the election rallies of your masters??
Virus is only seen in the Farmers rightful protest? Only when i go to open my business? Only in my child's classroom? Only when I'm driving in my car??

"The stand of Sardar Gurnam Singh Chaduni is commendable  that is, the Whole present political system of our Democratic & secular country may be said responsible for harassing the Kissans. 
      So  that a new party namely All India Kissan-Mazdoor Party should be made by Agriculture people for flushing out corporated  based politicians by democratic votes.",1
If this SDM will deny for the orders he given to the police would have to face music in front of of honorable Court. Video of SDM is full flaged evidence against SDM.,1

"*ALL PROFESSIONS ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT.... Farmers is just like another profession. There is no need to put them on a pedestal. Some people quote them as ANDH DATTA & that without farmers there will be no food. and as such must support them. What if there were no doctors, nurses, frontliners; many would hv died during this pandemic What if there were no jawans, police & security personal; there would be anarchy. What if there were no bankers, money lender...; there would financial system will collapse. etc, etc... Bottom line EVERYONE IS IMPORTANT including the police*",1
"ORDERS CAME FROM ABOVE MEANS FEKU / THADIPAR   COMBINE . 
FANGS OF THE MOST POISONOUS SNAKE ON EARTH.    ",1
How can a police personal ordered to his team to Crack the head of the farmers and due to which one farmer died it was notorious activity done by Haryana police with the support of CM haryana and back support of M/s Modi & Shah. It is shameful for our democratic country.,1
"Next Selling assets of nation to Ambani and Adani  will take place . After 25 years People has to stand in queue for Ambani and Adani to get their services.  Why this govt is doing this ? no one is understanding the dangers .  These are the foundation stones to break the democratic setup.  The beating is not a simple lathi  it is a big wooden stick ,  The police man who is beating is nothing but a symbol of power and who given him such a power to beat ?",1
Present ruling party is worse than Taliban,1

Jai Jawn Jai Kisan...... Long live Rakesh Tikat And Farmers unions.,1
Please support for farmers for Indian gourmand,1
"India is the largest democracy in the world, Indian people have democracy and freedom of speech, Indians are the most peaceful lol. Open fire!",1
Nor BJP and JDU has anything to say that is why they talking rubbish and bad words,1
Shame on what this channel is bringing to public. All the government has to do is cancel the farming laws and the farmers will leave happily.  The government can choose not risk the public health. The farmers have been protesting the laws for the past six months through the harsh weather and the pandemic yet the Prime Minister of India has not taken a single step in resolving this issue. All because his ego is more important that the livelihood of such a large population. The farmers are fighting for their life one way or another so shame on this channel for said for talking about human health but wasnt concerned when all the rallies were taking place. This is a violation of human rights and the media is corrupt so dont sit behind closed doors and talk about whats the right thing to do because it surely isnt what youre doing.,1
