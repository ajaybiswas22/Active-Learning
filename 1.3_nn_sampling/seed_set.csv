The farmers have been protesting the laws for the past six months through the harsh weather and the pandemic yet the Prime Minister of India has not taken a single step in resolving this issue. All because his ego is more important that the livelihood of such a large population. The farmers are fighting for their life one way or another so shame on this channel for said for talking about human health but wasnt concerned when all the rallies were taking place. This is a violation of human rights and the media is corrupt so dont sit behind closed doors and talk about whats the right thing to do because it surely isnt what youre doing.,1,9118
