UP elections are near.,1
These police are the sons of farmer. So before firing to farmers they must think where do they belong,1
"By this withdrawal, the middlemen will get greatly benefited to the detriment of small and marginal farmers!  Pity the farmers of Punjab & Haryana!!",0
Shameless zee news ,1
"As usual Vox presenting conjecture to thrive its ideologue. None of the three laws can be ascertained as loss making or detrimental for farmers. There is no guarantee in life, similarly, there is no guarantee that these laws may not be loss makign for farmers. These laws promote free trade by setting up Minimum Support Price (MSP) by removing mediator and giving farmers more power to sell their produce to anybody that they want. Contract farming is an agreement between two parties just like any other agreement where nobody is supposed to break the contract. If farmers feel they dont want to get in to a contract then they may not, nobody is forcing them.",0
Now the farmers bill must be implemented.. This incident proves that government is not wrong. The so called farmers doing it for their own dignity not for all Indians.,0
That's called fear of our Indian army lions,0
We lost near 700 farmers during this protest.... Rest in peace ,1
"Arfa Ma'am  Proud of you, Proud to be an Indian. God bless, Alhumdulillah",1
"1.	Easy and inexpensive transport of farm products from any place to any place has to be provided, without state restrictions. ",0

Then why pannun claims that he is funding for the protest  Rathee either you are lying or you are not informed property or you have been given some agenda  why are spreading lies to instigate farmers against the government what are you up to?,0
This protest is not for just farmer we all must join them,1
Desh ke har insaan ko iss mudde ko sochna samjhna chahiye.......ye koi mazak nhi h it's all about our farmers the spine of country......Corona time me jb Economy Negative 23 per thi tab agriculture ne hi sahara diya tha aur bewakoof Log NITI ayog me baith gaii h kya .....kuch to theek se socho yr,1

"I rate Modi not less than Shivaji Maharaj, Modi is taking diverse linguistic, casteist and regions of divided India of 21st century. At the time of Shivaji, he had all powers to eliminate such opposing mindset, where as Modi is tolerant enough aspersions in democratic India ",0
How many days the farmers are fighting. North atleast keep these in mind. Not only religion,1
Farm laws would have been taken back a year ago  why they delayed this long,1
"Think about the Pakistanis who are no match to India in Space, IT industry, Pharmaceutical Industry, Sports, Female representation, Economy & Film industry,etc.",0
This proved these laws were wrongly drafted and wrongly implemented and forced on to Farmers. It is big win for farmers.,1
Giving your best so as to change the Mindset of 90% Typical Indians.,1
BJP is ruling as a dictator,1
Why were you people rushing you should have let Mr Rakesh Tikait speak more.,1
Please make a video with aerial view stretching from the beginning to the end of each highway farmers have blocked. These aerial views are how we can estimate how many ppl are there in total.,0

"Farmers protest is acceptable as we live in a democractic nation , but in the shadow of this protest some people are raising some anti national voices which is completely wrong .",0
If BJP thinks that they will get benefit in Punjab then it's really a good dream and now his core voters will get away with this attitude,1

Kisan ka income double karna jhooth hai,1
That's gift for afghan government to increase terrorist activities in Pakistan,0
Sadly  they are doing everything for their own benefit not for our farmers,1
"ego of PM is down ,that is the strength of our farmers",1
Aaj bhi anaj store kar sakte hai but limit me. I think if informing the stored anaj is compalsary to government. Then it will not benifit corrupt people's as well farmers also inform government about there production.,0
"There are Reddys village on the borders of Karnataka and Andhra, these Reddys have availed Tractors loans from Nationalised Banks and signed all the legal documents etc to avail the tractor loans.Now they are not repayjng the loans and the bank authorities are not able to recover the loans.The political bossess are solidly behind these Reddys, banks are gearing up to forgo the loans.",1
"Now farmers have negotiating power in Mandis ?.  We have seen farmers throwing on roads when the price of tomato crashed to less than a rupee at Mandis.  They could not even recover transportation cost, where was negotiating power.  Now the mandi cartel decides what rate.  If existing system is so good or just good, why are farmers committing suicide.... Oppose for the sake of opposing or opposing is itself an opportunity to make money...",0
Missy in green need to read the farm laws again. Propogating for modi. Silly lady,1

"People don't wanna change in India to grow, harsh reality, and your decision to take back these laws just open the door for liberals to protest against article 370 and caa. You look weak at the moment.",0
Even the farmers who don't have any formal education understand the DIRTY POLITICS of BJP,1
PM Modi has admitted the lack of his government's efforts to make the farmers understand about the laws and their benefits.,1
"I used to love being Indian but now I no longer call myself this. I am Sikh Punjabi or Khalistani, we want our own country Khalistan.",1
"If we had done this once in India in the 60s with Rice and Wheat, why not this time with other produce and then gradually bring in the farm laws.",0
I think the weakest part of the bill was grievance redressal system. It only allows up to the SDM level and we know the company can influence executive easily rather than Judiciary.,1
Justice for farmers ,1
When you need khalistani votes to stay in the office.,0
"wtf does he mean by punjab farmers? they are farmers from every part of the country, godi media stop stereotyping.",1
Thankyou for you support ,1
No humanity left in Indian police and Government ,1
"Talking about the politics and how it should be played and how the tactics of the NM/AS should have been, instead of what the economic empowerment these reforms going to bring, seems like misdirecting people away from what they are fighting for. Do we have numbers or estimates of how much the economical improvement this farm laws can bring among the farmers and the Indian economy? Could you kindly share them so that people can look at them and decide themselves instead of watching your fiction/drama.",1
Fixing MSP Makes the farmer to grow mono culture farming of grains which is not only bad of balance but also dangerous to environment.,0
Election. Budget . .  hai.,1
Now this seems to me as Gorilla tactics of Afghanistan government forces on Taliban ofcourse with the aid of US Air strikes. Earlier Afghanistan government had to maintain long supply lines and Taliban Chooses to strike wherever it wants and now it is Afghan government's turn to strike wherever it wants and cause damage and loss to Taliban. Gorilla sword is  sharp from either side. It takes efforts to run a government and only a strike to disrupt it. Similar tactics are being played even in politics in India. It takes efforts to run the country smoothly and all it takes is a protest to bring the country to a halt. So anybody who stops the country for petty protests should be penalized for loss of production including taxes and should also be jailed for quite sometime.,0
Do you think these people are educated they get manipulated by the opposition and start protesting and every other state is welcoming these laws except Punjab because most of them are unemployed and has a personal grudge towards India,0
"Now,BJP tattu will say these are khalistani......",1
Many in Protest are supporter of Khalistani Movements they are trying to cash this situation as well.,0
"funny talibans they think they have a chance to win against us airforce,navy,army, ",0
Babu bhaiya election election a gya h,1
I support my farmers.,1
K)  Tax factor must be considered to be imposed in order to maintain that farmers are not only feeders of the society but also tax contributors for development of nation. ,0
"3:40 farmers taxes paid to APMC/ mandi maintains roads that connect to mandis and thus enable transport of the produce. If mandis not maintained , maintenance of these will be affected. Okay. If private competitors come, will they airlift all the produce? Aren't private companies going to arrange easy access to the produce for themselves? they will once they can. Why are these facilities not good already 70 years after independence? That too in India's Bread basket(or whatever we teach in school)? Because nobody has cared till now",1

"Funny....25 to 28 years ago I studied in my social text books about middlemen, MSP and warehouses not being available for farmers. Just around when Dhruv was born.  My friends and relatives are farmers.  And in 2021 the same people who did not do much for the farmers since indpndmce are giving gyan in such videos.  Pappus are very ignorant about what happened in this country since independence, on the ground across states, and who the culprits are. People here hardly know about farming and the challenges across the country.",1

"Just like the Arab Spring, it's the India's revolution to throw away the govt.

It may take just a few days or weeks hence.",1
"Shekhar ji, only a very small percentage of grain produced is sold at MSP, and that too from Punjab and Haryana. If the govt. (FCI) stop buying from P&H, the problem will be solved to a great extent but I am sure it's not as simple as this, so the clutter remains!!!",0

Yes sometime democracy hurdles development. Now you can easily understand how china developed. People says india has Innocent population but this innocence means lack of knowledge.,0
"Holistic organic farming is the key to India's Food Security but at the same time the plutocracies surrounding Indian farmlands and contractual labour and the entrapment done by APMC traders should also be looked into and also state govt. have the power to bypass the farm bills, so the protest don't make sense. I think one should look at the data that comes out from the states that have implemented the new act after some years and then make any judgement regarding the same.",0

"One word summarizes this video: ""Disinformation"". Coming from farmer's family, I know how the mandi (APMC) gangs up and forces us to sell our commodities for throwaway price. I still remember my uncle coming back in tears on how the mandi cheated him. We live closer to another district mandi and we cannot even go to that mandi. We are forced to sell at one mandi only. Yes, the same regulated mandi that you shown in the animation. We are stuck to one mandi only. Don't you think you should have mentioned that piece of information?",0
1. In first bill middle men can also participate in private mandis,0

"the excess food bought by food corporation of india from farmers gets stored and when food corporation of india runs out of spaces to store it just gets dumped . Pvt players will have more resources to manage , store , these products , even export .One of the three laws will educate the farmers about new and modern techniques and different variety of crops  .",0
In my opinion the bigger question that should be asked is why are farmers still poor even after 73 years of Independence . why are they not rich like American or European farmers ? .,0
Law acche the pr ye India h yaha har law ka durupayog hota h aur hota rhega. In laws m kai loopholes the jiska loss gareeb farmers ko uthana pdta isliye farmers protest kr rhe the agr india corruption free hota to ye laws bahot effective hote pr on grounds ka haal sbko pta h.,1

The farmers are not ready to have a peaceful conversation with the government.These laws will indeed improve efficiency of the Indian markets. It is known that the farmers have misinterpreted the laws till some extent.The main cause why the public is angered at the farmers is because when after months of lockdown the city had opened up and was getting functional , the farmer protests though peaceful at first locked up the city till some level again.",0

"The othering of the  ""Hindu boogie""  is constructed along with other  narrative techniques such as labelling ""nationslism"" as 'jingoism', patriotism as 'fascism', self reliance as 'protectionism',  promoting anti-hindu-tva as progressive - egalitarian - liberal standpoint.  This was a ready made ideology carefully constructed & sown in indian minds by British Colonialists that strikes its cords even now. These protests,  including the CAA struggles were the aggressive outbursts tuned to its cacaphonic beats our 'intellectuals' ideologists, & journalists play. ",0
Problem is population. small farmers are small becoz previous generation had 10 sons for 50 acre of land and now they have 2 acres in 3 sons. Farming cant feed so many ppl on a small piece of land. You have to value add in it or to give smone who is more sufficient in it by use of scientific methods of growing crops,0

"all reforms for private will come first' with benifits, continues with exploitation, ends with deaths of the poor, because Indian politics is controlled by corporates.

But I also appreciate Narendra Modi Ji for his various initiatives. India born with protest, no army , weapons , Power stopped the Indian freedom from British. Same way once the massprotest is accepted by common people, then governing  leaders need the strategies to stop.......",1
By heart I am thankful to lallontop channel to standing for farmers  (truth).,1
Non bailable warrant for opposition leaders who are creating this problem in india,0
AAP should lead farmers agitation and bring down this unruly ruling party.,1
"Sir, I understood the point that the government can't procure all the food produce from all the farmers across the country but if govt makes a law by which procurement of agricultural produce below MSP by any private party would not be accepted then the storage issue can be sorted out. By doing it inflation will certainly happen but by this, the lowest strata of the economy will get benefit in terms of money. This will be the biggest tool for poverty alleviation. The ruling government should also consider this point.",0
