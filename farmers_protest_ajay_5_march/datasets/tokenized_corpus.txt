best suggestion by rakesh tikait
congress mudda election uspar modi ne pani fer
tikait chaduni pandher and pannu have instigated farmer youth by their inflammatory statements liquor was also responsible as many people were drunk
so courage of farmers unbreakable bond
logical farmer abhimanyu singh kohar speaks
bhagat singh reflecting in each and every farmer as see their josh and commitment
farmers have really proved how strong unity
i wish indian farmers all luck they can get
ohh elections coming that what matters more modi and bjp
sir i am also supporter of capitalism but india poor country we not developed as europe and yes we need capitalistic approach but we also need government backing so some socialist features must be remain in indian economy
good content missed marginal and landless farmers in raithu bandhu telangana better information flow and storage market facilities may give anticipated results
muslims should be careful and should vote unitedly and with their brains for example constituency where muslims 20 30 or even 40 possibility of muslim candidate getting elected very high but what happens congress fields muslim candidate sp fields muslim candidate bsp fields muslim candidate rld fields muslim candidate mim fields muslim candidate while bjp fields hindu candidate so muslim votes gets divided so bjp wins with hindu candidate in muslim area very easily maybe secular parties deliberately doing this help bjp and weaken muslims politically therefore muslims should focus on one single party only voting for mim owaisi good option for change where where muslims 20 30 or even 40 b quadri india
seems be benificial for farmers but actually not in reality
i think most of these bills in positive direction but they solely cannot survive or decrease farmer apathy
wrong headline what gift farmers made him tow their line

this power of democracy congrats farmers sitting in protest for last one yr bearing rain cold n burning sun exposure n heat
me sorabh i know employee of india today group who always backing up mr modi i am watching for long time always make difficult questions farmers but very polite who spoke against farmers know very well how many laws or bills reapplied by government of india but didnt say anything who were saying no bill or law can be reapplied good but dont listen your bosses just start your channel we with thanks
dear pm thanks for this decision but i will like hear from that all farmers who lost their lives in stire their families will be given rs 1500 pension per month
except punjab haryana and western up nothing protest in india against farm law
messed up west just need admit they lost war against taliban so taliban got more fighters than uk and america common
there few things that could have explained as well like what impact these bills will have in future example of similar thing happened in past why this approach failed in western countries and how bihar doing now since they have implemented these laws in past i am not farmer and not biased either but see long term impact of these bills on them clearly
govt should strengthen apmc government structure for agricultural marketing only way increase farmer income privatization not solution of farmer problems
farmer death
china pakistan congress and ndtv happy
farmers seek getting good price whether apmc or private company we guess always apmc makes 100 profit gov t giving that freedom farmers sell where they get good price than congress law where farmers have sell for less cost tied apmc worker and middle man apmc makes money
in over 20 days more than 22 farmers have died priority should be diffuse situation one solution enact new laws incorporating substantive demands of farmers which government has virtually agreed and also incorporate repeal clause in annulling three existing reform laws new enactment and annulment shall happen at same time meeting demand of farmers and government retaining its seemingly fragile and recalcitrant prestige
question 1 for first law business owner can be private companies as well as existing mandis right if farmer doesnt trust private company dnt they have choice continue their business with mandis another question 2 when farmers get into contract with private company r they not going hire lawyer work out details of contract protect themselves also 3 cant this law modified further add more protections for farmer rather than asking complete repeal
victory of farmers
its why do talibn now because pakistan now no neec more fance between pakistan and afghan border and taliban our own pets

even now farmers can sell their products anywhere
this study for all people fight rights against govtnment live die also but people has strengh fight no brain know what happening so we all drink farmers urine think brilliant and brave
we should all support our pm only one in current situation who can greatness jai hind proud be indian
if incase still wondering why farmers protesting

more than half of states in country dont have apmcs or have already passed bill sell outside of apmcs anyways
these farmers looting other states farmers income
did right thing make video but did not talk about results of these laws in bihar and gujarat essential commodity act not described properly this law could be real price manipulator of commodities unfortunately mention that govt ready give farmers written assurance of msp which not true govt not giving written assurance of msp could have talk about news of mp where traders cheated farmers and mandi tax which talking about usually asked from traders not farmers quality of food also issue so i must say did lot of research in laws but still lot of things missing in video these laws fantastic but for country like australia or canada where farmers have big farm or lot of land not india we have former who do not have even 1 hectares of land per farmers so i do not find too good
we know cant sell your black rice anywhere but fci which cant eat and no one could eat in world would please not break rest of country farmers back for sake of selling your not usable crop government
in up election bjp surely win then bjp creat this i cant belive this creation need some peopile they creat this
mr kejriwal award for delhi listen him and support him by sharing this information as much as all can bring him in mcd now bring change
there few things that could have explained as well like what impact these bills will have in future example of similar thing happened in past why this approach failed in western countries and how bihar doing now since they have implemented these laws in past i am not farmer and not biased either but see long term impact of these bills on them clearly
4 i think we also underestimating intelligence of farmers even they can form cartel in many developing cities many farmers become builders and exploited buyers or another example could be they hoard onions during election season

remember that people power not modi nor amit shah nor bjp
2021 taught me that all farmers wear sikh turban
shameless modi government step down have destroyed india now selling indian companys this ridiculous and we want out
by listening this video we have stand with our farmers
fearing 4th generation warfare this decision good however government should be more strict with people as this farm law was game changer for true kisaan
apmc without msp will be non existent soon passing of bill without division votes already shows attitude of govt all for one thing contract farming once that happens farmers will be pushed increase yield hence more adulterated food in future
i am surprised why middle class and lower middle class people not in protest with farmers because amendment bill straight out crazy
all actually farmers on tractors rally participating
do not blame farmer solve their myriad problems hear farmer out
delhi police throwing stones towards farmers
more than farmers general public gets affected by this laws as prices will be fixed by corporates at will and will surely be outrageous
god bless all seems every government in world has become evil we need farmers praying for all farmers everywhere
no farmer no food
yes definitely these so called true farmers who have lot of money have living out there who can throw away their produced crops which they grow by waiting till months

msp for farm produce then what about msp for educated but unemployed people actually products which get rotten easily cannot be sold at will of producer so concept of msp for farm produce against economics
dear mr rathee what said from 9 55 10 05 in your video about uselessness of farm laws was one of pluses of these farm laws also nowhere nowhere written or even indicated that rights of farmers will not be protected sad that probably votebank politics made govt back farm laws but these laws were damn needed we agrarian economy our agriculture sector only sector that has not seen any progress in past many decades these laws would have brought with them much needed development that india needs compete agri or even non agri economies india lack of prowess in sector one of reasons india opt for rcep coz we would not have been able compete so bash govt all want but do not mislead india no indian economy needed these much recommended farm laws rollback has pushed stagnancy in indian agri sector i guess another few decades

i still believe that small farmers interests should have been above politics
farmers voice matter in this 2021 elections

if modi government does not care about farmers then let all chai walas in this country be removed first then we will see how reacts
what hypocrisy and liar telling only small segment of farmer failed understand their enlighten laws for farmers betterment what sick man still glorifying himself and his sick policies never again
farmer cannot produce as uniform product quality product they going purchase

if government in favour of our farmers that three law not harmful them then should be proved by effecting step and realised farmers that all in their favour or remove law by which everything will be okay otherwise farmers who such will never come back and situation may be very harmful

this farmer leader has courage no politician had uptill now
subramanian swamy disgruntled politician as was not given any ministry as will not listen captain modi no authoritative leader accepts opposing voices from within his party when elections won in his name
this shame because punjab farmers richest and farmers in bihar poorest punjab farmers might loose some money because they will not have dominance over india and all indian farmers will be given equally treatment with this new bill
stop buying wheet and paddy from punjab haryana and insead buy from south india
godi media plz be silence just on watching do not telecast on ur channel or else your channel will be crushed as like farmers so be quite

supporting most radical ethnic groap of pashtons mullah ashraf ghani karzai in past twenty years undirect support of pashton taliban and isis against poor anti taliban ethnics tajiks hazarah that was mistake
panjabis and panjab farmers recognized for their honest relationships they trust people easily but trusting modi costing farmers

wonderful ajith ji see and hear appreciation and recognition of yeoman service have done for journalism and farmers
support farmers kyoki media channels bik chuke will not tell reality
its in farmers hand how and where and when they want see till they dont come into any agreement with private organisation regarding their growing of vegetations they can sell according themselves if they free from any binding its on farmers if they want sell any government bodies or anywhere in net farmers should decide completely in their moves if according new bill they want sell their product in any private organisations its on them they can sell according future rates or according present rates thats should depend on them totally every profits gain should go them government body should be formed which can look after private mandis trade there should be government and 2 parties understanding where should be memtioned about their future activities body should be given complete freedom support and help farmers and protect their gain or interests of anyway should be clear transparency where state and central government should be earning by taxes and other means both in sarkari mandis or private so government have come into 2 job thats providing safety and security and protection of farmers interests of anytype plus 2ndly gain taxes in mandis requires few clarification and changes in law and farmers can improve their vegetation and produce more keeping workers and labourers under them
if farm laws repealed will be extremely alarming precedent will mean that vested interests who have ample of resources will have ability block reforms by democratically elected majority government
we love punjabians and support them eat ever they belongs india pak anywheres
doubling of farmers income old jumla nobody believes
respect farmers they backbone of our country
one question why farmers go punjab from bihar and up work as assistant for getting msp which provides their family needs
now godi do not have any options rather supporting bjp if they leaves godi india anyways never accept them
thing farmers from punjab won that and do not ever bark about development and compare india china cause here seamless democracy sweet poison for india we have seen in nrc caa cab we have seen in farmers law so we gonna stay like that forever
its only due transaction fee cess on sale of crops that roads get built in rural punjab by mandi board without this state governments have no other source of income build rural roads
reality farmers know their betterment more than any politician because they work in field not in air conditioning room
there any correlation between your commentary and videos should video after incident and not mowning down of farmers this shows clearly which side media taking
only brave men in indian media rest r impotant
someone in bjp even mentioned 14 percent cannot do anything what will 2 percent will do that what wrong and inciting punjabi farmers and compared shaheen bag well thats result now history will remember this
economics padhiye please farmers operating in perfect competition they price takers they need huge investment for thier growth
finaly farmers won jai hind
like here in states smaller farmers will not survive and big farming corporations will buy their land at cheap prices
punjabi sikh farmer only 2 of total farmers we can talk when at least 50 farmers protesting
these farm laws have three bills
if same police would have immerse latti charged or would have open fire or used air bullet then thies farmer would have played victim card shame on u khalistanis

i request and urge all readers and subscription members download pdf of all 3 farm bill and read by yourself
thanks bro for raising farmers voice always raise events than need be raised
major point that youve missed out in your video fact that bihar has already abolished apmc mandis bihar farmers have suffered so badly that theyve had move punjab and haryana as labours on farms private players in bihar buy 1 kg of cabbage for rs1 so clearly these laws have been applied and not beneficial for farmers so i guess they arent protesting for heck of also same model has been applied in america and france please do read about how free market has ruined lives of farmers clearly your research not in place and your points baseless
but these farmers have
i very happy that u visited site instead of some farzi peoples who were making negative comments abut our farmer brothers and u
for telling truth about farmer thank from heart with your right knowledge country becoming young strong future of india getting brighter
modi visionary reforms what was said before and after by bjp and godi media
good presentation i think missed some part such as taxation part in mandi govt have also imposed taxation in apmc but outside tax free this strategy will push traders deal outside apmc mandi n this also 1 reason for farmer protest also that they feel they will get dominance from private player so they need msp as legal act in india protect their survival thirdly process of proceeding against such contract place also point of disagreement by farmers these points have missed out
3 essential commodities amendment act 2020 1 remove commodities like cereals pulses oilseeds onion potatoes from list of ecs 2 liberalising regulatory env remove fears of private investors from excess regulation 3 drive up investment in supply chain eg investment in cold storage 35 40 wastage due lack of storage facilities and cost around 35000 cr farmers 4 in case of emergencies like war famine natural calamity these commodities can be regulated again safeguarding int of consumers
shame on delhi and haryana police working under bjp

well done modi punjab sure shot come in bjps ambit with captain amarinder
other farmers who support these laws should try support these laws by counter protests
we do not want see modi and faces farmers asking p
howsoever intelligent abhijit mitra may profess comparing fall of vajpayee govt which incidentally happened due great mr subramanian swami coaching jayalalitha and nuclear deal where opposition was purely political farm laws shows fallacious nature of his overall thinking being recent convert bhakti due poor following of his earlier superintelligent rant against modi this absurd analogy understandable
how dare they beat our farmers like that what happening in north india that why tamil peoples hate bjp we support our farmers
this opportunity gov luking for now godi media will defame thm
farmers lifeline of world salute farmers and bbc lifeline of truth
not about actually helping farmers but all about making themselves feel better

agriculture sector me farmers rights chin udar privatization chate agricultural economy khatam use deformed karana chahte corporates chahe paisa fek bill pass hie tahat zamin chini jayengi aur jayengi isika part contract farming
msp should be made compulsory even in private contract if pvt companies want have products directly from farmer they can bid higher than msp
now modi ji took step back by this but i hope know when modi took one step back then what will next
farmers win
big but poor this mentality of protesting farmers shows wisdom of mass protest in india
nobody looking issue everyone trying turn into politics no body interested in asking farmers their reason of crying
well seeing sentiment of people turning more against farmers in comment section more evident that govt itself have instigated this violence or have sent their people do these violence or bhakts and gang doing their job sincerely
industry asked about policies wants but agriculture policy decided without consulting farmers or agricultural scientist
govt has lost confidence of india that why has repealed three draconian agriculture bill defeat of democracy against authoritarian rule jai jawan jai kissan jai bharat
key point this guy missed fpo farmer producer organization which needs be concurrently into this context
700 farmers have lost their life during this wrong decision of govt which now u turn who responsible for this rs50 lakhs compensation govt job one family member and memorial at singhu border required be constructed with all these saheed
not victory of farmers but defeat of non farmers now non farmers will face consequences

bro in my opinion government parties always plays dirty politics they can do anything for power but politics on our national flag police forces not acceptable i do not know how they farmers came inside red fort but that not easy go inside in red fort so i think very dirty politics has been played and for farmers protest doing by them only acceptable when was in peaceful manner violence not accepted and on national flag never that not easy influence anybody i know that violence will be done one day but i did not expected in this way and about who did mistake i think was mistake from both side no one innocent farmers as well as all parties guilty behind this and who defending them farmers and all parties i do not expected that also i am worried about my future and our future as i am only 16 years old i cannot live in this kind of environment which going more and more destructive day day and i am not worried about nation world nature i am worried only about thinking of people around all our world if i say something wrong please forgive me
these bill only support big corporate
i think farm laws way empower farmers laws may not be perfect as of now but at least their initiative presence of government agents middlemen has dwindled ability of farmers grow from labor businessman some may be exploited but that will thrive them grow people in india want have same lifestyle and income as rich developed countries like canada but they do not want work for they want be handed by government for no extra effort or cost people need grow out their mindset best form of governance self governance
indian media world ranking 142 congratulations jute chato politicians
only police have rights use violence and batons against farmers its free country and so farmers they can use sticks too
shame this godimedia channels how can this chatugiri increase day by day
we care about all section of indian regardless thier religious cast if farmers do not want any reforms in thier life let them enjoy ordinary old systems let rich aadatia continiuesly exploit them but do not blame modi modi unfortunately major huge section of farmers deprived from these reforms farmers could have sit together with govt can ask necessary amendment suggestions in these reforms or any other bills instead trying bow down modi image i believe this farmers big loss of indian farmers let hope one day they will find correct solution

modernity tech have no say over farmers nature based soil based environmental farming should be adopted
thanks zee news for exposing congress promises
so what i mean say essentially educate farmers on such issues and this comes under state list
i thought tells about benifits of farm laws but telling about bjp
tikat never going be happy what has done for farmers with his black money or helped farmers nothing mixed with anti elements so nothing can happen
waiting for these so called protestors protest against punjab govt as well pr contract farming me kisaan ko jail praavdhaan but wha inko grants aa maalik khilaaf bolenge
tikait has got political ambitions other side so called kisans also crossing limits how control them could they be be allowed do anything under garb of some andolan
there concerted effort by godi media and goi agencies not show depths and seriousness of this protest so ordinary citizens across india has not understood gravity of situation for farmers hand that feeds billions in india including rich and common
farmer leader point about msp cent percent right
if u do not consider problem solution law do seem be problem i even started doubt my belief and understanding about these bill after watching your video i do hope your video help farmer protest because sure does not help farmers
again and again khalistani elements using veil of farmers protest
do understand impact msp buyout by government has on environment farmers sticking easy crop and wrong methods of farming irrespective of demand since they confident that government will have buy their unsold produce at msp
for farmers their leaders who dpondored by opposition bharath only covering few areas of states where all 26 pieceneal opposition parties have some support still statewise agitation fizzled out so now show that entire nation agitated by giving some photos of pre planned gatherings destroying govt property like what they did in delhi
i farmer i appreciate farmers hard working and feed country but i disagree with anyone blocking roads
thank sir for genuine reporting kisan ekta zindabad love from uk
i really appreciate this we have support our farmers just because of them we getting food each and every day good job dil foodie team
onion thing really squeezed farmers in nashik one day they were getting good money for onions for once and next day crash bottom lows
1 scientific knowledge should be provided in laymen way farmers make their crops water restoration soil and fertilizers usage better
modi govt cares about farmer interest just as much as godimedia care about journalism
from farmer so there chances that in future these companies will
whatever decision our most respected pm modiji takes in india interest acceptable all citizens of india ling live modiji
atlast modi also cannot save indian farmers more farmers will be affected without reforms
if bjp was alleged of muslim polarisation even when in opposition will left journalists hv audacity say its sikh polarisation by congress n or u still blame bjp n say its fair in politics
mulching will increase incomes by reducing costs for fertilizers and water and increasing yields mulched soil healthier and holds water better farmers could share mulching machine and can go from farm farm share cost there needs be more people that care about environment in india there climate crisis we must stop polluting environment maybe government should subsidize mulching machines for farm groups
no amount of peaceful protest will get justice from traitors culprits bandits anti nationals these true anti nationals killing farmer
clause wise bills protect msp apmc mandi storage funding farming with kisan unions political publicity mongers opportunists fake social workers ngo sevaks brokers in bahrupiya disguise be segregated and punished severely
i am modi supporter but this time
if u eat food thanks farmer dont bite hand that feeds u
yes right i am also from farming most of our farmers do not know facilities rights what msp and all first government must provide good platform know them and information should be easily accessible and rest goes well
offcourse msp kanoon not that simple be by ruling government will minimum not less then minimum two years come conclusion so feel mr rakesh ticket will block highway for another two year really disgusting who will give support near by villagers foe their livelihood of kidans on aandollan pay their expences they wellcome otherwise through them out of premises only solution wake up india jai hind
rakesh tikat true picture of 21st century farmer
even farmers can join and form cooporatives
lastly i no bjp supporter i from bengal and aware people would know well what means for bjp and support base
but more 90 of farmers have nothing do with these laws its media that has hyped them and agitation against them we in west south taking advantage of many newly introduced facilities for farmers booking rail wagons send farm produce far away places using digitally connected markets get better rates than local mandis or selling directly online retailers like jiomart bigbasket etc more and more farmers taking organic and zero budget farming these laws do not matter either way
ajit ji truly great journalist who has been selected for such reward by public more than prejudiced bharatratna let see godi media
india democratic country bill pass
minorities right big problem in india muslims sikhs have live according law that what secular country do but i do not think so bjp gov good with that i not looking any future of bjp in coming time modi last tenure bring india verge of lost their land
strange that only farmers who owns audi bmw range rover and from punjab only opposing this bill
farmers yes
i am surprised even after so much following your facts and figures not making any difference and this party winning who voting why people cant understand this so question rises just godi media making all difference or their real different thought process in population who follow bjp ideals i am educated and yet i am confused
was not controversial they were very good laws now these uneducated farmers will bring indian economy down ffs
farmer anger understood but same farmers were trying pretend that they were efficient producers
stringent action should be against miscreants artis and agents they not hard working farmers
rich farmers of 2 3 states won game worst part even congress and many farmers opposed even though these laws were first proposed by congress by support of farmers at that time
well explained sir i am farmer son and i really appreciate speak for farmers
about contract farming set up quite similar futures market in finance fixing price in contract before farming solution avoid counterparty risk in these farming contracts could be set up exchange may not be feasible immediately but can be pondered on for long term benefits in order increase transparency in future
thanks for video just one quesiton people opposing this bills if farmer wont get msp from private company why cant go back and sell in apmg mandi as usual where gets msp these newly added laws but not replacing any current laws
sir i never had exposure or dream become ips because i grew up in environment where we only discussed punjab and khalistan but today at age 45 i feel my life has totally been transformed and i owe lot i feel not only educated but confident in most current affairs love from canada
govt wanted stop suicidals and poor living conditions of farmers govt will not stop any subsidies or procurement through fci nor ration system and all 138 crore people cannot depend on ambanis mall for buying rice and foodgrains do think ambani adani have malls in all over india
bill was past in parilment farm laws have repeal should be done in parilment not merely announcing
paid khalistanis which supporter of congress party and leftist
era of modi humiliation every where within india against neighbours even with so called friendly governments like americs iran and afghanistan
these farmers need move on more sustainable business model right now they living on charity through indirect subsidies like msp and free electricity indian farmers not capable of living without charity
police must join with farmers your brothers
this man should be baared from using any product by farmers then will realise who farmer
yr log apny farmers py tear gas phenck rahy
modi ji uour govt showing weakness and antinational movement by tikat doing way want disturb contry environment
this great victory for our farmers against government feels like we have won against dictatorship
shameless modi india has never had such shameless pm in history ruining india
many farmers in my village unhappy with repeal but i think they deserve not deserve these laws
whether government has into account livelihood dependants on agriculture other than farmers while stick passing bill i doubt farmers will be benefitted whatsoever rather attitude shown in floor of rajyasabha seems beneficiaries some else in long run entire agriculture will be monopolized by business tycoons as seen in europe america canada n so on
im against this law as exploits farmers contract farming something farmers feared as give open permission udyogpatis exploit farmers and removing msp will bring our farmers below poverty line which could be disastrous and can lead famines and depletion of economic liberalism and turning indian economy into capitalist economy whic can be pretty fatal for our country jai kisan kisan ekta zindabad
godi media learn lesson how earn respect like ajit anjum ndtv navin kumar reporting
election aate bjp sudhar
may god protect our farmers so many old people
but i do not want him be minister not even mla deliberately not understood farm bills and used farmers polish his politics
do not worry owasi ji when right time comes we will ban taliban also and other terrorist organisations as well
phir 12 dec mega congress rally join
1 all india agri organisation be formed formulate policies for farming collection of yields stocking of yields and distributing consumers
sarey farmers will be crorepati and no more suicides lol
all decisions should be made by farmers rs should listen farmers not ruling party
tata investing in bigbasket so they can make farmers rich selling their produce products abroad
about certain community of one particular state protest state that exports agriculture fruit and here exaggerating as whole indian farmers against law his own race not safe in stop being popularity money minded work lil bit for your local first
i strongly support modi but if bjp bring this bill than believe me bjp forget about center they cannot even getting any provincial govt first time rahul saying right i know even does not know anything about this matter
thank for speaking about farmers protest really appreciated
max price by private company price in apmc price in apmc
did tell how farmers were affected by apmc act very nice sabhko
seems consumers ones who would be affected more than farmers besides some sort of safety being provided farmers which brings them positive side
if any trader give price higher than msp in mandi then will be minimum price right
lets see if godi media will hold debates on this or not or even air this video on their channel
does pakistani regret supporting taliban now will afghanistan annex waziristan
4 they think they weaker in negotiation positions if that case then why cannot they do collective selling so that many farmers will negotiate and sell then they will have higher hand they themselves will come for selling in any areas
since agriculture state subject states should have been into confidence centre has encroached state jurisdiction though at present msp being continued there scope for end which endangers farmers interests though objective of bills said be elimination of middlemen namaste indeed small middlemen would be replaced with huge corporate houses which means centralization scope form syndicate and dictate terms meanwhile large number of so called middlemen render jobless and thrown into poverty i e amassing wealth by few individuals repealing essential service commodities act or removing food grains great harm public gives traders huge scope create artificial scarcity and hoard fleecing public money i sighting horrible future and terrible exploitation
farmers clearly well informed look at discussion police does not know thing
wow thrilled see this kind of coverage of tractor parade thanks harp farmer pictures why dont modi media showing this
unfortunately debt will have be paid by small farmers which would have got most advantage from three farm laws
sir iam fan of your lectures but i do not agree with minimum support price which was given by indian government basically farming sector most hard one comparing any other sector but amount they get from very less or camparitavily loss due this situation many farmers do suicides because of loss iam not against indian government but when ever we private people in any sector they will think about profit so here government should strictly give guidances for prices in same way we should reduce paddy growing cost by encouraging machines in agriculture sector by giving subsidy for farmers i am agreeing government giving subsidy but not reaching poor farmers were distributed among rich landlord farmers by using their political influence in my point government should encourage reduce cultivation capital and give proper guidance for minimum support price properly in ground level because people has no option that why your not buying my paddy as government markets because we have right question government but here private people mainly concentrate on profit government should proper measures overcome
do not know how on name of farmers peoples working as protest more than 50 percent in protest they broker which farmers money and for that government has passed law by which all broker will lose their money and all money will go too farmers pocket
farmer turns violent rab anchor te rabb same situation paye
thanks bjp all indian united against these evil devil
his sorry for his supporters n surely not for khalistanis who have been defending iconic farm laws all these years ngl i was shocked myself but guts accept that party somewhere failed their supporters deserves appreciation dont wanna sugar coat anything but lets wait n watch
lets have another agriculture revolution for our farmers kisaan ekta zindabaad
this why modi in power will next election too
1 farmers produce trade and commerce act
if value of tomatoes increased in market then farmers has gain their money according contact right
we support bjp
just sit back hold on for some more months and do not vote for existing government instead choose one independent candidate who represents farmers govt got massive vote share in last up elections that why they so egoistic
stand with farmers
never hurt farmers their need comes
its tragedy for small farmer
this mainly give profit private companies or government but minimize profit of farmer
however could not do anything by staying in congress therefore left congress and decided go with modi shah sad also promised support any move in national interest but was against farm laws for reasons best known them
stand out of herd behaviour and try understand laws logically that only aims eliminate middlemen who takes away 40 t0 60pc farmers price wealth
production cost increase five time if modi ji asked farmers income increased five times
feeling very proud for my farmers
this where our india leading shame on indian govt how mercelessly indian army dealing with indian farmers
was all planned from day one canadian khalistanis funded these people and used farmers protests protest itself was pointless why protest against something that your own farmers in majority asked for did farmers no ask for private firms buy their produce so they can get most of money instead of government
prepration of up and punjab election
in case these bills were for betterment of farners then there should have been improvements in apmc and law on msp instead adani agro ltd have developed 1000 of acres cold storages and silos in past 3 years wherein there was no mention if these bills
this bill could be progressive medium for development of farmers but if we focused loop holes and do some amendments we could work even better do not just look as political agenda government should unite farmers opposing just because of political support not good something practically difficult apply but alterations could help improve
whole nation with farmers for do not implement 3 new rules
respect for farmers but this not way deal with government we respect babu bcoz of non violence protest this unacceptable
11 one specific political party which never even supported our armed formed with good weapons high on supporting rowdy farmers our iaf were still flying 40 year old planes when 15 year old scooters scrapped
i not against or for laws but i think must make video explaining in detail complete law as i can see that had done pick and choose of only parts which look negative i sure there must be protection given farmers which no body explaining initially series was well explained about green revolution but as came down laws seems be biased
not bjp supporter at all but i feel this reform good
stand with farmers yes we thanks for your ground reporting maam
one day citizens n farmers of india can understand ur point of view we r with u modi sir

only reason repeal upcoming election
4 entire india knows that khalistani elements have entered protest
laws good look outside punjab and will realize how much private participation required for other farmers who do not get government support on price
i have been bjp supporter for long time never have i been this dissapointed farm law was revolutionary in many aspects now every opposition party will think they have won
india need mixed economic policy not all private or public what problem set msp reason loot farmers your old video on this subject very informative not this one

shocking terrible crime against india farmers indian citizens shame on up government
3 farmers that went redfort were wrong
dear omniscient sir when u supported bill u could have foretold same then
omg pardon me for voting bjp in last elections on behest of badal
this datta samant moment for indian farmers if they do not stop at right time they should just look at what happened with famous textile mills of mumbai cannot have msp that declared by govt on all agricultural produce markets will fall and then traders will resort cheaper imports consumers will also adjust farmers that will have no where go i fear for farmers hope better sense prevails and protests at least called off now
marginal farmers usurped by rich super rich farmers nri
no one begrudges anyone including farmers become rich and wear boss or calvin klein on marching protests but these rich goons bullies who have held govt at ransom and actively suppressing poor farmer in bihar up odisha etc who barely has torn baniyaan or gunjee wear and who mostly ends as wage laborer for these rich goons in punjab etc
great now can please also do video on how rich countries like and canada exploit loopholes at wto and do not allow not so rich countries developing economies support their farmers directly through central government funding
for 1 2 percent of farmers sacrifice 99 percent farmers of india
wish good health and victory for our farmer protest
well government must ensure corruption free farmers system and looking at current agriculture situation all three laws indeed necessary bring revolution in farming and make farmers well connected business world so that they can increase their income but all i can see these so called farmers agitation in reality political moves or we can say its anti modi agitation nothing else
indians stands with farmers modi bill only for corporates
i do not know what right or its getting quite difficult understand about this bill right r wrong but in india every day 40 of food wasted without even using hungers rate increasing day by day so i do not think so what ever rules we had till not much use full
now farm laws being repealed i do not see any political party or polititian would even touch no matter how good or bad laws will be
scrap three black farm laws jai kisan support farmer
kudos those who still supporting bjp
5 khalistan flags in farmers protest
apmc in punjab haryana one of best in world due this u can see difference in farmers of punjab and bihar where apmc was abolished and mercy of private players

agree whether elections or national security govt cannot repeal laws which passed in assembly what about farmers in rest of country only middlemen of punjab and haryana were really protesting for their vested interests this will only lead emboldening of opposition separatist now opposition knows how make lame duck of modi govt start more protests now they can organize more protests bring back article 360 repeal caa etc
defeat bjp and nda in coming state elections will be forced central govt for reducing petrol diesel gas prices only option reduce high price defeat of bjp teach bjp lesson defeat in coming election they will be forced reduce petrolium price
if farmer stick fell asking for forgiveness because there five states elections this has started showing some drama again look through speech and gestures clearly visible

debate discussion sounds good for farmers indeed should have happened ideally but history tells that will not good anywhere even what good for farmers atleast not with this opposition
madam ji there no laws in place safeguard farmer private companies will use every tactic get maximum profits if they get control of farming sector this from government point
whats lost lost and uk natos or imf etc should now salvage some hope by supporting moderate taliban leaders control extreme factions send in humanitarian assistance asap give money so they can pay for starving citizens we must do everything we can prevent civil war
apmc fullform agricultural produce marketing committee sir not agriculture price sir but its ok happens
for those who says farmers getting paid for what they harvest then military also got paid bro
where meenakshi lekhi who called farmers mavali
sir plz read this what if bjp do not win in majority in next election what predictions in that case
atrocities on physically handicapped in india be by punjab govt
those who condemn these attacks on farmers must share and like so that should be shared by youtube and get justice from system justice should be done and culprit however powerful and rich they must be punished and brought justice
farmers who celebrate this applauding their own decline punjab used be richest state now middle of pack all youth going canada etc they think they good because biharis up labourers come and work but one day even these states will overtake read hare and tortoise story punjab got headstart with green revolution but became complacent just want work fields missed out on manufacturing
father of andbhakts bowed down i sure that now andbhakts will call modi g khalistani and will never vote for him
bjp will get zero in up assembly election congress will come back
rules were imposed by modi govt farmers have no acceptance of these despotic rules
farming in india needs reform but listen me they need lots of amendment by people who involved in farming that necessarily dont means farmers only but people in university mastering agriculture and peoples in authority who will implement laws correctly
farmers bill not wrong but there some loopholes which govt have fix
can t describe how much i respect all farmers
these bills were supposed be for happiness and well being of farmers if they not happy who hell modi trying appease end this bullshit let india show its democracy let farmers vote on
huhuhh my parents literally only watch pro bjp news so i had pretty pro bjp mind tho i always wondered there such huge protests wen media claims that there nothing worry about
thanks all farmers
sir do think that any trader will be able give maximum rate of his crop farmer if not will there be any law on
phir this time up and punjab election result pataa lag
2nd now left people joined put their agenda infront just in name of support farmers
good move if rest of farmers which majority and in need of same should stop remaining silent and start speaking
i agree with farmers
should be made applicable all such cases where parents have died intestate without preparing any will from year 2015 onwards this amendment must be immediately brought in this monsoon session by bjp if they at all care for old age citizens
people living in big cities can not feel how farmers suffering
though bills have been explained nicely many of clauses which meant benefit only corporates have been conveniently left out intentionally or unintentionally for which farmers protesting few among many listed below
how come every indian i know or speak too hates modi
i fully support these laws remove apmcs and msp opposition mps rioted in parliament shame on them
print supported by special interest and working for them long term plan get rid of most farmers and let big private corporation run farms just like in western countries then farmers have work for them on minimum wages rest of them have go cities and live in small flats and pay rent and depend on government for their living this drama has already happened in western countries and now happening in india
already taliban hs captured many places in afghanistan now there will be trouble for india we must be very strong at this moment and at every moment
only middleman mediators unhappy with this bill as they r scared of competition its good for farmers as they can sell anyone who ready pay them higher price
sikhs do not need any certificate from anyone anywhere in world they just do great wherever they go they love their country of birth and respect all countries they live in they central pillars of india and pakistan
seems protesting farmers clueless and do not have authority decide power decide lies else where
we need bhakt banerjee on farmer law issue
united we stand divided we fall full support my farmer brother from hindu
bjp needs be in power execute other reforms cannot deny fact that could not convince protesting farmers and probably there ways bring in changes with in realm of current agricultural laws
this bill actually good adn will help farmers lot only these madivalas angry because they wont get money from exploiting farmers
its defeat of real farmers today again politics wins over development again in india i think now real farmers should educate themselves and ask question their leaders
all this laws have been imposed for future planning punjab border state in india which has land access countries like pakistan arabs and russia in future there will be no petrol or diesel and will be replaced by electric transports short cut routes will be essential for transport so adani and ambani wants own punjab over trade in future these laws finish land owners in punjab and when there no landlords then adani and ambani can control trade in future punjab pathway for agriculture business in future worth billions of dollars first weaken farmers and then over their land then adani and ambani owns punjab punjab being looted for more then 40 yrs now drugs have been deliberately and purposely supplied into punjab weaken their youth bollywood given role into supplying deadly stimulant people nowadays have trust on bollywood gods this fight should be for all bhartis not only farmers because these suckers coming up steal everything from some countries looking forward for these change for their benefit do not think all should wake up now how much poor want be these riches ones not originally bhartis they lineage of italian israels etc fight now or never may god destroy blood suckers this statement has been simplified for ease understanding for everyone please watch i goat pet ii video as well
respect for indian farmers
farmers too much depends on government that problem give them freedom sell their products according their wish
punjab farmer lobby different

farmers should demand nationalization all adani owned food items storage facilities
taliban welcome if settlement business treaty between india taliban

as son of chinese farmer have my support farmers should be respected we not social liability but greatest producer producer
well done farmers all right on your way
being from family of small farmers we have no hope now
so if only 5 of farmers use apmc in first place why farmers protesting fact that markets outside of apmc will stop getting taxed
only 6 farmers able buy at msp rates
matter serious and media too should help public of india understand timeline of this crucial protest with point wise explanation of kisan act 2020 and point wise demand and changes requested by farmers of india esp north west pros and cons of farm bill 2020 and pros and cons of demand of farmers protesting since 9 months
still disgusting see large chunk of indian diaspora abroad they want equal rights abroad but side with fascist regime of modi back home
election aa gye h isliye kanun vapas h brna kisan shaheed jate but chor chaukidar kanun return nhi leta
govt wanted bring farmers out of poverty agents of poverty convinced farmers that they will be exterminated from this country
just imagine tomar or goyal telling modiji about their lack of conviction like sushmaji could vajpayeeji other times other leaders
well done karan paaji going and doing this great job we with and our ann data our country farmers
i do think laws should be repealed government handling situation and also seems be passing off bill hastily without much conversation or thought here has been major issue and has been my constant complaint about current government having said that i do feel bias on any side still bias and me showing one side of story regardless of whether i agree or not and not including other opinions on subject and putting narrative from different view so as not tackle issue still biased this will just help all of enforce our biases even more and make people write hateful comments based on which side they fall not sure how people can make informed opinions based on this video
when indians allowed modi barricade kashmir they did not know that they had given him license do so also within india
priyanka and rg not politicians both siblings will serve themselves their party and country better if they recover preserve their legacy for future their legacy will be better served if they let congress become alternative right now with them at helm not heading that way for lot of right thinking people am not talking about politicians who have left them recently but educated people who concerned that inspite of our aspirations our majority government india not progressing health education sanitation road and airports easy
farmer laws back
farmer law should leave on decision of state government
govt should suggestions of farmers before making any law

farm laws were not bad but problem was that government does not various farm union say for this that why they were demanding repeal all laws as if they were having fear of uncertainty than only one law was doing that but brutal things happened farmers were very very bad so according me repealing of 3 laws was good for all farmers and may be seen as result of various by polls

decision repeal farm laws really very bad and gonna cost loss of credibility of this government but there something that does not add up because every common person knows that bjp not even in race in punjab so how can pm do not know this i do not believe this
in future this bill not only affect farmers but middle class and lower class people also then only private companies will have power decide prize

if apmcs and msps here stay and new bill providing additional option im failing still understand what problem what am i missing farmers can continue seek in apmcs whats challenge

so farmer and daily wages people anti national wow
i feel that this farm bill proposed by gov needs some changes amendments imply that our most diligent hardworking farmer brothers get their truly deserving rewards
most of farmers in india fairly uneducated and live in poverty problem with bills that while promotes free market and opens new possibilities options for farmers will encourage more and more corporates enter in agri trade contract farming will be encouraged by these companies who have lawyers who will exploit loopholes in system and put clauses and conditions in contract minimise wages of farmers do think farmer will make rounds of courts when does not deliver on contract due bad weather similarly stock hoarding will be problem in future as companies will play role in controlling prices and demand just as in stock market do not forget that only thing that matters for corporates profits
modiji best im farmer enthusiast with mbbs ms general surgery degree and i support farmers bill ndtv worst news channel ever

what role think social media has played in farmers protest
please support farmers and india wake up now bjp for india cancer
very informative video msp concerns of farmers from maharashtra and haryana genuine i liked most explanation however theoretically concerns looks smaller but in reality practically as child of farmer and background of families back in india and understanding their perspective they also have valid concerns and fear from this acts resolve this government should come forward and speak face face with farmers who protesting and try neutralise their concerns by adding insurance and assurance government currently almost blunt and rude about that further creating fear and uncertainties baat masle solve hote very good content excellent presentation and thorough command over thought abstraction and very engaging video
but there possibility that due many private player farmers can negotiate on better price we cannot speculate future or live in fear of jio and amazon never had monopoly in india they always had competitors like flipkart and airtel and this competition helped consumers with lower price telecom prices
forces opposing peaceful farmers knows this those who did these wickedly act on peaceful indian farmers will soon loose confidence be ruler of this indian nation
on field reports say up has already swung bjp already know if this monetization pipeline nonsense does not work 24 gone as well modi and shah will not be going back gujrat on their two feet if they angering public like this

nobody likes sit on road in freezing cold unless its matter of life or death which actually for farmers and country needs understand that corporatization of food supply with monopoly of big players going hurt every individual in long run because wheat cannot be grown in kitchen gardens
so sad india world largest democratic country so farmers have rights protest against central government
what do think people forget 1 000 farmer die for what do think indian people forget okay no chance any bjp over there no no no no no no go home please stand with farmers
mr sanket upadhyay when farmers were protesting were not there now going there playing safe journalist more in this country than real ones play safe like some others also
for me today best teachers day farmers teaching fight against injustice by govt as well diluted poison of communal energy spread by idiots in 2013 hats off my real teachers my heroes
this some real damage our nation we should be seriously concerned about because eventually will destroy our economy and gdp but we should not be concerned about little damages done by politicians that 3 lakh children die every year 850 daily of hunger in india 19 crore sleep empty stomach daily damage damage but illiterate mindset can only be fooled in believing one thing completely while forgetting major events rip those who died killed in llakhimpur
laws themselves have always been great in their spirit usher in great era for independence in farming economy first thing that angered farmers was suddenness and swiftness with which laws were enacted without prior engagement and sensitization of farmers what was coming up nobody implements such far reaching laws with such brashness like what pheku did instead of mitigating that anger pheku dominated media and govt machinery went into assault mode which further exacerbated problem by compelling farmers postures which just getting worser and worser was all phekus ego right from start that wouldnt listen and was other side that had listen all his apologies and soft tone now purely facade and election gimmick why else would pm who was trumpeting development hardly 1 day ago even using iaf for his election by landing in c 130 on his expressway also apologize because was clear that nobody bought that empty progress nautanki this sadly only way make narcissist pheku listen when election time
welcome decision let pm should support farmers live with respect
these people just want embarrass india they dont want peace international community sees this there farmers all over india but only this group has problem with farm bill but up international community doesnt care
mr modi has roll back decision in favour of farmers
we support farmers

i am bihari we support kisan bihari farmer cry on 10 kg of maize and buying 80 rupees diesel mean 1litre diesel 10 kg maize in farming 1 acre of land requied 85 litre of diesel
thid government have crossed limit of barbarity against farmers

this protest organically done by people of india against puppet government which rules india
this good for country farmers of two and half states hold government ransom and government had give in free electricity free water in fact turning india into desert free right pollute and in fact kill so many in north india due breathing problems plus government guaranteed price for rice and wheat that india does not need but government forced buy rice and wheat and that lies waste in fci godowns wonderful i suppose wonder why farmers outside punjab haryana and western up did not join protests these bills were good for country and economists supported and was passed by elected representatives what precedence does this set

3 small farmer cannot afford come and sit for protest for so long otherwise his family would go hungry hence either they were paid handsomely or they were not farmers
dosh aur 700 deaths naam chuki takes elections make things happen in india
34 of india economy dependent on farm sector government want hand over 34 of indian economy over big corporates those who in favour in bills just do some research on bihar agriculture economy agri culture our of undivided punjab region culture those who shouts all day on television about their culture being in danger without no reason trying destroy our culture hence we protesting
even farmers seems bunch of hooligans may have forced police this extent
1 now small farmers have option sell right at their own doorsteps and not worry about logistics middlemen and commission taxes bribes all these leads produce wastage and loss of important time cashflow etc alternatively they free sell through mandis
do they know anything about farm reform laws they not acting like leader of farmers but brokers or pawn of other interest groups
btw believe that all work of bjp even though not sure how come believe that these all farmers i mean act shown in this video completely threat humanity but still what real farmers doing here protesting instead of doing work in farms i mean farmers pre occupied by lot of work
bjp now some farmers leaders make them interviews i dont think so farmer either
because those farmers have guts
sorry for those farmers who r celebrating till date none proposed better law for betterment of farmers these real farmers thinking i see only politics
tamilnadu farmers also started protest against law all citizens with farmers jai kisan

just one question why farmers not agree on point point discussion with government
very sad watch indian democracy and system falling and being modified by some powerful and vulture of democracy rip those innocent farmers and deep console their families
4 farmers will not be able sell their products others

i am happy that all farmer problems resolved and no farmer will commit suicide
let go farmers worldwide we have fight as one
see how conveniently have side stepped money power of punjab aditya brokers and their hold on punjab farming communities farm brokers as powerful as zamindar army combination of pakistan time smash this and only modi capable of doing
anna hazare called started struggle against corruption during congress rule also in anshan for this purpose
shame on delhi police who attacking farmers
when bjp govt saying ordinance will help farmers sell their product all over india
nl team i am always impressed by your research ground coverage however this time might have skipped due diligence being jat from western up mr tikait not something jat farmers lookup just check his background and input from local jats farmers credit mr t for handling media
can plz add that bill offers them more choice if they have apprehensions about contract farming they can sell in mandis so where problem
i am farmer most of my villagers support modi
taliban nothing infront of indian army
first punch by taliban india
i am from pakistan and i think these new laws will not effect farmers but if intentions of government was make this just for sake of rich corporates then these corporates will definitely squeeze farmers and their familly
only farmers
this might go down in history as your stalingrad mr modi bill for which and your entire party were vigorously campaigning for past 1 year u withdrew and backstabbed all people who believed in gayee apki 56 inch chhati aise desh chalte tikait dakait ko national leader banane aapko badhai
justice for farmers
just insert in same law that msp mandatory and if anyone tries buy from farmer below msp they will be subjected contempts mentioned in law this clearly mentioned in fsa act also
will be suicidal for any country have military presence in afghanistan afghans ruthless warriors from times of durrani and much early even british captured only india and pakistan not afghanistan soviets failed in afghanistan led nato failed india no way near comparing this two super powers in terms of military capabilities and india not that stupid send its military on afghan mission
why not any protests around whole country especially in other agricultural states why only punjab and haryana
congratulations farmers great victory of farmers
no farmers no food
there gst tax in india now where rebate checks for low or no income people when 3rd world countries start tax people who live below poverty says all i decide i wont be voting in federal elections anymore in canada
after watching this video i am wondering why farmers protesting for all three bills instead of buyers general public who according this video will bear high costs but then could also be true these protesters actual big players of mandi who does not want loose their own monopoly
there several protections for smaller farmers prevent land grabbing and corporatization again msp aspect protects farmers from any contract price set by big players through contracts or mandi sales this very progressive bill and surely sets out benefit farmers who can look outwards benefit and expand their operations provided some clauses put in place prevent abuse case in point benefit kashmiri apple farmers from msp and purchase of apples by nafed
bjp has realized that without farmer support they cannot win up elsewhere have moved rss mediate pacify them seeking their votes
10k farmers die due existing system failure provide good returns farmers for their crops which was not created by modi govt
i watched twice but could not get why farmers really protesting dhruv became anti modi instead of being social media journalist by confessuing irrelevant flaws in modi decisions rather than explaining truth
sikh farmer mafia of panjab biggest threat poor farmers
can explain if police did pre emptive strike on protestors with tear gas and water cannons when exactly destruction of venue happened shown at 1 30 if was before did farmers move back checkpoints reported clash only there and if was after what kind of use of force was that despite which they were able destroy property here and there
useless things happening just taint bjp govt but all these lies will not work sabki lagegi time aane especially tikait
modiji should urgently remove his current political advisors and bjp cell save their governments in indian states
no need give msp large farmers we not in state where we have food scarcity not 1960 anymore
this one man spoil whole adlone and unfortunately govt and paid goddi media have not given any news about those two sikh youth who lost lives one with firing of police and with tractor that because of police man with talwar should answer that who told show this act of foolishness and ruined all hardships of lakhs of people in biting cold and sleeping on floor and even some lost their lives now as mr rajowal requested again and again farmers do not bring any weapon they do not need and made up your mind that sit for peaceful andolan
farmers have full rights protest but always encourage them peaceful and patience at all times world watching closely through many channels i remember word bharat mahaan bhimisal desh
congress vote bank does not care what they did they just want see congress in power but in case of bjp they do not get that kind of support we can see what kind of words being spoken in case of mr modi hindus wants everything instantly no patience at all
sir thank this very informative and what propose in end great solution but unfortunately that has not been provided by government yet instead of taking away existing msp and mandi system why cant govt first create market for alternative crops and incentivize farmers move towards other crops and then phase out these supports on wheat and rice seems unfair ask them give up their existing livelihood in hope of something better there no doubt that farming sector needs reforms but would be better ensure that farmers not left worse off than their current situation
brother from bihar was spot on bihar has no mundi system and they run punjab for work despite having farms in bihar
i am very happy with this new situation as most genuine farmers i know in coastal
6 32 that expert himself said msp used by 6 of farmers in short failure

after one year of struggle and losing 700 farmers
ps central ground water board in 2019 said that punjab and haryana would be desert in 15 20 years if do not change farming practices
think if happened in bengal what will be reaction of godi media and honest sir reaction who label bengal as destabilize governance
sir in apmc and mandi there bidding process and price discovery mechanism if discovered price low farmers can sell at msp how will price discovered in direct trade with company will companies purchase at above msp because they always try maximize their profits by reducing costs so they always try purchase at lower rates
yogiji best pm
no matter what our vote atal modi bjp we have too many jaichans in our country our 70 yrs of corruption very difficult get rid of we h so late of putting our party in power then we expect few honest men get out we made one mistake of not electing bose patel lets not make same mistake with most honest leadership of modi ji
msp not minimum selling price minimum support price matlab amount suugestion sirf gov buy krti crop private players es km rate buy krte region me gov acquisition km msp 1800 crop 1000 bikto
people from maharashtra still not aware that this implemented in maharashtra since 2016 no news channels shown this news at that time and that why there no protest against bill in maharashtra
russia china pakistan officially taliban ko support
if speak in hindi all farmers will also understand
those who funded agitation have been helplessly pressed grinding halt tikait like men go jobless opposition leaders murmuring as what politicise for future lakhs of commuters as well as residents of blockade site who suffered lot thanking government farmers gain or not but bjp after election some state assemblies over fresh laws may be enacted with support of punjab and haryana farmers also
this could have all been prevented if government was sensible enough actively communicate with farmers and allayed their fears this democracy cannot just suppress voice of very public who give power
why not talk with before indian government with farmers
and apparently poore desh kisan sirf punjab haryana and west up
sir i want ask simple question before this bill private companies were not allowed procure crops directly from farmers
fan fact only 14 farmer sale there product at msp more than 80 farmer never know there msp also
in future farmers should be educated about pros and cons of bill and conciliation and confidence of farmers must be considered which part of good governance avoid post legislative resentment
not big private players already engaging in private contracts with same small scale farmers whom so boldly assume will get exploited by crony capitalists in dairy and poultry products how many cases of amul exploiting its dairy farmers have heard of
respect towards farmers
beep mar ankit das congress neta from kanpur naam ndtv ban congressi media
shekhar i disagree with at 4 00 as well imagine private mandi opening where trader will pay zero taxes buy crop and apmc where trader pays 8 in taxes where will trader go private mandi if trader saving 8 on tax they will give 1 2 in offer price for crop attract more farmers as result more farmers will go private mandi because they will be offered higher prices as compared apmc so who will use apmc neither trader nor farmer i ask think about what will happen if this trend continues for 2 5 years what will happen apmcs which already managed terribly
doctors should not risk their life treating this farmer protestors
surely good journalism requires point out what likely happen after deregulation in 1996 farm bill was introduced with promises of farmers being able sell abroad and thereby increase commodity demand however in 1998 42 000 farmers with less turnover of less than 250 000 dollars disappeared because prices fell in 1998 small family farms disappeared and large corporations with deeper pockets thrived by streamlining distribution and driving prices down this great new for consumer i hear shout yes maybe in first instance but later when these corporations whose primary aim profit start buying farms which they no doubt will do india will go way of ie prices and supply being dictated by corporations who create virtual monopolies and offshore tax structures that benefit their shareholders and deprive indians of proper tax revenues and choices yes current system requires changing but do not be fooled by promises of exports and globalisation global markets very often more volatile that local markets surely better way find middle ground deregulate outdated systems but at same time enshrine in law some method of protecting its own people from corporate greed source exported death economic policy institute 1999
farmers not stupid give them tools and income they can produce miracles
sir our anndata kishan protesting for their rights in bill but our respectable prime minister modi justified kishan bill today in man baat our pm giving his man baat andhbhakt but not listening man baat of india farmers man baat should listen farmers
answer will say how harmful farmers
drama after symbolic agitation of bks modi govt will agree on framers issue and will be circulated that because of rss and which will minimise electral damage of bjp in upcoming up election
being farmer our products choked within district mandi inspector exploit further only adatiyas benefited this set back for small farmers
this reminder bjp government not people of india as fools apologize and compensate families that have lost their loved ones during whole year of protests remember lathi charge water cannons police brutality can not work today in democracy had been warned almost year ago but advice did not get into your arogant head
bjp projected win 4 out of 5 elections before this reversal and even layman knows that has zero base in punjab and scrapping of these laws will not have any effect on their prospects either may be captain may gain some ground and even bjp aligns with him they will hardly get very few seats which no big deal reverse these laws and damage its reputation does pm not know damage this reversal would cause his reputation inspite of has this stand means there could be some more compelling reasons of hour have some patience and avoid knee jerk reactions and reasons
thanks modiji just earned by vote
clueless poor farmers will remain poor forever
for those who do not know these farmer laws does not even allow farmer go court in case of dispute so luck dealing with profit driven companies
every farmer can grow fruits and vegetables in punjab but there no systems and there huge exploitation as we know there huge diffrence between buying and selling prices of fruits and veggies obviously we all aware of food inflation in country in short there should be msp and mrp of every commodity if we want save nation
very fact pm assured that msp will continue and bills for farmers welfare reason enough oppose we have dozens of examples what happens when promise achche din
worst government common people will suffer greatly under bjp rule in future who supporting this government now

good comments by rakesh tikait
whether brought in over night or not not important whether they in favour of farmers or not important
does not want talk real farmers fake govnmt
one word summarizes this video disinformation coming from farmer family i know how mandi apmc gangs up and forces sell our commodities for throwaway price i still remember my uncle coming back in tears on how mandi cheated him we live closer another district mandi and we cannot even go that mandi we forced sell at one mandi only yes same regulated mandi that shown in animation we stuck one mandi only do not think should have mentioned that piece of information
most of these farmers educated enough and be fair if uneducated tea seller can understand bills do well why not farmer who actually lives through any farm legislation
america wants dominance in every continent days have gone now new india modi leading world now hindu nationalist leader
this bill in favour of farmers these people distracting them

foolish decision by bjp if they had withdraw d farmer rule they should have have done frm begninng why they spoiled d image of india so much allowed guspethhis n aantakwad god only can save india
contract protestor tikaith will conduct protest anywhere in india using name of farmers by taking contract
sir govt ne farm law wapis that good current law farmer khush
huge blunder by modi ji i was of opinion that some radical step necessary change trajectory of poor agri sector i though lacked understanding of laws i trusted this bjp govt that there some logic but this act of modiji just shows that himself lacked conviction bab bad move by this govt
need debate between feku and someshit patra on benefits of declared repealed farm laws will be quite watch
did not expected this from modi govt personally speaking i found these laws beneficiary for young farmers by this u turn govt actually made very weak image in front those who wants suppress real development of atma nirbhar bharat

4 moreover covid 19 crisis rather than being shock for farming community made evident that as compared salaried class farmers where in much better position while those working in cities faced lay offs lockdowns and subsequent financial uncertaininty leading long walks by labourers from dehli bihar farming community had face none of those
really sounds good that they giving our farmers option but will not allow corporations devise some way out exploit our farmers
good give options farmers but upto farmers decide do not failed miserably with demonetization gst and inflation that citizens and farmers cannot trust when deal with roti and food
bjp working sell lease auction and handover public infrastructure private and corporate supply chain like sarkari schools dark laws will destroy farming as has done education healthcare and employment dedicated poor
help of crpf and notorious elements should be identified and caught rather than all farmers being suppressed which will lead more resentment
brave farmers
beautifull great work farmers
protest no use naxalite future of india support country naxalite and its government naxalite always with alleviate poverty and ensure equal human rights
thank modi ji we welcome your decision
contract farming for farmers where they will be told by corporates grow what kind of crops as in product agreement sponsor company will provide farm services including seeds terms and conditions of farming agreement can also be exploited by sponsors companies based on time of supply quality grade standards and price exploiting loopholes in fci standards
news deni log kud ko locals rehe patharbazi tents torh forh i mean they attacked farmers es singh ne that was in defense do not forget ladies aur bachchan
when krishna avoided fighting with jarasanth and leave mathura and create place called dearika god and by sudarsan chakra can easily killed him instead as if was running from mathura like that modiji may have plan and for that punjab election may be vital now may face criticism and we may come know reason later i am sure god full control and his plan will be done and who knows what in store for world
those farmers must be wearing 10 000 rupees imported shirt and pants
great analysis i would also add that whole blame corporates idea should be rejected unequivocally in india this 20th century communist view that was defeated and proven be counterproductive all over world
under congress rule kanimozhi was sent prison for allegations of corruption in 2g spectrum scam atleast congress took action on their ministers however here bjp minister son has rammed onto farmers and killed 6 yet his father remains in post useless govt
lets fucking go supportfarmers
why bjp seek need of new laws for farmer msp and for people caa nrc and in both cases people were not satisfied instead of giving job cleaning of rivers infrastructure etc they just misleading people for not able answer current situation of india
1 saying jat politics in western up jat leaders and their stand on farmers agitation etc this kind of language divides and presents jat community as one against all others or farm laws jats divided on farm laws i am being from this community i live in i stay in regular communication with my family members and friends i find strong sentiments on both sides of issue please sgji do not present farm laws as jat community issue farmers issue and india issue come across as if have biases when saying jat community this or that perhaps unintentional please do not generalize
if crop price about 50 thousand rupees then had spend nearly 10 thousand in transportation which at present rs 2000 due avalibility of mandis which mandis abolished by these farm bills
just indirectly trying show that these r not real farmers
but in future india needs be more vigilant proactive in fighting against planned protests foreign funding targeted bring intentional unrest in india 4g war using civil society at its peek now
maturity when u realised farmer life does not improve before farm law and goes into hell after farm law
district or county and cant sell any one outside of apmc market yards mandis
bjp cell members working overtime seems they sort by new dislike comments in favor of farmers make less people see them
thousands no billions farmers yes

modi yogi bjp government gi
thank for covering this except for 1 point violence was not done by protesting farmers but by some mischief maker discredit farmers protest this guy has his picture on facebook with top bjp leaders protest followed route agreed with police but media did not cover that
dear punjabis we did not remove indian flag did we
stay away from farmers your suggestions with we dont want your reforms
taliban have defeated united states and its allies should they not be praised for bloodless capture of kabul afghan army surrendered without any resistance did pakistan told them not resist against taliban
as very clearly pointed out by mr gupta in his commentary nobody can honestly fault intention of modi govt in farm law promulgation that essentially spells tremendous potential benefits for economic activity growth however modi govt would do very well both for itself and nation at large accept and recognize that actions like blocking of internet access and any such people unfriendly measures will eventually be resisted tooth and nail by all freedom loving indians no matter degree of whatever they might be having face
if only small percentage give up farming india will grow up as nationa
chor haii tikat jai shree ram bjp only
congratulations farmers but dnt forget what bjp has done defame

kisan union of india jindabad
my great salute all farmers
bjp have lot of time build infrastructure in afghanistan and days of debates on pakistan but our beloved farmers rotting on roads past 7 months
ego of govt has bowed down unity of farmers without farmers no nation can progress
india hell for all minorities first in pakistan we used think that only muslims facing hindu supermecy but today india made clear that anyone who not brahman hindu india not for them
these three farm laws in nutshell agitation basically against change and also due fear that middle men would be squeezed out if farmer has direct and open access markets
police should help farmers farmers lifeline for everyone survival we all do fine without politicians
jai jawan most of them farmers sons
nothing in this video i found that new bills against farmers
all i can say that punjab one of most important agriculture state in india and as far as punjabis concerned they do not give up easily they have long courageous and brave history and prety much stick their roots modi picking up fights with wrong people
farmers used govt support price and do not want gamble with market economy they just trying be like govt employees truth farmers not like govt employee they work hard and should get better price than govt support price they should know that govt makes money by selling their crop
three simple conclusions that i draw from govt repealing farm law that 1 mr modi has reiterated again that political pandits cannot predict his moves anybody saying i dont think modi will do this modi will do that shouldnt be surprised if gives credits for this directly or indirectly captain singh 2 modi has away one agenda from oppositions kit just before full fledged election campaigning begin for states election in 2022 and 3 modi should learn consult those for whom say brining laws
they paid farmers funded from outside of
being farmer does not allow disrespect law
traitor tv traitor godi media deshdrohi media has pay for every count of farmer life
farmers marc only sikhs hariyani and west up farmers marc excluding these farmers all farmers wants farm laws
logo ko election ko cover anti bjp hoke interview nhi lene thora stand bnao news walo kaam nishpaksh kaam right wing aur left wing bnna
repealing of farm laws major setback farmers
both correct debate must happen in parliament in farmers point they expressed their concern if govt agreed give msp i think good reform
if bjp thinks that they will get benefit in punjab then really good dream and now his core voters will get away with this attitude
these not real farmers but agents of congress party these so called farmers not giving any list of amendments needed in farmer laws but want withdraw these laws just satisfy their ego nothing wrong in these laws these so called kissan leaders had tarnished image of punjabis
do not say like this farmer
so all these years when bjp was in alliance with sad in punjab and in alliance with pdp in kashmir was changa now that modi and shahs incompetence and megalomania starting balloon into all round threat nation bhakts going berserk
india tv please remove india from your brand name put bjp instead because eat bjp food not that which grown by farmer we as farmer hate please do not do this farmer put effort and soul feed all and even skip meal himself please do not do this
government says bill in favour of farmers and farmers protesting which true
2 if punjab state government does not like bill they may chose not implement in their state
people saying abhiman tut ghamand tut but poor farmers who lost today
farmers innocent people they do not know much of politics so what could they do instead of blocking road ways why do not courts finish decision process of 3 farm laws and justice then
people who knew facts were supporting farmers
but farmers will surely suffer
all yogiji bhakts should remember that yogiji yet win single election in his name so hold your horses
damaging ind for his own using farmers for his own sake anti national should be in prison
farmer saktey farmer khun shame on congress and other party thhuuuhh
how dare that policemen beat farmer who so old how dare beat person who gives food
farmers who feel sad should have co e out streets support why did they not
farm reform necessary my extended family majority farmers and i understand farmers problem but then something like farmer tribunal or any other organisations necessary explain contract farmers and regulate prices and mediate contracts so companies do not make self profiting contracts
political conception thats why only opposition state opposing this common farmer not affected
we indian we farmer
rakesh developing talibabi mindset in india should be immediately checked otherwise will create situation disintegrate india if indian understand situation in afghanistan and pakistan and their attitudes towards india they will definitely vote for modi in 2024 and 2029 save country from gajwai hind
now its clear who these so called farmers

nice see that publisher named hindu has remained objective while other medias like have become properties of modi
had no choice modi on his knees farmers did
this acts more favorable towards company and not legally empower farmers
professions equally important farmers just like another profession there no need put them on pedestal some people quote them as andh datta that without farmers there will be no food and as such must support them what if there were no doctors nurses frontliners many would hv died during this pandemic what if there were no jawans police security personal there would be anarchy what if there were no bankers money lender there would financial system will collapse etc etc bottom line everyone
what happened indian government why not pay attention farmers rights
shame after knowing what anti national citizen doing nothing done despose criminal behind kissan andolan both government and tikkait looks like same team creating problems for farmers and bharat

now recent talks has made some changes in bills government has made clear that msp will be provided in written problem with taking knowledge till farmers and make them understand in 2019 many opposition and farmer groups protested implement this act best way analyze this act by implementing for year this should be studied as case study after implementation but not on assumptions

u have explainef v clearly sir i think positive effects of these bills r more than its negative effects if farmers can handle smartly then this bill will b good for them and they can bcoz new generation of farmers r smart and net friend ly
talking about msp and farmers freedom sell their produce for higher price just like debating about chip in 2000 note during demonetization discussing tax evasion during introduction of gst actuall issue survival of states let know that 60 percent of taxes collected from farmers used meet salaries of land revenue department by state governments if farming sector collapses and if over by foreign corporates then they will pay gst central government not state governments then how state governments will run and taxes or cess collected at mandis or market yards used by state governments meet emergency needs if both these sources of income curtailed how can states survive state governments back bone of indian union if states done away with like this india would be thrown into anarchy like situation
i think people of having little thinking and sense brainwashed innocent farmers and incited them for protesting for their political benefits

can not compare america with india america has alternative employment means for its people india has not there no small farmers left in america
now farmers should move delhi parliament and india gate lal qila
if contract farming beneficial or farmer gets better rates outside apmc without mandi tax and all then why bihar agriculture system staggering
bjp need not worry about any negative electoral impact and in fact bound gain very positively lot electorally both in long and short run but crucial and some what urgent need of hour that bjp should deploy its best communication and campaign skills in dispelling countering negating poisonous extremely negative and very wide inimical campaign started by many rich farmers and very rich arthriyas middlemen in absolute collaboration with some political parties that against bjp against new 3 farm laws in order influence poor and marginal farmers of jats and of india also
i from bihar i support farmers protest up we all r with u drna ni h
people who targeting sikhs when sikhs retaliate than guys hide under ur beds hindu sikhs together in punjab sikhs and hindus who were brought india in 1991 still waiting on citizenship and extending visas they dont want leave there business in afghanistan and i can see some hate flashing in comments since sikhs in canada strong dont hate but follow
farmers ones feeding in this earth so they should be treated well farming there source of income
man who drove car over farmers was son of minister
wth farmers we shall overcome
rubika ji becoming baseless anchor always target opposition and those persons who disagree with govt media ask questions govt if agitation going on road govt responsible if people suffering govt responsible if any riots or violence occure govt responsible all those so as india democratic country
modi has made his puppets as cm in every bjp ruling state
what about those farmers who willing and happy with additional option sell
modi bhakt always favours bjp
vice did not even througly discuss new farm bills
start systematic targeting of godi media do not let those anchors rest peacefully godi media ko kootna shuru karon
pictures found of aman nihang meeting with bjp top leaders of punjab clicked few day before this incidents
finally arrogance has been shattered by determination of farmers
only punjab and haryana farmers have problem with this law because of middlemen and dalals

farmers will stay on borders until government comes table msp on 23 fassals in law needed by farmers vote chot no vote for bjp bjp will loose state governments indian from uk
priya mam critacal l clear my all dout regarding this farmers issue thank
andhbhkts who called farm protest as international conspiracy today talking about democracy andhbhkts who called farmers as traitors anti nationals goons khalistani today talking about national interests even chameleon do not change colour so fast
thankyou for addressing farmers as farmers
state like bihar do not have mandi system they have private sector who never give them appropriate price of there crop bihar already have private sector for buying crop from farmers from past 10 years than also bihar farmers poorest in country with 5000 monthly income where as state like haryana who have govt mandis farmer income 14 000 per month so bringing private sector in agriculture surely not solution of this problem problem remove middle man or make law for compulsury followed by all states and increase wearhouse system where govt can store good amount of food sell other country india on no 1 sell food in international market than also indian farmers poorest world
this not done i very disappointed by modi ji what benefit of having 300 seats and still cannot implement bills on ground this set example of any group people can come together and oppose any bill block roads and pressurise government revoke that bill so what benefit of having power those bills were wrong than why earlier support those bills and argued on very stage i do not think there any benefit of having majority government anymore
see farmers misinformed about msp laws dont have anything do with msp itself and govt has assured that also apmc with thier msp will not go even after 100 years if apmc act undisturbed its actually farmers choice that they want sell in mandi or private sector so punjabs farmers should continue sell in mandi and dont sell in private sector
i don t know why govt does not give its ensurance poor farmer regarding msp
in short this bill very good for farmers thanks
real farmers not wolves in sheepskin enjoyed reaped benefits of 3 farm laws for nearly year
and winner indian farmer

government response has been fervently against repealing laws same as farmers refuse buckle so government also maintaining peaceful resilience politics aside no one has been harmed
modi ji should agree demands of farmers farmers backbone of nation if everything privatised then what will these farmers do
pm modi one pm who has will never do anything that against nations interest sadly well educated articulated man like aim being soooo short sighted
in western up there was some infouence of farmers protest and few votes itself could throw bjp out

sad see these illiterate farmers and their so called leaders with vested interests protesting for something fictitious like thinking that government will stop providing msps farm produce those who do not know dime about indian agriculture system my advice google little and gain some knowledge about dire issues that this law intends address would have been fine if farmers were protesting after govt has back msp support which never gonna happen because no political party dumb enough lose farmers vote which about 70 of working class huge number believe me by cutting down msps
we support farmers

those who say this shameless they never felt shame on our govt when 150 farmers died gave shaheedi while protesting
fact india now incredibly polarized country where one group of vocal people would support government no matter what and another equally vocal group would oppose government no matter what people rejoicing in yesterday win would do well remember this there will come time that they too will sit in power and bjp could very well use exact same tactics bring country halt would that fight be worth only time will tell

not victory for farmers already lost 700 lives modi co should get punishment for that
my question surplus fci has why dont they sell corporates farmers would be happy that they getting their money and fci would not be in debt concerns of farmers that if its open market and theres surplus who would buy if its fci that would buy surplus then whats difference with current situation right approach should be government should sell corporates or export excess
submission will not bring anything good for bjp or india

there huge disconnect between farmers workers laborers and urban middle class elite section agri business of indian society people who mostly discussing this issue including this well meaning young youtuber running finology have no clue about actual problems of farming in india most dangerous thing that bureaucracy and political class which actually makes laws and implement thru bureaucracy in india totally obliviant when comes farming farming in india very diverse and each region has its own issues that why was supposed be state subject instead of central govt concurrent list crux of most problems that india being run from delhi instead of giving more power each state and in centralized decision making states not represented equally with current dispensation we slowly moving towards disintegration of india so enjoy living in bubble as longs as can
your channel should report on msp guarantee and how farmers will benefit vis vis broker involvement earlier
not surprised by vox why they come up such scripts three new farm bills were very much needed this hour and farmers have been heard for first time ignoring bill will only cause big merchants from punjab and haryana exploit farmers in india contract farming new revolution where we can get utmost benefit with its results unlike other protest even this protest funded by khalistanis left opposition parties etc

at last clarity i hope farmers come their senses watching this
masters stroke of modi ji
for point 1 i think there startups now which already helping farmers with seeds and other tech inputs they can also provide legal services for farmer when dealing with corporates
was not farmers who were agitating but brokers and commision agents who had nexus with corporate world what ever be farmers bigger loss
then our godi media which certainly has different objective so they were usual parrot of bjp anyway they no longer consequential pls up good work and wishing u success
rakesh ticket and yogendra yadav enjoying and earning money from 18 months now both can also enjoy further 3 months afterward they have count time in seconds as yogi will legal action
its high time support farmers they fighting for our survival and we should be ashamed of ourselves if we not doing anything support farmers protest
this seems like conspiracy seems as if jat leaders trying settle score with raj kumar saini under grab of farmer protest
when procurement season opens then govt provides around 40 50rs qunital aadhtiya not farmers and before farm laws also farmers were free sell their crops in open market govt making fool of people who not associated with farming and spreading wrong information

difficult bring any reform or bill in india
check sahyadri farms formed in nashik maharashtra farmer collective for selling fruits and vegetables
but i still do not get finally boils down which choice farmer makes right
one thing not mentioning in this argument that assumption of bill that private sector will be fair farmers with supposed monopoly of apmc being gone their power support farmers will also be weakened without structured government support and stable rights for farmers like msp even in corporate markets there will be monopolisation again in private sector that why farmers protesting because they do not trust govt
i son of farmer and whatever told 100 true
sahe pta cause farmers never blocks road nd creates problem
tikait was only puppet in name of farmers why had not made any movement when thousands of people committed in maharashtra during 2006 20011
this anchor of abp could answer questions of mr tikait about bjp govt but rather cleverly ignored them
just thinking bjp or taliban
thank trevver sir doing job what indian media should do
this so sad for farmers who real poor which idea propagates and influences everyone and which needed does not farmers protesting from states which only represents few percentage of all indian farmers these protesters among rich ones what about farmers who committing suicides in present scenario of laws prevalent in india those farmers want changes doesnt need be changed these laws which being introduced not new these also used in usa there some flaws but could be amended
farmers real back bone of economy must remain open and free everyone
your analysis barely perfect example of your biases out of 7 minutes and 46 seconds have spent over 5 minutes talking about troublemakers and how they should have followed rules and less than 20 seconds on what causality was sitting on moral high horse and telling farmer leaders maintain peace easy but if have over million followers listening least can do explain them what could have caused this unrest and violence aapko sach farak padta
why using teargas farmers in so called democratic country
ha ha ha proud of this country i will be super happy when goes down drain come on people vote for modi and bjp plssssssssss let make lowest nation on earth

3 govt should provide storage facilities farmers with minimal charges without loss
simple and clear explanation of bill but u missed mention that farmer can choose his buyer and no force or legal obligations sell private companies if still chooses sell apc gets msp support or company get more than msp price king if manages better
remember india when raised your so called tiranga in our harmandir sahib golden temple thats same pain but truth we used rule delhi afghanistan and our flag used be on top of red fort even before your indian flag was born
election phir laayenge bill
they were all khalistani no real farmers n sachi farmer hote modi bye bye
this too much harrassment of farmers
if captain bjp alliance forms govt in punjab will really victory for poor famers across india
india very complex system where middle class enjoy cheap food prices and farmers receive low prices for their crop as they currently not allowed store crop pay high prices for inputs and do not have ability protect themselves with futures contracts current system in india not sufficient support all small farmers in india they lack scale produce store and market their own products free market can only work which these bills seek do if both buyers and sellers have equal bargaining power smaller farmers not only lacking skill but also knowledge effective participate in free market they free they will be crushed under low prices government should offer assistance and compensate for farmers harmed by these laws until economy normalized india need grow beyond having millions of small farmers and farmers need accept their faith but i think government did not do good job in marketing these bills also people of punjab well off farmers compared rest of india if look at number of children being sent outside from punjab study in college would understand why punjabis at heart of protest they enjoy highest income in country from farming any threat their lifestyle would bring about reaction many of those protesting have on name brand clothes nike adidas and drive audis these not lowly farmers of bihar
these farmers protesting against 3 controversial laws that were hushed through parliament in pandemic without consultation of farmers laws taking away livelihood of farmers in name of reforms by giving corporates authority control agriculture this will push prices up of crop in future which will be beyond reach of ordinary indian these farmers feeding millions free of charge through gurdwaras langars when disasters occur worldwide or at protests as we see on youtube lot of protestors and freelance journalists going missing police have arrested many by fabricating charges being falsely reported that these protestors terrorists these farmers have sons in army and police guarding dangerous indian borders so these rich people can sleep at night present pm gujrati gujratis do not have soldiers that die for country farmers honest hardworking truthful people that have trusted bjp government but now realise that they have put bjp as elected dictatorship bjp since power have implemented anti muslim laws caused divisions on ground of religion and now portraying sikhs as anti national element actions of gujrati pm bjp fiercely contested by public extent that government have used tear gas batons barbed wired and concrete barriers silence protest this has got attention worldwide so now government trying defend its actions not rocket science understand that when controversial laws forced on public will cause outrage

maybe action in pok maybe ucc if so tactical retreat also amarinder certainly factor could not have supported bjp without revoking farm laws but what end game time will tell if there wasnt anything else then would be defeat for modi
farmers backbone of our country politicians so short sighted no funny
actually in this law problem created not for farmers however problem created consumers and brokers in this law there many amendment must be done like storage limit and price in market must be regulate by govt otherwise private sector will do monopoly and at end consumer will suffer
all saying that opposition politicizing farm laws why why decided repeal does that means even bjp politicising
phati yaad this power of farmers
farmers number one that uplift nations full support should give them
and rest of indian country farmers happy that they can sell
in end repeal of laws in absence of most indian states turning back clock means nothing in real terms

2nd bill will give farmers chance sell outside mandis but this does not necessarily mean that govt will try get out of agriculture business can definitely sell in mandis too will just have both options which pretty good deal for farmers

problems faced by both farmers and nation collectively but implementation of these laws will not have effect they intend have for example hoarding law removal will prevent mismanagement of stock but will also cause well hoarding and then there no provision against that so excluding such crops from essential commodities just gain that one law not answer more thorough inspection needed of these laws but government stubbornness does not help

this not just mistake of government mistake of farmers that they do not learn new methods and market and just want everything from government and do not want user their own brain learn new things in farming most of them uneducated and never learn anything on other side government mistake that they did not asked for opinions of farmers and pass this bill on their own no government can help farmers other than education whether modi govt or any other upcoming govt this same don t blame govt of everything i see attitude of punjab so much relying on govt
1 msp minimum support price guaranteed so there nothing that farmers will get less that minimum price
looks like what indian government doing good for country food security e g several corporations will purchase regulate and store food which will help prevent famines and control prices and inflation
none of these politicians for nation or farmers all of them well aware of but

farmers still protesting peacefully government and some people tried fail protest on 26 jan
opposition along with fringe elements were planning something huge in name of farmer protest now 3 laws repealed
with farmers
i tolly agree with this video but resons behind why farmers protesting in my opinion this that particular farmer in haryana and punjab mostly grows wheat and rice mainly small farmers and when they have sell their products they will get less prices and when they have buy other products like pulses grams patotes etc they have pay more as said in video prises will get increased and
they never did farming nor worked in farm but earns more money than actual farmer
farmer laws were all good i think government should not them back they made mistake
hats off farmers
proud of our indian farmer
everyone opposed farmer law but what i noticed young people hesitating oppose on mic where as senior people voice clear loud without hesitation when we and our generation learn oppose straight forward

from this video i dont find any violent protest though i have no full coverage or information of this protest however from what i see on video shows that peaceful protesters been stopped by police and when not stopped they have beaten up brutally if this case then i condemn action if situation was different than what show then i would not comment but one thing what i understand that conducting peaceful protest our right and no one in this country can stop from doing that n one more point i want highlight that if tomorrow farmers stop farming and stop production then humko ghar ugake khana padega this message for andhbhakts think before blindly supporting some one or and ideology

excellent analysis shekhar sir although i am modi supporter but i still like your unbiased comments coz your comments and analysis of any national issue well balanced i am also of same view on farm laws laws beneficial and in interest of farming community but problem big farmers of punjab and arhtiyas i have been punjab these arhtiyas very influential people who themselves big farmers they earn huge amount of commission every year from afmc they will never allow other marketing institutions come up secondly parali burning issue but perhaps govt came under pressure from sc on issue when govt ready make necessary changes then why they adamant they do not represent farmers of entire country and this nothing but gundagardi that we will block delhi

okay i am also angry of what modi announced but we do not have option right now other than bjp time yogi ji and hemant biswa ji comes up with new party so that bjp stops taking hindus for granted
new farm laws will not only affect farmers but also citizens who rely on farm products directly or indirectly changes uplift agriculture and farmers lifestyle definitely required but must also involve understanding their issues at ground level and working on solutions around small inconvenience in our life uplift our farmers lives least we could

but responsibility for fall of kabul lies with afghanistan only in two decades afghanistan has received billions of dollars in economic and military aid and support from world india and other countries have invested billions of dollars in nation building usa trained and equipped afghanistan military and provided billions of dollars in aid but there was lack of political will and civic will defend itself against extremist groups political leaders gave up against 70 80k taliban fighters 300000 military surrendered and civilians opted flee or hide instead of protesting and fighting for their rights and future when there no factor within country there no will power then its downfall inevitable because when do not decide fight yourself no one will stand for
great farmers
however brother there little criticism that i would like offer map of india shown in this video was inaccurate and showed various parts of kashmir as part of pakistan which by international recognition and treaties part of india that kind of offending me as indian hoping will make amends in your coming videos and mention this wishing all very best

bjp has fears farmers bjp crony capitalist party not for farmers poor middle class
some people commenting that modi scared of elections but one thing i want remember everyone india not only depend on punjab or haryana and also top states like karnataka tamilnadu maharashtra etc which in front row in contributing for indian development u cannot see major strike against farmer bills that means these states does not have farmers no but here farmers also educated i want give one example in karnataka for 1kg of onion priced between 60 70rs but farmer who grow onion will get only 20 25 per kg but broker will get profit upto 30 per kg how strange broker will get more profit compared farmers or customers this 3 laws passed prevent these unethical fraudulent agriculture market but some idiots like rakesh tikayath diverted reasons behind these laws so first try educate do not follow dumb people

farmers very important in building of this nation their voices should be heard by this evil government thanks quint for reporting real national lssues
wrong explanation fact now big corporates can buy directly from farmers and anyone with pan can be trader so more options for farmers sell problem apmc can be completely skipped impacting their profit and corruption by middle men will be low
so this all about farmers not wanting government subsidies disappear and privatization of land unless there need for these crops justify subsidies perhaps not so many indians should be in farming at this point

kishan bill right
good explanation however most important issue consider before any of issues mentioned in this video and one which often missed that as per constitution agriculture state government matter and only states can make new laws or amend existing laws union government has no right interfere in this matter this forms foremost reason why farmers demanding repealing these laws as blatant violation of constitutional powers of states rest of issues follow unscripted please add this your next videos
this video was very useful tysm now all my doubts and clear and i proudly say that i support farmers istandwithfarmers farmers
but indian voters have been distracted by rhea kangana and ram mandir etc
if govt really wants improve condition of farmers then why not increase price of msp and make legal right
bjp knows they will not come in power again so they building their bank accounts by increasing petrol and cylinder price
raam mandir enough for them cast votes if hindu will be in danger then llife has no meaning modi imp save hindutva
farmers modi repeals no use as your status quo not changed well learn from naxalite guard your rights
punjabi farmers should protest against government world governments nowadays getting so corrupt and making stupid decisions
msp be followed not only by govt apmp but also by all other mandies and private purchase business people prices should be more than msp but not less than msp and many farmers have pay huge money for transport depending on distance from his agricultural land market place govt need look into these matters if govt wants really help farmers

one truth was said by cop afsar from farmer parivar explains village mentality that city cops have about women young couples and night life in general
thing that farmers not ready hear at all so gov also should not introduce any reform for these fools there clearly written in bill no land of farmers will be and if farmers do not agree with corporates sell there produce then do not sell and anyway i think in open market without trade farmer can sell at better price and its not that farmers not getting msp they getting more msp as compared 2014 so i think we must support farm bills
i realize one thing these farmers more educated than me

price assurance minimum support prices which has been in place for decades this price assured by govt and there laws ensure msp rice example when farmer takes rice mandi its qualitatively analyzed and price paid then there there no going back and claiming quality issues being from farming family i do happen know this
when govt escaping social responsibilities do not want procure crops want stop all farm subsidies then only farmers demanding their crops price definition because corporates very big player there no match between them and buyer moreover there will be new order comes into effect that purchaser changing hand from govt corporates

excellent content just wondering not there alternative in way this policy can be redone or whether this can be done state wise so that state can decide what they want states like punjab can opt out or even better can success of this policy be showcased in one or more bjp run states and then rolled on other states sad that entire country held on ransom by subset of people so simplistic believe capitalists will just come and exploit farmers and govt will looking other way does not bjp want come back power they do so they will doing course correction fix loop wholes and bring good shape even extent of repealing if required when time comes diversity of india also and not letting progress in many ways
they had do this bjps graph after punjab haryana in up was declining plus recent loss in lok sabha seats in hp

i dont understand this point of govt should expand their purchase more markets why should they buying more than required and waste tax payer public money which otherwise could be used build infrastructure for farmers build better technology for farmers use and expand their markets sell already govt purchase has gone beyond their limits and loss exchequer why we r behaving like educated fools and getting carried away in this protest govt should not engage in any business they should concentrate on building infrastructure engage agri ministry agri universities and village panchayat create framer procurement organisations fpo and through them every farmer can sell their products either mandi or outside mandi however farmer wishes and gets better price its better move away from mandi while making no impact farmers and also get benefit for end users in all this we forget about general public who bare and burden 1 pay tax 2 pay higher roll price for products be grains or pulses or processed products why should public suffer at cost of others benefit for years and years when public will ever get any benefit let rich farmers give away their subsidies given they have better standard of living they way general public have given away subsidies for gas let rich farmers help their farmer brother who have less land or no land but work as labour get benefit from new laws and facilities provided by govt or any association that set up help farmers produce more and get better pricing

i have watched full video and understand that acts good and need changes as sir said but i think they soo complicated if farmer did one mistake will loose 1 crop income or 5 year income acts should be simple and agreement should not be on may government should put in will rest depend on farmers
i am from lakhimpur kheri this incident looks planned and method somehow effect stability as elections very near

why general public being harassed by these farmers businesses trader industry has already suffered too much from blockage of roads patients have suffered from these blockage of roads

under new bills contracting farming approach does not guarantee msp suggested that one of fundamental demands from farmers several political leaders example haryana cm misleading people if govt really wants help farmers they should work with farmer organizations improve existing apmc system they should see swaminathan commission report for recommendations official study done by govt 2004 2006
farmers from punjab cannot does not represent farmers of whole country
thats why farmers should start cooperative based agricultural sector save there life

same happens with moong urad cotton and other crops only we as farmers want be able sell our crops atleast on msp modi govt bill only need add this one clause that if anyone buys from farmers below msp there will be severe consequences so that can ensured that farmers life not left at plight of corporations
other news farmers terrorist talwa chat sarkar
congress ncp all these parties ruined all good efforts of bjp
why cannot pm go and talk with farmers and explain this
this very important fight between hardworking farmers and corrupt crony government whole india with farmers 2022 deciding year for this fight when bjp will loose every state election
poor farmers deserve their own country in punjab
all other party should stop going interviews and they should ask and call only bjp and modi for interview sawaal pucho
in this time farmers have got success in india government has withdrawn all three laws
farmers need accept fact that privatisation only thing which can make farmers prosper in long run how inefficient bureaucracy can be seen from fact that since past 50 years just farming has not led anh good for farmers
imagine farmer protest gets joined by ordinance factory workers and caa protestors backed by shivsena and congress modi shah will have no escape
i am very satisfied with your video on topic but have asked question that why do police need use tear gas so very clear that police can do lathi charge if protestors get violent but they did not do that and we know that violent protestors attack cops and how police were pulled back and injured so what left with police police there for just beaten up by protestors as not single farmer was injured by police hence they have use tear gas control mob when they trying pull down bus clear road and if there confusion with route then responsibility of leader although if farmers were confused then in confusion they start attacking police and start moving closed routes and start breaking barriers i don t think anyone can do that in confusion
please at least now stop addressing them as farmers
i come from india where newslaundry independent media
sir i agree with all of what where were support bill now supporting
2 contract farming possible without any acts then why bring this new regulatory act which looks more beneficial affluent contract farmer farming companies
do know that how much farmers suffering due not getting msp every job has hiked its salary in last 50 years but farmers incomes remains same my father farmer i know how much important cut all subsidies but atleast give msp farmers not even able pay for investment how do think they will feed there children my father has open up other business just survive and give good life even after having 200 acres of farm government can easily support as they provide so much other working class and economical feasible example of brazil for sugarcane corn and wheat for north america i go though all of your stories and they very much point but about this topic i am disappointed because just took one side and showed other should have thrown more light after research dont give subsidies tax but at least give msp so that people know which crop they should invest in and every acre of land if difference may have 20 acres suitable for sugarcane but may also have 2 acres in central not suitable for agriculture has so many risks in that with this structure not going be too long when people just leave farming
do not away innocence of children personally feel bad when i see child being fronted for political objective i wish all involved speedy resolution in interest of both farmers and country
government usually forces farmer sell locally at low prices so that they can supply subsidized rice urban consumers or rice price low in cities
look looters threten rise khalistan movement of they not let loot they have already shown their international might even by making canada president talking for them oganising events in many places in world how these middlemen exploit punjabi sentiment for their selfish purpose
strange situation that law farmers want being denied and law they do not want being implemented
they asking for msp minimum support price
there appears no use of discussion at time of promulgation and no use at time of repeal everything decided by majority which ensured after election results declaration and govt formation whole process democratic people saying
tikait owns petrol pumps this news correct please confirm also i read that earlier supported bills and thanked modi also if each household not sending rep penalty that these so called farmer leaders have threatened request something on these points please sir we need see both sides
people who arguing this will bad for farmers these people who never been agriculture area

all very good say that farmer can sell anywhere but does have resources does have resource fight sharks who dictate prices have laws been made understandable for them does have resource resist corporate pressure grow what wants instead of what corporates dictate this all farce where infrastructure for farmers before this law can be effected
farming industry massive tough get everyone on board for vision of pm modi hope logic prevails

huge huge respect for farmers i overwhelmed by their enthusiasm and unity and guys have been truly amazing for capturing such stories and showing people reality of thr situation awesome work guys god bless
5 making farmers aware about all government schemes through mobile radio tv fertilizer and seed shops and panchayat
can believe that india producing double amount of food grains that we actually need its high time that we go back organic farming just way our grandfathers used do farming with traditional compost and not urea
how all members can support repeal of law which in truth would help farmer and country
firstly they requested and demanded these farm law be repealed
who has came here support farmers
people say modi only repealed them because wants votes in upcoming elections but not this what democracy all about because india has democracy that modi forced listen farmers voices and repeal these laws were india more authoritarian country these farmers would be crushed and head of state would cling on power as usual
overall this bill will benefit adani and ambani and farmers will left with nothing and we can say that this another master stroke by our pm help their corporate friends
my support only farmers
where farmer in india most of them drove out from field and remains will be left after this bill
farmers no these people jokers
do not beg modi for your rights make your own free n fair kisan desh for punjab haryana up n rajasthan kisan rocket launcher force
move ahead of u p elections but still great win for farmers
for solve msp price problem demolish life commodities act make farming market free market
this govt will block roads paths pass ways for delhites win cheap publicity fie on this govt provoke and instigate farmers against delhi public chaddi baaz fie on them
i too dontt support these farm laws but there should also be solution for avoiding farmers repeatedly harvesting wheat and paddy due msp and leading ground water depletion also subsidies if possible should be channelled small land owning farmers rather than being generalised one
modi nothing done for farmers so far
why no one asking eyewitnesses that why they saw tamasha of killing reporter and bjp volunteers did nothing help or themselves indulged in beating them death like most farmers as seen in video and question of wearing bhindravale shirt
win of democracy farmers tell power of right protest dhikkaar logo ko kisano ko anti national agar farm bills ache hote farmers protest nhi
nice video but i have one doubt if most of farmers were anyway selling their produce outside apmc what new in what first farm law saying not this already allowed
bastards must be in prison who killed innocent farmers
they shame in name of farmers
please make two way communication hold pc talk with farmers we do not want one way communication
good bye job well done by farmers and ajit anjum
thank great patriot mohamano modi ji trust our ordinary kirshan bhais will understand this and regret they were sucked into politically motivated traitors and will regret later when will be too late jai hind and bharat mata jai

poor dk singh his leader has let him down this man did not once mention deficiency in bills and why farmers opposed them just saying that they were reforms
farmer they seriously farmer still
seems that many journalists were in hibernation and suddenly woke up after farm law was repealed and started claiming that they know actual truth
krte krte 2024 dekhte lkn tumne beech aakr bill wapas krwa dia might be farmers income increase krta
i feel these laws will be back this looks be tactical withdrawal i support farm laws and was disappointed when they were withdrawn however i very very heartened that modi took back laws even at cost of his reputation that tells me that not drinking his own ego need really be concerned about leader who inflexible because of his image and ego that me further strengthens my belief in bjp and modi
1 small farmers of punjab and haryana and farmers of all other states were not protesting
this good video seems be slight tilt towards right wing me laughable hear any political motives from other parties bjp bjp has been ruthless handling opposition my guess people farmer opposing farm law since they do not have trust on private sector and weakening of govt market and msp will hurt them
we as indians without doubt should support our beloved farmers and hope government and farmers find solution
frankly speaking what happened today country going oppose farmer protest
this bill will benefit farmers but their fear also right govt has come up with middle way
rip all brave 700 farmers
saving nation before uplifting farmers very hard decision
i stand with farmers
i am amazed at such sinister incessant propaganda by ht against ik means ik on right track now i understand why mughals your ancestors slave for centuries one cannot expect sanity from society who chose modi as their pm

crooks who came power on promise of better governance and putting farmers at forefront has become biggest enemy of farmers and public who sympathize with farmers thanks brainpower of andbhakts
in agriculture no farmer wants have low quality because quality directly proportional quantity
killing 4 bjp leaders and drivers burning thier vehicle by farmers unacceptable those who conspirators must be punished
ultimately more more farming population would be required move white blue collar jobs but first provided these jobs created by incentivising make in india industries education health manufacturing industries and giving level playing field states like punjab which border state while states alongside given incentives for industry set up by centre giving them tax holidays whereas industry heavily taxed here
this not democracy log protest nhi kr in farmers law ko favour kr and bjp ko vote logo u justice

now i would love see ndtv who condemning parliament attacks and people who did riots on republic day and every farmer leaders should get punished these desperate times govt should single out every one and punsih them for their deed
even if say modi has ego ex congress leader manmohan agreed that modiji greatest leader
msp used by rich farmers artiyas transport harvested crops from other states like rajasthan up by farmers artiyas and then sold govt agencies in mandis at msp as locally harvested produce

contract farming beej aaujar khad contractor deta
can someone explain if as said 94 farmers not using apmc sell their produce so i believe they still being exploited regarding pricing as they do not get msp so why farmers protesting if most of them do not use present services seems that did not cover entire situation and there much more that what describing here
glad international media taking coverage please cover modi job do if possible
i pity those farmers who have been mislead by some politicians into believing that farm bills not good
modi fuddu why addressing bigar and not talking about protest and doubts of people of punjab

thank bro get me brief knowledge about farmer law
bill has support from majority of farmers from other parts of country this fact also subsidies enjoyed by punjab and haryana actually robbing subsidies of farmers from other region this must stop in garb of msp farmers of these two states dumps their substandard produce mandis basmati rice they never sell in mandis they already selling high cost rice like basmati directly corporates rice and wheat that we get from pds ration shop actually grains that govt forced buy even though supply more than demand try eating rice and wheat from ration shop then will know what i am talking about currently since there guaranteed msp they produce quantity but not quality and dump those mandis i want support genuine farmer but surely would not support who just behind money and does not care anything about quality currently this case of farmers from punjab and haryana
this true face of modi rss india shame on this police
i came after pm announced repeal if farm laws predicted correctly i appreciate shekar ji
west u p farmers also participating in protest from starting and in huge number media not covering west up farmers because they wanna portray only punjab farmers having problem
google if need be free trade policy and as why present govt did not sign rcep where in most of neighbouring countries have signed in because govt cares for farmers upliftment
farmers we with
finally win farmers
i think india of no use taliban india must focus on internal matters first
i think need approach some data collect company who can collect all small medium high farmers
farm laws indeed big good thing for farmers surprisingly well do farmers in punjab and haryana want status quo continue farmers from other states do see huge benefit from farm laws left elements and opposition have been very good at enhancing confusion since this issue happening in mid term not going influence 2024 elections unnecessarily they robbing farmers from escalating new heights in field of agriculture
this episode should urgently be translated in all reginal languages and tv broad casted in all states in india through channels which farmers normally view
today i lost inner respect for all indian farmers i will never ever respect any farmer from now onwards till my last breath today farmers have hurt pride of our and their own nation too india will never forget this unethical brutal attack by farmers on their own nation if we have such farmers we do not need pakistan and china witness our down fall and after today incident i now think farmers deserve some hardships today they insulted our own nation on international level
farmers right here
as per i heard farmers fearing that if they can sell in any part of country their own mandis might get weakened because that only hope of selling their products if fci does not accept all foods actual case so that will ultimately lead them doing contract farming which will be just for sake of company and that they will have sell their products anywhere at low cost them if mandis become non existent and will ultimately be like jio v airtel battle i feel their pain but no government gives respect any farmers be congress or bjp all just bunch of evils ruling country
history repeated godi media
they not farmers there aim build khalistan in punjab they want seperate some of them being brain wash
i know farmers one who make their entire life struggling for
why only prosperous farmers of punjab protesting
taliban coming attack india
2 16 open auctions with transparent pricing this whole issue neither auctions open nor pricing transparent arthias dealers group up in each mandi and decide common highest bid above which no other arthia will go ground reality very different then theory arthias bullies and their no real oversight in mandis people who meant actually overlook functioning of mandi and protect farmers do exact opposite they team up with arthias or more precisely they issue arthia license only their family members relatives gain monopoly over market
bjp should look for new leader modi too old and nowadays more concerned about his image building than national interests we need strong leader not coward

this media so driven by their trp and profits that they only showing worst of protests show complete truth where farmers explain why they going delhi
number 250 million factually incorrect not single farmer protesting in southern india because we already doing contract farming for years only in north protest happening and protestors not more than 10 million
suspendmodi from rajyasabha for blatantly lying about msp being in farm bill
earlier farmers has no time run their farms now farm laws made them fight against mncs in courts
if im farmer with small holding of which there many such farmers in india having access oligarchy of larger market not going help me much if at all
even if farmers feel that contract terms do no suit them they free opt for present system ie may go for msp
every food growing by farmer respect farmers

now this matter has gone out of country canadian pm trudeau also supporting farmers shame on govt for spoiling our country name
bjp tractors
muslims protested against caa they were called pakistanis
farmers protest has became icon of democracy that great victory of peaceful protest
reason for protest imho way bills ordinance law was pushed through closest analogy i can think of if someone barges into house with suitcase that claims goodies for occupants any occupant would ask him his goodies and get out if intruder says i will not open suitcase but leave her unopened for 18 months occupants would still say get out how many of have had experience where someone barges without knocking maybe with something official or legal we would insist person get out knock and walk in only after give permission in such circumstances if its true nothing else but repealing laws will work and longer inevitable prolonged more risk of something flaring up and things going beyond everybody control and also more prolonged only makes opposition stronger
farmers do not beat police they in duty if wanna beat so beat amit shah
thank finally modi govt had no choice but all farmers must be aware not over yet this repeal has happen in parliament modi govt will have go into parliament seeking for repeal same people went and got this approved overnight fight not over
india stands with bjp not with middlemen whole nation behind narendra modi

why we farmers protesting
not even single word came out of neither from amit shah and modi for farmers
great stateman believes in democracy protest have gone for too long just saying listens may be later for farm laws when really needed india as one nation
punjab state has 50 000 middlemen each of them charges 2 5 commission pm modi has done away with them this has got nothing do with msp no govt has provided better msp than this govt but from where 2 5 commission will come corruption should prevail
after sacrificing around 700 human life farmers win and blood of over 700 human life quench government thirst

gov subsidy must be removed epically for rich farmers
kudos sir best explanation of farm laws in simplest possible way up only things that objections laws should have been elaborated more some channels claiming that 1 laws with farm protection dealing with contract farming will give opportunities buying corporates e g reliance dictates terms of food qualities thereby giving them chance penalize farmer for so called bad quality as per contract term 2 law regarding storage limits of crop or farm produce will give farmer good chance sell produce but will increase prices of farm commodities please throw some more light on objections farm produce reform acts in next lecture
i am always support my farmers
proud of u bjp get out from india
these laws not against apmc or msp they create broader aspect which would no more restrict farmers mandis help prevent post harvest loss and wastage abolish intermediaries that would led bigger shares of price farmers from consumers there this misconception being spread that mandis would no longer exist which not true
all india farmers stand up together now please go delhi now please go
they not farmers opposition parties
who running for plane we called them rajakar remember bangladesh independence war there were lots of like them who helped pakistan against bangladeshi mukti jodda freedom fighter
why dont modi just increase benchmark if really wants help farmers
for farmers their produce only source they can survive and farmers should be left alone do their work why does govt succumbing big pvt players trespass and create problems for farmers govt can make provisions against for big farmers exploiting small farmers but bringing outside giant players will eat up both small and big farmers more so because govt and govt bodies will dance tunes of giant pvt players farmer community will disappear or stop existing
thank god that farmers voices finally heard
do will understand what just did haha mind blowing stroke just snatched out slight advantage that opposition gained against him with this krishi andolan bullshit modiji genius
firstly as your video says only 6 of farmers sold in apmcs why they now even bothering about something that they never cared about west bengal largest producer of vegetables in india ca not see anyone from wb protesting and lastly nowhere in bill says that in favour of companies neo liberalism tangent from this topic
mileage of tractor generally about 9kms l
indian media never covered foreign countries protest on farm laws
sbse cool style cover farmers protest ko
95 percent of agriculture land owned by 2 percent of land lords in rural india any farm laws meaningless majority of indians
ur suggestions like playing with fire any missteps and we might have pay much greater price than these measly farm laws
my dear meghnad only 6 farmers in nation get benefits of msp all others get lesser price than msp i always support your initiative in news media but have less info on farming just like any other city guy
thank sir for supporting farmers
add your presentation current system flawed that govt never made serious effort create sustainability for farmers rather used them solve its problem of revenue loss due import of rice and wheat in past in that process govt exploited or made farmers exploit water of punjab level that soon punjab will be without drinking water if current system continues with new laws govt absolves itself completely from responsibility of making farming sustainable partly because current govt incapable of governance and partly because current govt ruined revenue structure badly with demonetization and flawed gst now govt wants private corporations make decisions for benefit of farmers and this most laughable solution offered by govt for benefit of farmers
can someone please tell me why 90 of indian farmers were not protesting
start boycotting godi media channels zee news republic bharat india tv and news 18

serves all farmers right now they can peacefully be dependent at mercy of government subsidies and complain for next few decades that farmers ignored and no steps improve their condition excellent game plan by farmer unions
2 consultation with farmers
bjp blind with arrogance yogi has messed up yogi should resign
2 but if trade happens through state apmc mandis then there various charges for example commission agents arhatiyas get 2 5 state govt imposes mandi charges and cess which gives them revenue but all these charges get built in price and ultimately 135 crore consumers suffer in terms of higher prices so if trade move out of these apmc mandis till 5th june no one was allowed trade outside apmc then who at loss
very good initiative big media houses rarely showing this protest very proud of farmers conviction
zee news bas bjp news dekhata
shekhar gupta ji your explanation was very good please join govt policy makers group and explain farmers directly instead of union agri minister
farmers always nature lovers and peaceful people they strong enough discuss why will they protest then especially when 80 percentage of india farmers
for modi nothing above election
these protests have fizzled out these farmers cant tell what wrong with laws except that they want new laws back these protests by vested interests and only around delhi by punjabi and up rich landlords there no such protests in west east or south india
guru will help farmers
punjab haryana and western up has strong farmers lobby whenever we talk about farmer protest its them only so when did see farmer of odisha ever protesting instead of questioning intention of farmer ask this autocratic government please maintain your impartial face dont become part of godi media
if protection concrete and gives absolute protection favor farmers then i will be very happy because anyway companies will have do their trade and balance so if they into small trading business they will have get through for survival in market this where very big companies like reliance wallmart come because they could beat any market including mandi because could be initially buying goods at best price monopoly and crash all big players dept and then sell and buy produce at price wishes later on future
we with farmers jai kisan
india support u becz farmiate spine of mother india
stand with farmers of india
godi media why dont u identfy who was that man and show one program in his name rss gundas
wow put all blame on farmers could not even apologize properly
no compromise government must repeal three laws fortunately majority of country support cause of india farmers unfortunately there no unifying gandhi like figure who can lead protest and turn all people against government and force its hand so farmers will have prolong struggle
but im sorry say that with regard this video as misinformed as our indian farmers law will only help them earn more major advantage for farmers that farmers loosing 12 of revenue by selling their farm produces in mandis they also not allowed sell their produces outside mandis government here change that
call panjabi farmers actually they landlords and poor from bihar do farming there
justification of exploitation of brutal force today should not be done by some separate incidents which have place in past actions necessary which can differ from situation situation firstly they can try talk delegation of farmers if situation worsens they can warn them and use water cannons and tearing gas as primary active resistance if situation worsens further police can start lathi charge administration should be more mindful of its actions
do think only punjab farmers has challenge of price in open market what ever challenges has raised true all farmers across india therefore need change current system and hence new policy
political analyst should be neutral why supporting bjp
disappointing that reformist law have been repealed hope this implemented in at least bjp ruled states
good old days month back when barricades was open and police was eating food from farmers protest now like international boarder
why not said about mask in bjp election
these people most educated in india i have never seen these things by any political party after rally they only give slogan of swach bharat
may allah protect all farmers i pray for brothers
until i saw this video clarifying farm laws i was totally confused as what this ruckus about thanks amit uve put in perspective but word selling for profit not very apt can anyone sell his her product at less than or same price at which they have bought or spent produce doesnt farmer producer add his margin and sell selling at extraordinarily high margin called profiteering which essential commodities act supposed control but selling at profit what makes business engine run at every stage of its transfer of ownership
for sake of farmers now important that devise political strategy for your campaign
thanks bro for supporting farmers
humble request farmers please behave your anger before taking any action please do pray bhagat singh and waheguruji and then action but not with weapons or anger

why farmers from south india not protesting against these bills
now facsist bjp government know about strength of farmers
what about farmers in rest of states government should divide procurement according state population and distance from source we get substandard rice and wheat in kerala if minimum support price procurement used in andhrapradesh or tamilnadu properly we could eat something that comes through public distribution not even chicken eats rise from public distribution monopoly should be stopped
south indian like other country modi we did not get any benefits
bro major respect u for making videos on farmers millions of people hear respect bro
state government punjab congress have tax in agriculture collect from punjab dhaan mandi because of new rules and law former can sell his foods any market that all so state government losse tax collection fund not modi government fault totally by congress and by outsource country like china they funded such change into protest and make image in political issue nothing related from farmers issue maharashtra and other state already run this new law they have no problem with this new law because already law applied if more details then read about properly
i think bills were good contract farming will help person like me who doing job in delhi despite having farming lands
make every drop of blood of my dear farmers who laid down their lives let not their supreme sacrifice go in vain with elections on january in up government has once again gone fast forward act as great one
they no farmers
i just could not understand reasons for farmers getting upset about these laws there lots of emotions but lacks logics
whatever saying could be good bad or political but my question for mr kejriwal why didnt stand with students of jamie with saheen bang with caa protesters and supported removal of article 370 and on other side always ask full statehood power of delhi
not kisan who give their work on contract u p labour instead of doing work himself u p labour real kisanon now who do not work contractor
not one farmers from other states protesting
interesting informative video well done but at one point how tactfully mentioned and therefore commented on opposition stand on this bills u mentioned their name congress and didnt mention ruling party name anywhere this itself shows your biases at least where lean this argument that at one point they wanted get same bill questionable same draft of bill see i am not saying they were perfect but i hope understand what opposition can do or should be doing and they largest opposition we have guys also tactfully didnt mention why these protests prolonged only reason govt not ready listen and amend bills hence protest but somewhere i feel know this and decided not talk about anyways as said in loud noise tend not hear your own voice i appreciate if dont use this tactic
few handful hooligans have hostage interest of small farmers
there should be ctc on how many private brands procure from apmc above msp or at msp looks like new laws would only legitimize procurement below msp how then farmer friendly
this bill not about farmer but hits middleman who leaches in our system and have very powerful lobby and opposition party supports
i just want thank sir for not being bias and bringing truth for viewer like as i was looking for this info on so many platform and everywhere i found out that either i have be bjp or congress supporter listen their one sided argument and i cannot tolerate either of
we farmer not terrorists
this time modi messed with wrong people punjabis and haryanvis
this indeed shashtanga namaskar by modi that was totally uncalled for this just political expediency masquerading as national interest coming as does now and not on january 26th when our tricolor was abused at redfort if anti nationals and anti social elements trying hijack farmer protest solution tackle head on with all might of nation india so powerless that cannot enforce what was passed in parliament or spinelessness of modi government that has always allowed issues go out of hand shahin bagh nrc caa land reforms rather than nip in bud by addressing with proper articulation and dissemination of its programs modi letting down people who placed their trust and hope in voting bjp with huge mandate cannot now expect repeat of unless shows some mettle in walking talk
yogendra yadav ex mp having crores of property leading this rally or misleading poor farmers last time one of leader triggered riots in delhi curb his personal enemity now this guy and way happens in delhi under rule proof of something fishy
farmers talvaar maar upload video of explaining about what happened on rday 2021 if have guts
190 countries speaking against haryana government who did not allowed farmers go delhi supreme court has also said farmers have rights do peaceful protest so farmers doing peaceful protest should go meet farmers
i dont think loss of election in west bengal or possible loss in punjab or anywhere in country real reason for withdrawal of farm laws
modi brought farm laws help farmers then shelved reasons knows best does that mean farmers need stop using best practices of selling private players and run back middlemen no instead of berating modi make list of items that were beneficial and ask cm of individual states implement them using local laws that only way silent majority will get their due
agri reforms but jese implement wese nhi 6 din me bada reforms nhi pehele farmers agricultural economist and agricultural experts baat reforms lao fir parliament me pass tarika
2 why that only farmers from punjab protesting against bill because bill does away with taxes which were levied if produce was sold outside of apmc mandi
please share pdf link of farm bill 2020
do not mention why government has not been able solve problem of farmers for so long
hard believe after assembly election they may place bill again by way electoral bond friends have compensate this way or that way
analysis by mr iyer not that correct regarding that there will be disturbance in punjab modi has lot of intelligence inputs than master
please make new video in current situation in indian farmers
i stand with modi i dont care about others i just listen modi ji
farmers should sell their grains public directly either physically or even online only if they get their rate which should be twice msp all problem will be solved
indians plz unite against this tyrant government
since start of protest more than 150 farmers died
jaana patha protests tho farmers favour hi good decision they will suffer and make all suffer
i do not think any user in comment box uses bsnl sim or travel in air india flight whatever products they using in personal life comes from so called corporates and cost reasonable because of fair competition but some ppl creating havoc against corporates
congress and just manipulating farmers threatening them they will become servants which not true msp can never go farmers will prosper they need understand frankly govt does not have guts do anything wrong with punjab in particular we punjabis always ready fight and govt fears losses india would loose lot money without punjab of all punjab dearest
same thing they have done for abrogation of 370 section modi government servant should be dealt with by all farmers singly
if indian governments increased price for crops increases disposable income with in country as all ready tiger economy and has ever more affluent population that could afford this would turbo charge its economy

unfortunately bbc reporter missed out key reasons for withdrawing farmer laws yes there political mileage of this turn but more importantly confusions among farmers and misused by other political parties
farmers produce grains that politicians eat every day
3 tomato onion and other vegetable prices less than inr 5 kg in our village on same day will be more than inr 50 in delhi sometimes farmers not even harvesting their products avoid losses labor cost harvest higher than selling cost
delhi police puncturing tyres they culprits then they label farmers as terrorists wah india
very bad day for india bjp right
as ex army officer i would like compliment police forces involved in this shameful affair i salute your perseverance patience and dedication duty was sheer discipline and leadership that did not open fire i compliment men and officers of police force i compliment governments masterstroke in allowing these mobs vandalize city this brazen display of crude hooliganism in media glare has ensured that this movement over i also invite so called better trained police of west in wake of death of george floyd view restraint of indian police in much more challenging situations
watch study iq dristi ias videos regarding farm bills this video grossly portrayed one side against government and farmer and for side of middlemen
so kids this how bend ego of magelomaniac dictator by sacrificing lives in cold hot rainy weather taking abuse by literal walking trolls having called names terrorists khalistanis but still persistently fighting against all odds against authority that what shaheed bhagat singh did years ago will be proud like all india including sanghis secretly proud of happy guru purab
directly shows how fragile indian farming industry and government cannot always pouring cash into these holy cows this reality now days indian farmers have become more of burden and liability on government budget rather than supporting
and government should give msp assurance i know its not that simple then these whole bills will become really beneficial for farmers and farmers will be directly connected market and middleman role will get removed
farmers havent even read rules they just come out protestors
if good what prevented govt from taking farmer community into confidence before passing bill deviating parliamentary democracy matter people of this country no more trust him because has done many blunders like demonization gst abrupt lockdown and people also know his reforms means first pushing nationally important industries distress and then handing over his financers from gujarat
election h lie repeal or wajah nhi h
very sad reforms were needed vested interests have unfortunately won i wish farmers could have understood that these laws were important for them only

one lousy state election which iyer mitra refers actually two in punjab there need support amarinder eliminate congress in one more state and gain ally in both houses of parliament in u p there need strengthen adityanath in long term interest of country because u p critical for 2024 and adityanath may be strong choice when modi retires at age 75 as seems likely other than that there khalistan agitation supported by pakistan and possibly china that raising ugly head none of these threats leave alone bankrupt opposition with no constructive propositions offer existed at time of manmohan singh so with all due respect i propose that iyer mita should hold his horses and think little more before using his considerable standing as journalist express opinions that may harm in long run
learn this lesson well see unity under one cause in tribalism that breeding with help of those who would divide when there comes time control tribes must give up their divergent resolutions and find cause for all their strength they will respect desire that able set in motion every heart what desire can unify divided find and make your rallying cry no farmers no food no me no

upper west up witness of new pakistan and khalistan muslim and sikh unity dangerous for india why hindu from outside avoid that area for business

also mandi tax worthwhile revenue for state governments like punjab gets no benefit like its immediate neighbours like j and himachal get where industries who set up shop in these states given tax holidays by central government and haryana has sez around ncr so more more industries go places like baddi in himachal where taxes by centre super low compared any industry being set up just across in punjab

make more video show whats happening at farmers protest because no one else showing same we have believe on youtube media
if good new agriculture system in india than why indian farmers angry modi govt
so more and more people will get know each and everything abouth these bills which godi media do not want know
first of all mandi system reason why our farmers have suffered all these years contract farming provides farmers with all necessary items required farmer receives high quality seeds from company moreover farmer can decide break contract at any given time even before these bills were passed pepsico had entered into agreements with several farmers in punjab no farmer had any problem with private contractor this new system provides farmers with wide range of market price regarding essential co modities bill initial act was brought in when country had deficiency of resources today thanks green revolution india produces more than sufficient requirement this bill was previously preventing companies from purchasing goods in excess from farmers store amendment changes that please do not spread fear among people like this
government should start massive communication excirse involving role plays by actors academics experts pr agencies etc at village level well covered in social media etc start from states like gujarat south india bihar orissa north east etc massive massive excercise creatively projecting benefits

like most punjabi hindus from pind my family does farming and we vote bjp more so than congress lately grandfather time period and beyond used be strong congress supporters no other choice my family active at local level in panchayat and also at protests political affiliation does not come before your livelihood and wellbeing of your people idea that only sikhs going protests all media propaganda sikh 57 of punjab rest hindu haryana also mostly hindu and 5 sikh protests overwhelmingly hindu but media will only show sikhs wearing dastar make rest of india buy into this otherism this not religious issue its livelihood issue only people who farmers and come from these families understand how going impact now and in future whether they hindu sikh muslim etc punjabi or haryanvi people in city will not understand and they have proved
who give permission rally our republic day modi government west
i always support farmers but this 60 days protest was conduct by brokers all state farmers already told about these brokers
2 apmc in punjab plays supporting role in procurement by fci does not procure foodgrains from farmers only provide space and facilities for procurement in punjab and haryana apmc well structured and well governed because of this farmers easily sell their produce fci without any problem e g unloading cleaning bagging and loading of foodgrains but this system not so developed in uttar pradesh farmers faces many procedure and steps sell their produce fci but not all farmers of up bears this lengthy process and most of them not even aware of government purchases so they sell their produce private players at very disappointed price

papu n kejruddin wanted use farmers protest win 2024 elections
reforms needed diversify crops increase income of farmers without increasing burden on consumers but there was nothing in these laws these economists should tell if possible without subsidies otherwise they should shut their mouths
not completely correct akash protesting does work but not if part of certain minority community farm leaders were not jailed those who spoke in their support were not jailed and charged with sedition look at what happened during caa protests had not been for covid many of them would have been killed or in jail leaders of anti caa movement in jail charged with sedition with no hope or discussion from liberals release them on bail there indeed two indias one for minorities and one for majority
why sikh brother always hate bjp why bro congress not do anything for hindu and sikhs
support farmers and chase those idiot politicians
truth india ungovernable from center there needs be delegation of as many powers states as possible so that some of more reform minded states like telangana tamil nad or gujarat can move ahead and leave laggards like punjab or kerala or up their fate if tamil nadu or gujarat was county by itself could in decade be high middle income country
80 of people in haryana and punjab aggressive

why non farming population should worry new laws will create massive unemployment and internal security problems above all corporations will become too big and too significant for any future govt do course correction not only in farming but in consumer market as well since these corporations will have end end monopoly in future govt primary function would be put out fires with army and paramilitary forces because neighboring countries will create internal security problems by exploiting frustrated and ignored sections of society foreign investment will not only cease but run out in such environment except aggressive exploiters like vedanta adani united fruits etc there will be two types of indians one living comfortably in tight security zones and one living miserably trying save their skin from these zaildars of east india company group

as much as state sponsored indian mainstream media tries ignore or defame this true people struggle potential takes across all borders and oceans thanks vice for covering this event as deserves every bit of attention
indians living all over world want justice for farmers what breaks my heart that pm modi has not once acknowledged agitation of farmers how can pm show such indifference how can ignore agitation going on for months its just unbelievable
i am not saying farm bills bad but given implementation record of our government as seen with gst demonetisation 370 etc i am not sure will benefit farmers more than corporates in near future besides govt not ready guarantee msp in writing these bills far better for big educated farmers who understand market law can read fine prints of comtracts like kerala than marginal ones who comprise almost 80 of farmers
there nothing like farmers protest few idiots want become neta thts all
really if market price rs 10 and contract was agreed upon rs 20 by this example can literally showcase that farmer will get benefit but what if marekt price turns into rs 30 and contract was on rs 20 in that case farmer ko loss ni this regarding example gave at 3 50 sec video time
with pm announcing repeal of said laws and certainly rattled kisan leadership but their purpose was not sovled which was harrass govt as well as oust bjp from power in up uttarakhand stop its chances if any in punjab
if really government wants work for farmers then should work on old bill loop poles i e traders license mafia culture should be stopped and so on and should not remove msp
government should not buckle down under any circumstances farm bill reforms
2 government has limited fixed allotted money buy produce from farmers at price fixed by government so rest produce purchased by middlemen at much lower price
imho mr modi should have addressed those sitting on dharna and explained root cause of bringing laws and how they benefit all imho made huge mistake by not addressing them timely repealing laws now harakiri for india
tragedy of our country that majority of city youth unaffected by ground realities of country supportfarmers
why did not cancel kishan bills
this not victory of indian farmers win of congress and co dallas
long before modi became prime minister india had already initiatives for chandrayan mangalyan gslv mono rail nuclear marine agni missile chetak mig arjun tank sukhoi dhanush etc
this indias margaret thatcher moments its times make farming sectors of india self reliant like others sectors
somehow i seriously cannot accept any negative comments on modi i think would had thought enough on each scenario way they tackled 370 abrogation nothing when compared with farm bill
these very small portion of farmers in which u can see alot of khalistani and shaaheen bagh muslims clearly politically motivated
all of our other sectors have negative growth so we cannot shift farmers any other sectors in these uncertain times when people already losing jobs and our economy shit thanks modi
every citizen must wake up now otherwise its going b too late farmers r going survive with these draconian laws but other public not farmers have land they can easily grow there own food but when there no mandi no roadside shop no rehdi then u all have go adanis mall like farm pic then they r going charge 1000 rs kg for sabji like gobhi louki etc whoever doesnt believe this can go ambani adanis mall check there price its happening now when u have rehdi road side shops imagine when all these going shut down couple of more laws coming in next session where farmers need special permit from center govt pollution board sell even 1 liter milk
quality of produce will be improved in msp mechanism there no differentiation in quality while procurement this made farmers not bother about quality they forced grow high yielding mediocre quality rice and wheat
so excited when government humiliated thx farmer
we what economists would call low trust society farmers protest largely trust issue people do not trust central gvt have their back due policy debacles in past so now that they have come with beneficial scheme they not appreciated for

i think quick and potentially winning gambit for modi govt would be declare that farm laws would not be comp lsorily thrust on states would be upto states decision on their implementation thereby not only shifting focus away from central govt but also paving way for some states lead way by implementing laws and reap benefits leaving others behind forcing latter mend their ways when entire farm protests led by narrow fringe belonging only 2 states such outcome could easily be envisaged
support for farmers from kashmir
indian farmers treated well by bjp and co
breaking skull of farmers like break skull of your father who toils for people watching
why indian govt not taking strict action against owaisi
if after all these things some people still support modi govt then i do not really think these guys will ever understand they just too deaf and blinded by toxicity andhbhakt for reason
listen intellectuals listen economists repealing of farm laws would only benefit big farmers and arhatiyas small farmers and consumers need farm laws like these this bad news people celebrating as they got lollipop back and will not have eat spinach anymore
6 food security undermined right now our buffer stocks 90 million tonnes of food grains while we need only 41 million tonnes of food grains therefore we already food surplus we now producing 1 75 kg food grains per capita per day while we need hardly 1 2 kg 500 gms of food per capita per day in addition our nominal protection coefficient on average 0 87 indicating that we can export and earn 13 percent higher price abroad therefore all 3 laws useful for farmers there may be need for some small changes such as approaching civil court for dispute resolution and these may be accommodated else entire act in its entirety helpful farmers
mrmodi exactly knows why withdrew farm laws
consumers benefit because large organized retailers directly procure from farmers eliminating middle men this will reduce 20 30 costs at consumer level

well above all i would like draw parallel here however irrelevant may sound but i think way forward remember when we speak about removing brahminical hegemony from society we praise burning of manusmriti in public which does not mean every letter word written over there cannot be morally co opted in modern age but because has resulted in hegemonic tool for particular class opress many others by controlling narrative run accordingly that why what ambedkar did most logical indians today find necessary behind him
they give more empowerment farmers without taking away anything from them
i would have loved find out how this impacts other farmers not just from north indian states for example in my hometown farmers sell coconuts co operative societies and they get paid around rs 10 per coconut while sold for rs 35 each here in cities pricing even worse for vegetables all of this while they plagued with issues like no labour no water floods obviously i cannot rely on regional media right now because we having our own drugs mafia episodes going around cover up whatever that happening here
irresponsible godi media its news papers may be boycott too by all kissan families

in west bengal apmc act not followed strictly number of mandis also very less one has travel long distances sell product in mandi market price much less compared minimum support price most of farmers forced sell products at less prices company agriculture also very common in west bengal many companies went our area and offered farmers higher prices and told them that they will buy all products however condition have buy everything like fertilizer etc from them they will sell these fertilizers at very high prices almost four or five times of market cost eventually what happens cost of farming rises and farmers started suffer sometimes even companies also do not want all products showing quality issues eventually farmers will suffer losses after suffering these kinds of losses in our area farmers stoped doing these kinds of agriculture
these r our educated and well informative farmers

lol good work in making video guess there certain points in bill which definitely need amendment matches with points raised by makes things bit more clear why needs amendment there must be some msp as legal right whenever they opening up markets very valid point stop corporate monopoly how much that msp must be debatable can be lower than current msp but there must be legal implemented msp otherwise there can definitely be monopoly am always supporter for this govt but in this case needs act quickly and resolve matter soon instead of any delay resulting in loss for votes
other than haryana punjab kissan why not other states kissan protesting
nowadays modiji speeches less about reforms and development and more of criticism towards other political parties
police will be in place of farmers tomorrow support farmers now join your brothers
rihanna did well thank indian sale braties were in great sleep supreme court also working for government media personnel who showing truth got detained under serious act of law

directed police force throw water cannon over farmers in extremely chilled weather from this episode people can understand what despicable creature narendra modi should be booted out of power forever and for passing farm bill in undemocratic manner
we stand with farmer
farmers lost
love all farmers from pakistan
in my city every wednesday farmers directly sell their products at comparatively lower price perhaps if bill successfully implemented there fair possibility that uniformity in price of commodities will be hampered ofcourse consumers will go for lower prices and this will probably add fury of middlemen if at all involved
do not expect u people will come in his place that modi did any p till today get respect like our p modi ji do not think b j p will loose they will win with more number of seats priyanka gandhi do not expect ur family will again india again in ur hands
non cooperation movement was called off by mahatma gandhi after chauri chaura incident will congress call off their support this protest now
hahahahaah we wonder how india america and nato failed in afghanistan and now blaming pakistan weird what were they doing there that they cannot even control area with that might india should send forces in afghanistan because regional military might qnd teach lesson pakistan
this not full picture fundamentals of new laws seem benifit farmers more than not
hats off formers they warriors bjp allowing india moving towards capitalism this not good for country
i usually do not dislike ndtv videos but title just showing they somewhat biased if bjp minister does something bad they clearly write bjp minister but when congress ministers relative involved they just wrote minister just be clear i do not like bjp just thing i noticed
i am so surprised that talking about lending money by these middlemen artis on personal basis there no legal framework support farmers and in fact could task corporations support minimum viable price and not extort farmers speaking one sided though i understand market pressure will come in force and drive prices based on demand and supply but this does not mean msp and mandi viable options imagine this kind of price control exist in other commodities does not support economics or farmers developed nations dont have this system and done away with and indian farmers receive lot of perks those having vested interest support out of greed hope farmers understand long term benefits concerns can be addressed when corporations invest in sector and contracts could be mutually inclusive
creates doubt in people mind about farmer protest
farmers proud of at least some one has guts fight against dictator gunda modi and bjp we support farmers
without farmers no one can survive so they have right since they back bond of nation

excellent work from farmers

so modiji inculcated these bills just scrap apmc and benefit private market and one does not needs any divyadrishti know who will be that private market only ambani and adani
i from pakistan but i support your content because talking about right of people
regarding farm produce will definitely follow commodity cycle of wild upswings and downswings we can see how much price of onion fluctuate every single year in fact many customers like my mother use their benefit by building up inventory at lower prices naive farmers will sadly suffer whether at hands of corporate or middlemen politicians as usual will act for their own benefit
modi should resign for not repealing 3 black laws in time what shameful coincidence or political engineering as black laws repealed as sikhs celebrate birth of guru nanak devji founder of sikhism sweet venom
when there not any other agenda for politics left now bjp members using agenda of taliban at least this agenda will work for some time
bring any reforms in india process of educating farmers paramount i do believe that mr modi always thinks in favour of masses and in this case how make farming very competitive with bigger returns there no doubt reforms in farming needed india new levels however farmers concern were that measures of reforms would benefit corporates and corporates would dictate their terms farmers this aspect made them extremely uncomfortable
sir i really liked your arguments very well articulated financial and economical side of these bills seem good but first actually producing different crops and diversifying production not easy expensive which why having msp provides assurance farmers as they dont get paid every month like everyone who works in some kind of professional field bill not bad but shouldnt govt build infrastructure first that will provide farmers with assurances like increasing prices of other crops and guaranteeing minimum support price
appeals strengthing farmers unity kisan zindabad
over 95 percentage of tractors owned by rich farmers nsso report
joint committee of farmers and govt will finalize law clauses that will benefit farmers or not but unions adamant
east india company built roads railways courts police stations schools and colleges but we kicked them out because they never listen public for them company profit was more important than public will hint modi thinks son of queen elizabeth
i also read about laws i do not find anything wrong for my farmer brothers however there journalists like ravish kumar who used command some respect among intellectuals they also behaving foolish seriously worrying trend
i feel sorry for my country modi ji we with
these farm laws would have been easily repealed and new reforms could have been done if our media system did their job honestly serve citizens not government
pm modi has admitted lack of his government efforts make farmers understand about laws and their benefits
i am son of farmer feels proud
boycott ambani adani and modi if india wants stay independent
bad worst its all over for agricultural reforms tikait decoit won anna hazare moment for modi government
this so called activist anna have never thought of andhra farmers who protesting since 2 years but supporting market agents shame on u anna who never supported andhra farmers
we all going starve for doing such thing farmer and accepting such injustice
missed larger point which made govt sit think over at recent inauguration of expressway by pm lot of up buses were deployed bring people from villages show pm still popular but all those buses returned inaugural site practically empty pm show was damp squib this was also one of reasons trigger withdrawal of farm laws govt knew took panga with wrong people sikhs maybe minority but they resilient warriors who can show people their place govt knew even after doctored opinion polls show bjp govt still popular contrary ground reality likely lose up elections
brokers won and stopped progress of farmers
traditional farmer
yogendra yadav ji your support and work for kishan andolon will be remembered forever in future

sp mim etc hypocrites for whom nation comes last up citizens should realise this and support yogi ji who stands for nationalism and development this tikait fellow dark spot amongst poor innocent farmers bjp did blunder by not demolishing him and allowing him be demon
now how this so called farmer netta asked modi double farmers income
sorry not protesting farmer correct protesting sikhs
according my knowledge similar concept present in where farmers can sell there production any one but failed because business men naturally profit makers and reason farmers surviving there incentive they get from government continue agriculture as know farmers there much more educated than indian counterparts and fact that they still being exploited justifies fear of indian farmers
jai jawan jai kisan modi tapasya formula water cannons wire barricades stopping water supply false cases calling farmers as terrorists agents of china pakistan etc if this formula of tapasya then guess mindset of nikamma leader
modi has not come power only with help of urban middle class farmers have big part in bringing him back in power
farmers should not retaliate with violence please make silent protest
supreme court lost his credibility no one listening farmers bjp gundagardi sehan
7 30 poor small farmers have borrow money average land holding in punjab 3 62 hectares compared 1 08 hectares nationally three times national average yes poor small farmers indeed system must be improved for farmers realize more financial gain your argument should be access of better funds and credit farmers arhtiya not only way do that and that not good enough reason them around
why people saying that these reforms were passed without any consultations these farm bills were pending since upa government in 2013
shekhar sir with all respect your way of journalism i think clearly missing larger picture its not about fact that msp will remain or not or whether existing system has lot of flaws which everyone knows yes has i think its more about securitising poor farmers of our country agriculture heavy economy which way more than few percent of rich farmers i think when discuss such huge bills should compare with other nations who have gone with route of corporatisation or what they call free market theory every country different would have been great if could have added section of what we can learn from west economies who have already done that there no country in west were farmer suicides have decreased in fact has only increase whether its america spain etc for country like india which now pushed back more poverty and hunger will this be good move now i think problem not intent of policy but why cannot there be any small case study prove this works for country like small state first see if this will work before implementing all over india and why cannot government do that first before shoving bill through without consultation and flawed voice votes we all know performance of this government when comes implementing policies into action for country like india which already has so many farmer suicides i personally feel our country needs find right balance between policies of socialism and free market
as indian i was supporting them till yesterday as they were protesting without violence later on seeing all these today in media i neither consider them as protesters nor farmers i even now feel shame tell them as indians after what they did in red fort and how they attacking police and mainstream media
now poor farmers will suffer again if crops gets destroyed by calamity then burden will again fall on tax payers and moreover bjp has given hope and shown peacefuls way that if they protest enough caa can also be repealed if they put enough pressure on government
these laws were so good for indian economy and farmers but these paid goons won only rich farmers with vast land and with political connections won that will middlemen bribe culture alive same happened on nrc caa same happened with this law

analysis one sided new bills only provide for additional opportunities for farmers this in no way removes obliterates apmcs apmcs till today had no competition because farmers were forced sell there and traders in apmcs could cartelise against farmers when consumer purchase from any shop that wishes why not make available same benefit farmer decision for farmers on where sell apmcs may sensing competition offer them better rate and hence may have chance improve their relevance currently farmers get about 30 of value paid by consumer if same at 50 farmers income would go up more than 100 considering inputs and other costs apmc act modification and removal of restrictions have been earlier pushed by congress government also in fact most of states have adopted major apmc reforms in fact states like kerala have no apmc and there farmers get relatively better returns for their produce as compared other states about 50 of value paid by consumer also congress manifesto of 2019 specifically mentions removal of apmc restrictions this current drama only poltically motivated better returns for farmers without disturbing price paid by consumer can only happen by bringing about efficiency and transparency in market mechanism in any case this only additional opportunity for farmers which upto farmer decision on whether make use of or not

because apmc mandi infrastructure mostly in northern india where punjab has 1 access mando 125 sq km in other can range upto 1500 km per mandi so these farmers in those states do not have access mandi and they sell in private mandis then which what gov wants so they not affected
farm laws will help farmers make more profit ryt will eliminate middle men and their pricing system then why farmers protest by doing this farmers will remain poor

all farmers had was speculative fear communist implanted psyche still persists in country that does not let good things happen many happy that farmer won modis arrogance decimated but these regressive attitudes hurting nation repeal taking country backward and do not feel bjp will let other parties pass these bills if they happen be opposition in future in end nation suffers
even big corporates can form cartel and eventually monopoly so removing apmc would further detoriate farmer conditions
farmer wants toilet not gun and glory
people saying that these were for betterment of farmers i just have one question if they have studied little bit of polity what was need of passing these 3 laws through ordinance if there was no malafide intentions
without farmers there no life on earth plz respect them
lol india has always been in this case that they do not give others dues pakistan stands firmly with our sikh brothers there and muslims in kashmir they have been suffering with radical modi and hindus
being farmer myself i do not support government on this bill i have sold my wheat produce on msp as well as private players claim by government that farmer prior this bill could not sell private player total lie in fact i always had option bargain better with private purchaser due msp this will gradually push me look at other crops than wheat and rice if all farmers slowly start shifting from staple crops then price bound increase
vote for correct party or independents who respects farmers and treat every section equally

this bill had many advantages farmers with direct intervention of private players will reduce chance of wastage of crop grown this will improve technology investment in farming that reduces burden for farming and many advantages india has myth stating farmers uneducated innocent but in reality present generation not like that instead of saying private players can loot farmers let educate farmers
bill seeksamendmenttoessential commodities act 1955which was introduced in 1955 when india wasnot self sufficientin food production there wasfood scarcity limits were enforced checkhoardingandprice riseofessential commodities
if farmer have issues and doubts for bills government need talk them and clear doubts most important thing why government supporting privatization
even after giving law on msp and abrogating 3 farm laws tikait will not stop protest because if protest stopped who will know that rakesh tikait exist

i am proud subscriber of this channel but this analysis looked naive me sir like being mouthpiece of govt policies here what practical aspects of corporates of india so dudh dhula in beginning they will invest in going villages and procuring crops from them at cheaper price this way mandis will simply go out of business and then corporates will do what they best at exploitation this not same as liberalisation of economy for industries these farmers we talking about most states do not have apmc there corporates already exploiting farmers eg in gujarat farmers of pubjab haryana visibly better off financially than other states this also why so many rw trolls taking dig on their attire their tractors etc this makes me think have apmc really ruined them ofcourse there corruption in apmc but government should invest in removing corruption from and helping set up mandis in all states i not saying this going happen but these genuine fears of farmers who protesting now least that government could do in face of farmer protests not bring in army on roads and call khalistani movement and not bypass rajya sabha voting while passing law instead they should have deliberated dialogue with farmer leaders themselves and address their concerns and this should have been done 2 months back already

which amounts crores of rs being collected by apmcs all these going into pockets of ministers and officials with zero development eg if each processing units turn over approx 50 cr in year 50 lakhs goes apmc like that there will be more than 1000 processing units for particular food commodity open secret no need for any proof also now this commission need not be paid according this bill that why mlas and mps of punjab and haryana fighting that they will loose their share of money its been more than 20 30 yrs that yeswantapur apmc yard has been constructed even now that yard stinks and water enters stores when rains heavily other apmcs yards across india will be even worser when comes msp pricing govn has not scrapped that since apmcs still functional according this bill so farmers can still get their msp when trade fluctuation happen if so situation framers of maharashtra tamil nadu karnataka mp up bihar jharkhand not fighting when law was implemented in recent days that many states getting involved people should have also fought against nmc bill for destroying health sector by reducing quality of doctors by mixing process only doctor community came for support rest people not bothered only demonetization high price spiking petrol diesel this just my opinion not hurt anyone feelings
farmers may have some genuine concerns but these bill have been discussed over 17 years

unfortunately our ias officials and some political leaders also who prepare such attractive blueprints of so called reform bills have no idea of poverty lack of resources want of education want of computer internet technology lack of logistics paper documents works with our indian farmers therefore our indian farmers unlike american farmers not at requisite threshold of managing marketing of their produce by themselves inevitably under circumstances our agro marketting successful as totally dependent on our govt agencies existing system of mandikaran however in implemnting so called new reform bills would be distrous as will open all possible corrupt avenues for private traders middlemenn with all wealth perhaps even black money at their disposal who will rob farmers and thereby kill nation because today govt able have full control on procurement of produce and storage of surplus produce and its regulated distribution across needy population of country as well as regulating exports and even free donation needy world therefore in india unlike america as example discussed above in here with these new so called reform bills of management of agro produce definitely aimed at welcoming private middlemen traders buy and sell produce which would definitely rob deprive farmers of profits and that would kill nation as well because our nation india bharat comprised of smaller land holdings but by huge population of small farmers who do not have requisite threshhold enable them act become private businessmen in managing marketting their produce without middlemen either govt agencies or private traders our agro marketting surviving because of intensive infrastructure of procurement storage distribution in place with setting of price by govt farmers feel secure with govt agencies in marketing aspects of their produce while in case of private traders no one could secure our huge populace of small farmers with smaller holdings and small produce at respective individual farmer level only god will save poor farmer and poor india as for as gdp concerned if major population of nation farmers robbed then forget about gdp growth curves called reform system system will be robbed by middlemenn instead i may be allowed reemphasize repetition of paragraph above in here

farmers of india dying but modi govt not listening them from last 4 5 months
hey trevor i really appreciate way bring news people being indian living in right now i still am unclear about reforms as everywhere only told that private sectors gain while farmers lose which i would stand strongly against if case be that but what i am curious about proposed reforms in detail because more than often in india and countries alike protesters given piece of information that claimed be legitimate while government and protesters never face off as injectors of agenda ensure that there always barrier between them so protests go on for as long as possible that protest against i d love hear more detailed explanation of this from so that everyone knows what really and acts accordingly
british were ones bring in laws that gave farmers equal ground as most farmers were poor india taking right away british realized business men of upper caste that bought grains rice etc from farmers were exploiting them ie weights used measure grain etc were adjusted give advantage business buying grain products grain cost bring product business was at cost of farmer if grain was avg quality would be bought at lower price but sold at regular price any other expences like putting grain in packages was at cost of farmer business man was educated where farmer was not india ruled by upper caste brahmins they follow laws of manu laws of manu slavery laws in which caste laws and laws for women written along with punishments
not any agrement or deal possible with farmers if land tenure laws change they could become state managers of farming or consultants no understand

nice coverage shows how well planned and equipped protest wish people could focus on making farmers life better than just protesting against govt blindly
essentially farm laws were aimed at sterilizing their former partner akali dal in guise of bringing farmer reforms across country whereas majority of farmers across country were not visible in protest this was all about gaining control in punjab and haryana which went horribly wrong

corporates will enslave farmers farmers deserve their independence and power for crop their grow
kudos brilliantly explained i just have some questions around msp not making msp legal mandate affect quality of produce should not there be some benchmark around quality as well as kind of crop being produced should farmer producing substandard produce or crop which abundant in supply in market be also allowed avail msp or do we introduce msp on only some crops which we foresee as needed more during next 2 3 years keeping certain qualitative standards in place for crops reviewing msp becomes yearly or two yearly process for govt

next time farmers should not come and say their incomes not increasing and risk of farming on your own and commit suicide on failure all best farmers
therefore india was powerful nation with robust economy before modi gov

all farmers who doing these protests need see this video
why farmers still committed suicides before laws
never expected modi do appeasement politics more than 800 million people standing behind him as rock still going round and round on his issues poor judgment by modi should understand if we want appriciate gandhian ideology or balancing act politics we would have goven vote congress instead bjp

very good explanation on farm bills by mr gupta
3rd law suppose these companies will start storing these corps for 2 3 years and after 2 3 years they have enough stock and these companies refused buy corps from famers because they have more than enough stock and that time farmer will not have any options how will pay loan which took for cultivation and for harvesting and that time these companies will took advantage of these poor farmers and will tell them we can only buy your corps at half price because we already have enough stock and no place store so at that time farmers will have only two option 1st one sell corps at half price or 2nd one commit suicide because of loan

in 2008 farmers were protesting against government that time they were saying they dont have open marketbut now
let small farmers suffer who cares
but reality they not protesting for msp they want scrap all three laws fully so farmers dont get freedom sell anywhere else

rakesh ji great farmers proud of god bless anjum ji thank also for continuous coverage
slowly i am starting hate these farmers
solution this problem lies in increasing more more control of farmer over market chain of middlemen from farmer consumer or cutting
sikhs dalits muslims christians should all be one against rss modi then have better chance 1 of getting something out of this kissan protests unity against rss modi best free kalistan
certainly this farmers victory against ravans bjp believed that they can annul strike by some means and time they realized that their arrogance will wash out bjp we indebted farmers who bore wrath
ok these machines will be transported pakistan soon and we will deploy on indian border
i some how feel that this bill and protest against kind of blessing in disguise for youth of punjab will give them direction and better use of their energies will bring them back their original n will strengthen their link with their culture look effects on music

kejriwal ji very good in supporting speculations that farmers will be worse of in future same as with caa etc please think about delhi public by supporting kissan protest getting out of hand their some leaders misleading farmers and will create war like situation
what this fellow explains not correct his explanation biased in bill there no proposal remove msp this information said wrong also mandies and agriculture marketing societies controlled by middle men they control prices of commodities also some of these middle men very rich farmers especially in maharashtra up punjab rajasthan etc by this bill actually farmers benefited that reason real farmers there no objection middle men or brokers affected they instigate farmers for agitation by misguiding them

why bjp government so very stubborn listen farmers where your democracy your so proud of
eating and growing in india but why for against country then speaks that all we mean your parents from harami countries time waiting come real path
only people with brahmanical mindset will oppose farmers farmers epitomise hardwork
views expressed in this video similar those of urban naxalite views government has repeatedly clarified that old system will remain in full force in whatever system farmer gets profit sell his produce only in that system now farmer will be freed from clutches of brokers
can u tell modi just implement renowned agriculturist prof swami nathan commission report and action plan instead of stupid farm bills i e make current system work in efficient manner instead of privatising
this heart breaking but what if same people would have stood against terrorist and terrorism at least their kids would have survived and lived peacefully in future
modi responsible for this chaos fir should be filled against him also
congress party not at all bothered about either our country or welfare of people their only motive politics whatever bjp does uplift country congress only wants oppose because they want spoil image of bjp for next election those who support congress also equally responsible
why did they wait for 600 700 farmers die
due dirty politics bill repealed
this has led many farmers grow only rice and wheat in rotation as only thede two crops give guranteed income and that had led severe drop in nurtrient content of soil and underground water table especially as rice water intensive crop many environmentalist belive that this farming practice leading desertification of punjab including johl who agricultural econimist
i think farm bill good for farmers

need apologise modi ji some section of farmers were not worthy we with
sorry but modiji getting soft day day
can someone give copy of agreements between kisaan leader and government before tractor march on 26 jan 2021
bjp instigated violence delhi police also under home minister later they will blame khalustan khalistan has raised its had nothing like before than in rule of bjp2 before nobody even knew what was khalistan maybe its time now we should ask home minster itself who khalistan after 26 january violence if bjp does not arrest these leaders then means that bjp hand in gloves in instigating this violence
current situation like we have descended behind times when our country was under colonial rule our farmers had faced such typical situation and now our own elected government has placed democracy under guillotine
nakli kisan wow tehari got fresh installment from bjp
any honest ias officer would have proceed with law and order if farmers blocking highway and in turn might have triggered traffic jam in highway
rakesh tikait sahab real leader of india
they introduce bills in favour of industrialists like adani against whom already lot of opposition there in rajasthan due mines controversy and australia also and effect poor farmers but we dont speak as doesnt effect
jai jawan jai kisan if god with who can be against god greatest judge of all wait and watch good days ahead
this man have immense patience but this time seems be loosing as see condition of our farmers
just example of insurance companies even educated people these days cannot understand terms and conditions and end up in losing claim and getting fooled think of uneducated farmers how will they deal with this paperwork
on path of becoming godi media
definitely farmers need state subsidy our food security msp and roll of food corporation of india ensures minimum security for farmers and their products
farmers victim
forget about farmers beaware pis sfulls
big love nd support sikh brothers from pakistan
our farmer cannot understand which good and bad so everywhere need awareness by central government representative
farmers do not only live in punjab and haryana no one protesting in north east india or south india
we also cannot entirely blame america because true that one has fight for oneself fighting for another country not america responsibility but america cannot even run away from allegation that taliban was built by against ussr then after 9 11 invaded afghanistan in name of fight against terror america spent 80 billon dollars in providing military aid and support and more than 3 trillion in total in fight against terror
so easy for modi say on fine morning that repealing farm laws but modi needed one year understand this issue 700 lives have been lost make him realise this blunder because of his ruthless adamancy has been branded as icon of autocracy all over world adani and ambani must have felt frustrated
no farmers no food
would love hear from farmers as well in same respectful way media covering police side of story
unbaised only one flaw in new farmer bill have seen price hike in essential goods
hatsoff this explanation truly depicts pain of farmers those who envy punjabs wealth need understand wear and tear of its resources
previous farm laws having errors in them had be withdrawn be introduced amended in parliament and signed into laws again neither have tukde tukde gang nor khalistani separatists have been successful related this
only victory of commision agents and farmer politicians
why sikhs anti bjp was during congress time that golden temple was attacked not during bjp rule
god bless farmers
very well explained and i hope farmers learn about their rights get maximum benefits from these bills
shame on republic should show car running over innocent farmers republic biased
poor farmers got attached and tricked by them
congratulations our farmer community 95 of our farmers stood firmly for cause in path of non violence and patience hats off them
now our farmers will become prosperous again
have shown your pro congress tilt while i agree with on danger of sikh alienation i am at loss understand your silence on role of congress party particularly punjab govt have not criticized dangerous game they playing of course we did not expect from so called budhijibi who blind deeds of congress nobodies
i want tell indian government do not think that farmers alone all citizens indian army indian navy and entrine nri punjabi community stands with farmers shoulder shoulder
most of people think farmers only from punjab and haryanawhat about 95 of farmers from rest of indiasocialism has won not democracy
depsite firs there no arrests for bjp leaders ministers or their sons as demanded by farmers and opposition leaders reason behind this due majority of bjp leaders accused in criminal cases rapes and murders including cm yogi also accused in 20 year old murder case and even pm modi accused of behind brutal killing by lynching of ehsan jaffri congress mp in 2002 and case still going on in supreme court and next hearing against pm modi on 18th october 2021 therefore impossible for bjp govt arrest all of bjp leasers as almost all accused in so many cases that reason supreme court of india said jungle raj prevails in uttar pradesh in 2019 and also in madhya pradesh in 2021
correction apmc in different states regulated by respective sarkar of that particular states one of major concerns of farmers was fear of losing land big giants which was not discussed in video which in turn just fear with no grounds since contract farming as told in bills and in this video will only be done on produce and must not include binding of any kind on land of farmer i completely agree that these reforms seem be bit theoretical revolution but need of hour plug loopholes which giving farmers genuine concerns not force complete withdrawal of these bills i would not like talk about how bills were passed tho
itc makes partnership with farmers in same way and farmers too happy madhya pradesh gujarat rajasthan up areas itc focusing but those in singhu border making fake issues what do they get from this
change your headline not indian farmers punjab farmers
4 whole thing about personal relationship of middlemen and farmers strikes me as cultural thing in punjab and haryana maybe these state governments can continue support apmcs
farmers healthy because they do physical hard work and live in nature even if they contract covid they will not even get cough even old farmers will not die of covid
problem farmer seller in privatisation and starting point of trade again traders only get more profit in case of govt fci they do not have target for profit eventually will lead increase in retail price of produce and more profit private traders with more protection them because of litigations cannot be done with court solution cost of production should come down with increase of yield so that farmer should get 1 5 times cost without increase of cost
more than farm bills farmers cooperative societies do much better job example milk cooperatives farm bills reversal not such big deal
thanks bbc for making documentary for farmers in same time most of indian media became godi media
good news india farmers
since more acquired at mandis in punjab remember central government promise grain from up and or bihar also finds its ways into mandi system of punjab
this video fails explain role of middle man idea remove middle man also does not explain how much money farmer receives when sells apmc this new laws were enacted remove middle man bicholia three top middleman politicians
zee news and media showing only other part and asking kisan h those farmers only that tolerating all your political drama
tractor rally happening right now jai jawan jai kisan
ofcourse there will be some agressive farmers but there external elements aswell

same guy who went wto in 2018 and reported that india giving more msp farmers has no mean with this protest wants votes only
pm cabinet college whose portfolio includes police directly has son who by all that emerging now has deliberately run over farmers still holding on his post
contract farming this should not be only option contract companies monoculture reluctant invest back into farming communities rural interests standard commodities can be rejected payments farmers can be delayed
these godi media do not have guts question people in power shameless journalism
government got what they wanted put black mark on farmers protest

i want strong n undivided india modi g
zee news not media channel its bjp channel
expecting too much no one affected by political parties acting like farmers and protesting without any agenda
national embarassment shame on these so called farmers ca not even respect tiranga
was never about india and her farmers was was more about image pelf and power
farmers need support of true media
now if have completed reading above crap and have seen this highly informative video read about parliamentary committee reports research white papers on indian farming for last 10 15 years if not more know positives and risks of new law
we all should stand with farmers
farmers fearing that agriculture also has been privatised who great in this country people or people elect law makers if good and flawless why do need promotion what will voiceless people of this country do now
from what i have learnt with some agreed conditions these farming bills can do some good so why not debate on and clear this off most people from all sides just stupid
talked about positive side of capitalism farm bill 2020 profits etc etc but who talked about cons private players grouping cartel formation exploitation of farmer could be there buying their crops even lesser price than that of mandis removing msp on crops reduce budget deficit not solution there different tools present reduce that deficit
ask pakistan for aid they already gave afganistan taliban so why not way live
realfarmerssupportthebill
i with farmers
i love taliban jindabad love form bangladesh all media fak
totally we should throw bjp govt from all over country n we should elect good party in next election
nicely explained except for one thing that missed if pvt companies not paying farmer for what they have agreed on farmer shall get lower price said but in this case farmers can still sell product in mandi on msp missed
mistake of farmers only
this move can help bjp in upcoming assembly elections
ravish anti indian
wtf what happens farmers in states where they want new farm laws
indian backbone farmers and now govt trying break that
4 now on why mostly farmers of punjab n haryana protesting because these two states have best n functional mandi system in country n msp on many farm products in real sense for instance for one quintal of wheat in punjab farmers get around 1500 1600 where as same thing in bihar farmer have sell for 800 900 no wonder why farmers from mostly these two states protesting in india government have define msp on many food items but there no binding law support same nor implemented as every states have there own system now that one of demand of protesting farmer law on msp
1990 indias occupation army has martyred over 100 000 kashmiris widowed 22 000 women orphaned 108 000 children and raped more than 11 000 women i urged international community prosecute indian civil and military personnel for worst form of state terrorism and serious crimes against humanity in indian administered jammu and kashmir
me only educated farmers with small businesses niche development and sincere assistance provided through smb ministry only way how do educate these farmers maybe some cash in hand will help for starters like if they could be given money like cab drivers got from these companies but its strong maybe

whilst this critique looks at how free market could benefit farmer and i do not think this was made clear enough simply assumed based on western economic theory reality of different types farmers and farming practices as stands for india was not considered free market model has been in practice in west for long time but had not made western farmer better off furthermore biodiversity has suffered as has diversity and variety of foods that grown there much fewer farmers today than in past and fewer and fewer people willing continue farming there has been huge loose of heritage crops and therefore foods and therefore culture only winners of this model has been big corporations old or new model middle men inevitable so better have local middle men who can engage with directly than corporate global one who do not know nore care about nore have any channels engage with

i patiently heard whole video and each fact stated in correct and clear manner but i do not understand that what point where says how these laws will help farmers farmers in punjab and haryana not happy by growing paddy they do not have any other options instead of privatizing agriculture sector government should have started procuring more of other crops that india importing from outside if we can have surplus of wheat and rice in country by following pattern of giving msp and then procuring produce can also be done for other commodities farmers demanding from more than decade now have procurement system and msp for other crops which will not only help them save their groundwater which going down year by year but will also help india have sufficient supply of commodities which we importing from outside bringing in big corporations will neither help farmers nor consumers other point that not covered in this video that how punjab and haryana have spoilt their lands by putting in chemicals increase production and feed starving india of 1960s and now after using them and having sufficient supply of grains we saying we do not need your produce thanks for reading hope will understand that thousands of people sleeping on roads because of some reason

rakesh tries mislead farmers of our country but got success only in punjab trying spread rumor about riot
2 if there msp maintained not like subsidizing agro industry itself and subsidies mean artificially allowing industry operate at low profits or even losses with msp in place crops can be sold at lower prices than should be artificially keeping food price inflation in check at high level of course there agents aadtis and middle men who away lions share in ways of commission bribe which makes product pricing not too low either but internationally our raw food prices definitely lower which benefits entire nation in terms of cheaper food available but also one important factor in citizens producing more more children driving population up which we have clearly seen since green revolution and hence puts more pressure on same system that stands on whilst also making sure of more environmental damage so subsidies do not help they only help protect mediocre pricing keeping same farmers pegged back and not able explore better pricing and bring more agricultural efficiencies in place imagine netherlands with proper use of hydroponics and no subsidies they have been able become second largest food exporting nation in world whilst being smaller than maharashtra

2 price of commodities even now not government regulated government intervenes only if prices go too high or too low in order not let either of parties incur loss and farmers not always going sell or selling at loss only in certain situations they however government clarified that msp will not be removed which means farmer always protected can sell in apmc if there steep fall else can earn more in open market
very unfortunate situation kisan community deserves protection and all support
let farmers decide whats best for them we talking about 500 farmers association with lakhs of members they know each and every alphabet in bill farmers telling all three bills tailor made for corporates they have all resources and advocates understand this bill association even said cannot be made by government because so micro detail that farmers will be blocked from all 4 corners farmers association already had 5 meeting 2 in punjab and 3 in delhi but still they adamant about not applying only thing they want from government loose all this 3 bills and apply msp even u government said this death bill for farmers 36 ministers from u has sent letter modi not apply this bill this bill has already been applied in western countries and flopped big time only looks ok on theory but not in practice bottom line this bill was not put into place with good intention government knew its cons gov thought farmers stupid and brought this kala bill swiftly during corona crisis on june 2020

some argue that there no tax on farm income in india this argument does not stand closer and fact based scrutiny minimum limit of taxable income in india about rs 500 000 huge majority of farmers will never touch this limit even if they were earn at their full msp so where benefit of this exemption and does that also exempt farmer from indirect taxes that has pay for every other item of farm input gst has be paid on every tool service seeds diesel

huge chunk of food grains grown in india goes pds public distribution system and central government purchases same and distributes state governments for distributing beneficiaries of public distribution system pds big corporates and other big guns with lot of money and power at their hands have this ever prevailing ready market and purchase food grains at 50 65 cost of minimum support price msp from areas where there no apmc mandis apart from punjab haryana and western up and this very much procured food grains go central pool at minimum support price earning profit of nearly 80 100 if all food grains bought judiciously at minimum support price then corporates and so called middlemen will not be earning much profit this one of reason that why corporates desperate have these three farm bills make upto hundred percent profit and spending no amount on marketing big question why government favouring corporates and not farmers

congress ruled country for more than 65 years and they did nothing upgrade archaic laws has 55 years for country come up with new laws for farm sector when relevance of political party becomes low resistance any change obvious now role of state governments ensure msp for small growers as pm has repeatedly made clear that existing msp untouched and in fact there delta increase since majority of states under bjp those states should leaf out book and protect small marginal farmers in fact economists have lauded governments initiatives if congress desires consolidate itself as political force should work with government as constructive opposition but should stop opposing every law for sake of being in opposition

and those who actually doing riots not even indians they may be indians by birth but not by mindset shame on those who took charge and said that rally will go peacefully i was supporter of silent protest till yesterday but today they have lost my support and support of millions of other indians
3 40 farmers taxes paid apmc mandi maintains roads that connect mandis and enable transport of produce if mandis not maintained maintenance of these will be affected okay if private competitors come will they airlift all produce not private companies going arrange easy access produce for themselves they will once they can why these facilities not good already 70 years after independence that too in india bread basket or whatever we teach in school because nobody has cared till now
true that farm laws cannot completely solve problems infact in long term poses many threats too but retrieving already inefficient apmc mandi system just like wanting go back jail has always exploited farmers but in that light farm laws certainly revolutionary reform for sector but some research in bihar have proven that taking off of apmc system not going benefit farmers rather than put them in far more stressing condition so farm laws eventhough have many good points in will benefit farmers only if loop holes in laws closed one of concerns exploitation by big private players and agriculture not like any other sector we cannot predict nature and hence harvest so that farm laws will not turn into another apmc style also agriculture sector and system in india so complicated but noteworthy that south indian states have different systems get max profit for their produces one of system uzhavar santhai in tamil nadu interesting system
my full support with farmers

explanation of farm bill what my friend calls non farmer explaining what farmer needs rule of selling in district market not at all prevalent in south my fiends grows in madurai and sells in trivandrum and did not even know rule apprehension that government will bring end free electricity farmers laws have never applied in south india but suspicion against central government very deep
dalal would tell rates farmers and farmers will have sell as per dalal rate
as far as i understood bill for companies not for farmers
proud of my farmer brothers
another disadvantage of contract farming that company might ask for specific quality of crop which farmers cant ensure as crops grow under open skies unlike potato chips in factories so if theres excess rain or presence of weed in crops that will increase price of harvest therefore harming already poor farmer
with large section of indian population who farmers livelihoods at stake natural for them suspect intentions of current rulers seeing botched implementation of gst and bad decisions like demonetization one cannot simply accept anything thrown on oneself without protest althoug current set of farm laws were looking ground breaking at face one cannot ally fears what might happen when these implemented similar situations have occured in with negative results where corporates have undue advantages i think these laws need be redone with extensive discussions with farmers from every state and slow but careful implementation needs be thought out devil always remains in details

all taxes which there they not put on farmers if msp 2000 farmer sell crop at 2000 taxes paid by buyer not farmers and apmc in punjab lot easy reach with in 3 5 km

though i like all of your videos but this time i am not convinced as i myself am farmer from uttarakhand have vast knowledge of academics but i suggest following
government made these rules help and support rich traders and not farmers problems that farmers facing wont be limited farmers alone they will next show up in general society as well current government has succeeded in placing future of next generation of children of this country into deep slavery by promoting endless privatization transferring wealth riches performing changes in rules that were protecting democracy so far

its just one part of protest that was not required moreover farmers being protesting peacefully from arond 5 months but govt not listening they been sitting on roads in this extreme winter for their rights tractor prade was completed peacefully nd historically on all routes people were raining flowers on farmers as welcome except these few black situations
our plates full its not like we affording its bcz farmers cultivating for
govt should not work with ego farmers bill not welcomed by farmers then why they not revoking totally undemocratic and cheap tricks played by bjp as usual since 2014
also most of small farmers dont go govt mandis for msp they sell their crops local vendors price they get way more than msp msp can only benefit big farmers who put peoples on job for agriculture
agriculture our wisest pursuit because will in end contribute most real wealth good morals happiness farmer has be optimist or would not still be farmer good farmer nothing more nor less than handy man with sense of humus
modi or bjp mooh baal geera modi dont play with jumlas and joot phoot shoot leaders beware
three hours of electricity farmers shame
technology methods small farm sizes wont physically support and farmers cant afford substitution of human effort for mechanical so labour intensive and inefficient millennia old farming practices continue

secondly cost of our produce wheat rice and sugar mention few higher than prevalent international prices landed cost of wheat at our ports from say australia or canada lower than cost of wheat transported from north india south high price tag as fixed by msp despite low labour costs due higher cost of agro inputs such as fertilizer despite subsidy cost of fuel such as diesel agro chemicals agro equipment however these issues remain unattended
how can common people from other states can help farmers pls tell sir thinking write letter pm if we all ryt atleast they can hear
progressive farm laws have been repealed on context of failure in getting some farmers of 2 and quarter state on board in large country problem since its shows victory of mobocracy and anarchy template laid out and succeeded in demonstrating that reforms not possible if few rich farmers individuals streets despite thumping majority its pity bjp not winning punjab neither khalistani threat going away with this move rather government has projected weakness and cluelessness opposition will use this template for sure but its not good for country since external forces and think tanks of china pakistan and khalistani terrorists have congnisance too

feel proud of being lndian made possible by our farmers especially punjabi farmers in forefront
sad because haryana government had decided that they want 75 reservation for local people and they were going pass that bill like saying that newyork corporation needs hire 75 people only from newyork not from other parts of united states so modi had withdraw farms bill not first time state governments in india always try implement this rule they do not want people from other states flocking into their state mainly targeted at up bihar which most populous states in india so alot has been going on in background and not win total loss of india if look in terms of country prospective

when mulla umar established taliban govt they shut farming of afeem just only on one order in whole afganistan
farmers lost
i have supported farm laws though i thought some ammendments could be done but not repeal at all i think this lesson for government because for sensitive issues like agriculture where 60 of people depends reform should be bottom up not top down approach way bill was passed in rajya sabha has created perception of distrust among some farmers from very start every state has different agriculture pattern based on its economy and geography so one size fits all approach has made discontent further more problem that now atleast for next 10 15 years no reform can place in agri sector
kisan majdur ekta zindabad rakesh mishra and his son should be arrested

how delhi police could highjack kejriwal govt public bus for stopping farmers
farmers unable pay middlemen money not that reason for farmer suicides
personally i was happy about this new farm law because this motivated new generation of young farmers who have new farming idea and can sell either government or big corporate buyers and make money free of tax all dreams shattered
if modi has guts let him change fci into food corporation of punjab haryana and start another system for rest of india
bihar has implemented these laws 15years back and can see where they ended now they work in punjab and haryana
kissan never will vote bjp till murkh leader ship will be charged like modi and amit
this u turn deeply disturbing and makes me loose confidence in democracy appears that modi cares only about election wins and clinging power thousands of silent farmers have been betrayed for electoral gains
sc sleeping or what sc had allowed farmers protest how can they arrest
government tweaking of commodity or its prices have be seen as action of extreme situations and other times market forces must prevail if problem lies with intermediary agencies there should be legal provisions contain actions like hoarding and artificial market manipulations government should try minimise intermediaries and get producers more easy access and transport of their produce market framers need only such help otherwise market will determine value however there global glut and price drop that would destabilise living income of farmers disastrous state they may have be rescued by offering minimum prices for such commodity protect farmer and him on farm until market price can support commodity these difficulties for farmer world over occasional socialism may be required balance books
not political party lost bloody polititians loss for poor farmers
my full support ti farmers and
why modi or amitshah did not visit farmer protest site all these 9 months and promise farmers of msp agriculture state subject but bill was passed with out consulting states and by cancelling question hour in parliament when bill was passed completely unconstitutional

media disappointing they should have educated farmers on benefits and cons of farmer laws
3 punjab farmers richest farmers in india per data they get power subsidy fertilizer subsidy pm kisan benefits few state govt subsidies amounts min 1 5 lakh benefit per each farmer per month pubjub most backward in agri market compared maharashtra and karnataka when will they change if their mindset stuck existing comfort zone

farmers have been protesting peacefully for 2 3 months and most of them still but minority did get violent however what has not been showed how police was beating up some protesters who were causing no trouble at all some even speculate that these riots were planned by government put farmers in bad light but no one really knows farmers have been protesting have newly introduced bills back
wrong in punjab in past bjp never contest more than 20 22 seats absurd statements by mr abhijit never bjp ruled punjab priority china preparation for attack india after olympics 15 02 2022 until 30 04 2022 will be war period we lost mr arun jaitley who was diplomat in local agenda mukth congress at punjab that correct statement by mr abhijit
best videos on farm bill made by print thank shekar gupta
on other hand this would naturally welcome private traders middlemen with their wealth resources education tech now how logistics etc and would be buying produce across states global at odd times with lowest price given indian farmers thereby these private traders middlemen will become hoarders and this evil would be disastrous for indian farmers and country
there not farmers u pagal

this age of social media within hours reality has been exposed this another try of shaheen bagh but will also see same fate as shaheen bagh modi ji will only gain more out of these disruptions

were funding farmers agitation because they have vested interest in
many big farmers in india have bonded labourers in their field and they talking about rights hypocrisy
congress we will help arrested people free of cost in court and will donate blanket in jail and will still say that danga bjp gundo ne red fort
if tikait succeeds in breaking this monopoly of corrupt then will truly unite indian people into multiracial movement and change indian politics forever
this withdrawal i am sure has hurt yogiji from within i am sure would never have gone back like modiji had been pm time hindus start getting more vocal and start defending their rights or else we and more our future generations will have pay brunt
if all farmers stop there farms then fix price of all farming products with govt then start farming

greatest living punjabi greatest living indian manmohan sir

best and deep information for farmer
wat hopeless government farmers our back bones not ambani or adani treat them respectfully
haryana home minister concerned about kangana but not concerned about laathicharge on farmers in haryana
gupta ji please do not brush aside concerns of those who oppose because unlikely that farmer has choice transport and sale his produces wherever prices higher also as of today only 6 of farmers get msp benefit so msp not removed does not hold much water also there potential corporatise agriculture which unlikely benefit farmers remember jio
bjp cannot win punjab and they know
farmers fighting for country
shows clearly they fully funding from outside rakesh and wanted our india never and ever be developed country
hello ge i need clarification here in second bill u said middle man can again advantage of famers due persecution but govt already eradicated middle man in 1st bill so by which farmer can directly sell consumers from using 2 bills transperantly
dont know every year more than fifteen thousand farmers commit suicide basically these bills for benefit of farmers ultimate goal farmers should be paid more no more suicides better and sustainable farming techniques and more security of farmers interest
thanks our constitution right protest win farmers win
proud be son of farmer thnxx for raising voice of farmers dhruv rathi
poor farmers with poor cars protesting in low income country usa and most of them belong poorest state in india in terms of agriculture punjab
these farm laws would have industrialise farming in india but alas india should have accepted rcep these farmers would have been obliterated by industrialized australian and argentine farmers in indian market
3 why having apmc since 1965 still ensures only 6 of farmers getting msp
these only few examples due heavy losses there many farmer suicides in southern and central states
if do not need then we do not need going forward if manipulate prices arkej or soga or maba may believe but we indians will not
farmers smarter than modi i am mind blown by their understanding of system
those say why there more sikhs in these protests becoz green revolution started from this region which made india self sufficient in food punjab haryana and up organisations well informed they have lawyers judges and doctors in their cadre they know exactly what these laws they very clear about laws only confused case of india government and some stupid people of india who thinks modi will do everything good for them modi did not do good for his own state farmers cotton was procured for gujarati farmers at 1300 in manmohan singh govt in 2013 and in 2020 its price was 700 thats what modi doing farmers
win of ignorance lack of drive understand bill and lack of empathy for other farmers but anyway democracy popularity contest
america one of few countries who dared challenge taliban what did india do we did not send our forces america prevented taliban from growing for 20 years
more power farmers satyamev jayate
i think these bills were milestone for farmers and govt should not took step back some modifications can be done by govt but replenishment of bills will impact on farmers in long term
so clearly explained and now crystal clear what farmers going through
rakesh ji tikaat not only farmer baabar sher on farmers
journalists protest only against government when they feel govt not right but never counter protest against protestors when they feel govt laws right does not matter if farmers protest if feel laws correct then should go and counter protest
why did not highlight fact mentioned by nc saxena at 7 46 clearly mentioned that not just government buying wheat at almost twice price from farmers its has not increased price of selling poor please do not mislead nave people be unbiased in your analysis there no difference between and that chaudhary guy from znews just that on opposite sides bharat mata jai
difference between china and india china can progress well by implementing good changes whereas india cannot implement any change due their political system about this farmer issue i watched documentary how political opposition gathering non farmers impersonate as real farmers and create unnecessary trouble solution all indian problems give prime minister modi same powers as chinese president has over decision making for his country but that will make india super power which could be good thing for world as i have learnt from indian history that india can only spread message of peace non violence since ancient times i have never seen original indians being aggressive or violent in fact indians have never been good at fighting and wars bear in mind that almost 33 of indian population now not original indians
every one has right protest peacefully but public should not be disturbed govt and farmers should talk on this matter bussinessman like adani should not be allowed purchase farmers crop small farmers should be helped by government big farmers should give tax govt msp should be given farmers
how pathetic these people in comments saying we support farmers just by seeing this video well done india
i am indian farmer i will tell this this issue related only 2 states that punjab and haryana no where else farmers protesting in india for long time farmers in punjab and haryana grew at expense of other farmers in india now that their monopoly broken they crying about i repeat i have no issue with farm laws brought by government of india
and i want say within few weeks will 1year complete farmer protest so we will support them becoz godi media will not support they will defamed them
no farmers in protest they all left goons
this farmer want msp even selling private player what nonsense this if that private player start importing agriculture product for benefits then price of food skyrocketing this going whole level destruction
imwithfarmer
very sad political parties responsible for all these vehicle of bjp leaders hit farmers and killed them they should be punished according law death of innocent very unfortunate failure on part of state government
well we will have wait for kolkata elections see whether general public support modi or farmer only if bjp does badly in these elections will we see early settlement
also this agitation ignited by land owners large tracts of land of dalits oppressed community was grabbed during khalistan movement not cultivators and workers who actually who work in farms and treated in subhuman ecosystem
i hope modi ji govt must withhold these reform bills give thorough rethinking involving farmers inputs let our indian farmers not feel insecue at hands of welcoming middlement private traders manage their produce this will save nation will save modi ji dream of nav bharat
again i think disputes really hard win for farmers incase of any misadventures from these companies unless atleast poor farmers given unconditional protection from exploitation in any court and at least be able get back their expences for loss due misunderstanding from clauses hoping educated farmers at least aware of contract and what they signing into
farmers protest bjp nhi milne mr choudhary saab
one major assumption that most farmers use mandi system figure around 50 50 those who like using mandi system like fact they store storage system credit etc while others dislike because of corrupt officials out side of mandi there no msp and frankly most marginal farmers sell out of mandis only
i indian with few of my family farmers now leme tell news seriously wrong and biased many farmer think nothing of law and most thinks its good thing few in 2 states dont like now know
i think godi media should learn how do reporting from u
me too son of farmers can understand whole scenario
18 05 couple of points 1 if contract done for 2000 company cannot arbitrarily reduce price afterwards and have honor as per rule 2 if company offers contract price of 500 down from 2000 for next contract why presenter says that farmer does not have choice farmer still free contract with someone else offering higher price or may choose cultivate whatever and sell in apmc at msp price as that structure still present
grain in punjab haryana msp rs 1950 why its rs 950 in madhya

those who support these protect first study farm law before commenting or supporting any side no one open eye last 70 year when farmers doing mass sucides because there no reform now reform here why protect
shame on zee tv few days back were showing that broders empty now defame leaders showing now that farmers on roads in rains etc where were earlier
if farmers can sell directly and farmers given freedom then that means people who protesting middleman or agents then all this protests for this agents or middleman in name of farmers as easy gain sympathy over farmers name

1 allow fci engage in contract farming current msp as set by govt higher than international market price but what makes even higher taxes and commissions paid in mandis which does not go farmers by bypassing mandis and allowing direct procurement by fci markets prices can be streamlined without hurting farmer incomes fci arm of govt of india

today mr gupta got chance of targetting everything at modi government i mean this episode could have been stayed at farm laws but how come miss this chance of pulling out dead bodies from graves
farmers also got trapped in modi jumla also got upset in same way way citizens across country troubled in future
really loved way part where 94 farmers who till today sell their crops at prices way less than msp msp for paddy 1925 quintal average selling price 1400 1450 quintal was conviniently ignored by dr sharma mentioned around 6 40 saying sirf points pr focus krta huun jinko lekr kisaan naraz will not in account why majority of farmers not protesting i also believe that assuring msp best way forward for farmers but giving msp only 6 farmers from majorly punjab and haryana does not do justice for other 94 i also fear monopoly of large corporates in buying produce but will still be way higher than what 94 farmers get today
i stand with farmers high time that we as citizens stand up against this fascist regime and question this government for filling pockets of so called industrialists
protest isnt violent police were violent so farmers defended themselves
first let laws apply they might be better for farmers they want change but do not wanna change
naman for 700 sacrifice of farmers
farmers not so smart but they have honest experienced leaders history

26 january tractor rally permission ssr 3 modi ji photo
whatever discussion people do about bottom line that modi had done for election only
read newspaper will actually know more than what indian or foreign media will tell
farmers r protesting just on basis of forecasts or assumptions like this may happen or that may happen however farmers r free sell their crops anywhere if they think that dealing with corporates will lead extinction of mandi system than they should stick old system that selling their crops in mandi
their demands for recognition of msp as statutory right whittling down of commission for air quality management in national capital region and adjoining areas ordinance 2020 and withdrawal of cases on farmers seems unreasonable and naive for following reasons
first india right now setting things right in its kashmir and north east important we must have welfare there should we do spade for spade with taliban now and complicate our problems or play safe game our enemy those who challenge our borders our enemy those who challenge our national security
takait misguiding farmers 3 law in favour of farmers

one more missed pm said that old method not going abrogate this method just option for farmers and also msp will not stopped after pm said these i think this best thing for farmers that they had 2 options for crops farmers thinking that apmc and msp will abrogated but pm said in loksabha that old method will be continued this just option
farmers of punjab
6 farmers were become self reliant
why this punjab and haryana farmers doing this their many other farmers in india they not doing this only punjab have problem by this
yogiji have do something in this issue
cannot explain so called farmers this protest was never about farm laws
i think repeal not right choice but review and some changes if needed some more laws regulate private companies so that they wont misuse their power i think that would be better by discussing these with farmers union please dont make such useful laws like this go waste as this has potential improve farmers life much times better
our media calling farmer misguided and terrorist sad reality
every govt organization that was supposed help people had become mafiadom not only apmc if so easy make apmc work in orderly manner then why in 55 years has only been degrading through multiple govts i have seen how farmers suffer because of this if anybody dares his her produce directly market quickly brought under control through threats

while state and center elections happening i think while people casting their vote they should have options yes no related state and center rules that state trying impose on state and center proposing country and pass any bill state or center 50 should be considered from people of india and 50 from elected representatives mla mp this way we can consider direct input of republic of india and issues like farmers bills and article 370 and some of state levels bills can be handled better also all parties should think of their bills and proposals part of their agenda ahead of time and stick unless some emergency situations like natural disaster and covid 19 related situation arrives for which we may not be able plan before election juts idea
yogi ji will need strict action here
thanks lot finally i understand what exactly farmer bill greatly explained positive and negative aspects

i do not understand what problem means rule says that if farmer wants can sell his produce without any broker u know farmers get just 2 rs for tomato which we get at 40 so eliminating broker amazing step so why these men resenting and truth that all of these men dalals or brokers or little number of farmers in there either brainwashed or once who relatives of mps or higher commission officio who all advantage of government schemes
now laws gone hope farmers get their msp and govt effort make fair law for consumers and farmers

winning election different than running government covid response and recent mess in farm law indicate limitation of modi shah government ability right now people ready give them benefit of doubt and move on but repetitions of this type of problem will only weaken their ability win elections after elections at some point of time i believe in near future people will equate nda with upa both as ineffective incompetent governments
form law ppl did protest so many loss there lives then after many of days step back of decision this shows of immature decision making stop nonsense first opinion of all ppl tell them about good things of your laws then do some big steps if did this before so many farmers were still alive today

if ask anyone who supports this protest then they will say new laws will create existential crisis for poorest of poor farmers but when point out that these protesters can be seen driving freakin g wagon then they will say so believe farmers cannot be rich
i am with these farmers
support ndian farmers
yesterday was mundi raj tomorrow will be private raj i remember this agreement price raj for sugarcane where sugar factories owners used set price upfront and farmers used fail sell their sugarcane anywhere else
yet law was very revolutionary some flaws were there why they repealed instead they could have added msp protection in contract farming law and modified some other provision that was what farmers were protesting yet again they did blunder and will pose blame on farmers true that some protester were not farmers but causes were genuine we can see how jio flipkart amazon killed competition this would have happened with farmers in contract farming laws protection was needed which was msp but alas
this not only affects farmers also affects consumers since corporates decide price of each commodity
india hawa tight hi now china try dominate make partnership with talibsn with help pakistan shrmnak hi america 20 saal nikaal football khelne mi

this abhijit iyer makes few valid points and i align with criticism of modi for being soft hindutva guy but iyer praise manmihan singh as more patriotic than modi plain unintelligent manmohan singh presided over unspeakable loot and scams by congress party and total anti hindu program there no way that person can be termed as patriotic
very deeply clearly defined great work i am farmer from punjab reality at ground

bro forget about rss members how were in fake police dresses police supporting rss members and police killed farmer farmer arrested for no reason police firing on farmers pointed out only farmers mistakes and i agree with but should also tell what police did and no farmer had weapon only nihang singhs had weapons they came protect farmers from police
in hindsight i d say that these farm bill reforms could be introduced at state level so that each state can decide how fast proceed on these reforms states which wish progress more quickly can do so and reap benefits while states which wish go slower can do so and reap those consequences as well
reservation required basis on no of farmers in each state on fci budget allocation strictly
great brother atleast we can that we proud call ourself indians as we hide in our homes n just pass our words from one another rather helping those who full our stomachs our indian saying goes as jai kisan right where now i know they might have done some violence but do u think staying on roads for months for their rights n our good u calm be on road for month in cold weathers asking government listen them n in return no one listens them not even single action has been that greatness of our leaders who we vote i proud of this india

now they would force protesting farmers go back home and if they continue stay until new laws like mandatory msp not approved then they make scene that these farmers against modi or what not make his image as good person
our aim not make khalistan our aim stop nation from becoming modistan
in my opinion market should be further liberalized and requirement of trade licensing should be abolished but at same time government should employ economists fix minimum rate and maximum rate at which farmers and companies could transact if both sides do not agree on price outside that range
i stand with farmer
congratulations my farmers
one suggestion for govt that buying under msp creating lot many problems like storage and wastage one can think of giving difference amount as cash subsidy farmers without actually buying agri products this will save on cost of storage huge govt machinery destruction of grains etc we definitely need reforms in this sector
protesting farmers with tractors very rich and they have no sympathy from indians they getting free donations by opposition these farmers super rich and they not poor

farmers peaceful protest kr sarkar ne assu gas gole or water guns chlayi or bariketing or democracy khilaf log nhi or farmers ko fir roka farmer nhi ldega
will be bad for common people also as they big corporations will buy cheap from farmers and then stock up on grains and sell very expensive common people
so farm bill was good i thought was bad
meghnad has perhaps intentionally not explained that process of price discovery just fails in apmc mandis because licensed middle men collude together rather than competing against each other and quote single price which always equal or very slightly more than msp this simply because whole apmc system itself stupid from very inception and directly facilitates this
ordinance for this bill was already there for past 6 months this guy completely overlooked hyperbole from opposition politicians death warrant of farmers black laws etc etc while talking about kangana equally idiotic terrorist barbs at same time not so balanced as claim yourself be
only guaranteed law on msp can change lives of farmers
narrative that this anti national anti india pro khalistani protest sooo false and could not be further from truth there was not single khalistan flag at protest there were only tiranga flags nishan sahib flags and farmers flags nishan sahib flag and farmers flag was raised on empty flag pole no tiranga flag was down and remained as highest flying flag at lal qila throughout duration of protest
mediya always support bjp talk middle thattu channel
modi ji elite employee adani failed serve or make farmer slaves
this guy tariq sitting in canada talks lot of baseless nonsense i think some pakistani kicked his ass that why so against pakistan
today rich farmers won over poor farmers
only ndtv in india focusing on farmers issue but tamil medias and other regiona media keeping very quiet on this issue
bcz most of people who explaining this matter biased and have no idea about real situations of farmers
no mohak there farmers from west up rajasthan bihar and also from other states
big fall back for indian farmers
irony countries from which these protesters protesting from uk canada ones who opposing in wto subsidies given farmers trudeau and some british mp colonialists ones who opposing india in wto protesters should also look towards these govt too
haa all those bjp supporter farmers thought was their govt
these rioters not kisan real kisan busy in farming field but they those politicians or their agents who want come in politics

modi pagal full support farmers
farmers demands government roll back ordinances
school i appreciate way have explained however change dynamics in any sector important we steps every time required strategy explained big companies will follow true but that way how market works now bills proposed with very good intention and will fetch farmers great relief and earnings for sure may become problem in 4th phase of control then way out change law again something more feasible and practical how we will grow right we learn on fly and make better next time we implement but just sitting and doing nothing will surely not help in any way we should support government if they taking good steps however making msp legal something i also support but other than that looks like big positive step for farmers
indian farmers in much better shape and after law will only get better for farmers and businesses
strictly no for tractor rally
im farmer and im happy with kishan bill jay hind
slap in face of bjp supporters that claim modi visionary or decisive just cares about brand of party and not about policy
agr bill galat h too lgta opposition party ko khus bjp glti krr or aane election public bjp hara
govt need have seperate agency act as business resource center for farmers in each state that they can go give them business guidance teach them business negotiating skills etc
these laws force farmers sell their land sign contract for appx 15 years with private sector on predicided low price there also one law discard existing essential commodities act which will cause inflation price hike for essential crops like wheat and rise also now stock limit removed for corparates so that they can stock crops and increase price also now they do not have mandi place where they can sell appx near 5 kms of their land now they have sell across states and nobody gonna pay for transportation also they will not be given fix price can go below msp moreover contractor can loan on farmers land if they fail pay farmer will have pay loan or else their land will be auctioned
great sir kisano fight kro all indians with salute
watching all these scenarios i think this term would be last term for current government in india they will never even taste power now police behaving like rowdies and hooligans while their job serve public police should also think that these farmers their countrymen and producers of food that we eat these farmers should be treated like heroes of our country and five year guests should be ignored

just because farmers of punjab against and there election in up
pm modi crafted farm loot bills in consultations with ambani and adani

need similar workers movement in pakistan but our big bad wolf military corporation just look up okara military farms where military has occupied farming land and local farmers have been fighting their own fight without any help from anyone and country wide media blackout
if farmers dont want improve their situatio n just because of cheap politics then no one can do anything

government was worried how agri was still in positive in our gdp waah modiji waah
very informative and educative video presenter very clear in understanding and expressing viewers in media as some one commented this video should be dubbed in several languages especially hindi so that farmers can directly relate their problems and solutions i am only hoping that corruption and black money does not come in play between apmc and farmers i hope govt will consider all loop holes and plug them before bill becomes legal way for supply chain not clear from video whether farmer protest enforce msp minimum support price by govt included in bill also so very difficult establish msp for particular product for entire country since labor in farming will be so different between state state
how were laws suppose support atmanirvar bharat motto we have seen examples of similar laws in other developing countries developed counties subsidiary provisions for farmers ok but similar provisions in india problematic how ironic wto

thousands of farmers in states like maharashtra west bengal and orissa their lives and farmers from these states do not access apmcs and msp that farmers in punjab have punjabi farmers richest in country and they have become so under system that killing their state soil average farmer from maharashtra west bengal or orissa cannot afford tractors like these farmers can
not kisan mistake government mistake that they took decisions but do not preach what exactly bill and therefore bicholis and opposition took advantage by giving wrong knowledge real kisan and as we know that kisan mostly uneducated so they came under influence of wrong people still government have chance go and teach them what really act
there 15 cr farmers in india and 15 lakh sikh farmer they contribute 0 73 of total farmers if there problem with bill then r only minorities protesting even if sikh farmers richest farmer in india what about 10k farmer committing suicide each year they saying let them die we will not change if there already problem means we need do something about and this what ruling gov trying but because chunk of people protesting they not protester they parasite of country its basic reaction when doing something good for 100 people there always person who lazy n do not want change their ill habits

world stand in solidarity farmers
again half knowledge dangerous essential commodities act has been amended but there exceptions there restrictions hoarding in case of war famine natural calamities or if prices of food grains increase by 50 or horticulture product prices increase by 100 so no one can hoard artificially inflate prices need for amendment simple with new players coming in and bigger volumes of trade deregulation essential

today farmer back begging begging for some extra price for his produce may home 1500 instead of 2000 which deserved and that 500 belongs those protesting in borders
gov should have plan gradually move farmers more profitable and export quality crops by incentivizing targeted sectors instead of leaving them helpless all of sudden with no guarantee
bills in favour of farmers
very informative with generous amount of sarcasm ouch modi ji ouchh
for me eliminate both these mandi system and new law coz no body can assure minimum support price for anything coz this business and everyone have share profit and loss but research and find solutions why farmers getting low money for their products once in while ok its part of life but always means that there corruption dome by corporates authorities by manipulation so real solution change system based on coruption lies false news pseudo hopes and fear

farmers can sell their crop as they wish with out intervention of third party intrest once upon time long long ago they use sell crops directly with interchange of things my doubt u farmers how they sell their crops european farmers how they sell their crops russian farmers how they sell their goods after observing many developed countries farmers selling their products methods they should discuss with state governments and then with central government without doing any violence
laws repealed jst bcoz of punjab elections and for amrinder support
modi breakdown totally constitution of india

contractual farming for any issue farmers can reach only smc and dc of district

my question sugarcane grower farmers happy now was govt able manage fiscal deficit by doing away with msp for sugarcane how common man suffers because of this step
my village nevert support this bills
bill not bad farmers not wrong negotiated solution possible that will benefit farmers bill for them
not just fear as call fact and seen in many states already and suffering also obvious in farmers and big profits for already rich unfair in my opinion there problems as farmers agree but there needs be different approach not through dictatorship and ask farmers just obey just because government thinks good for them farmers human beings and have mind of their own too believe or not
know why they did not lathi charge or other types of charge because they farmers but when said last that can cause damage

issue isnt that punjabi farmers dont trust central government its that mandis much much larger in punjab and haryana then anywhere else in this nation and mandis will become weaker due these bills and many farmers even in these states happy with these bills this because that cost of transportation reduced and proper infrastructure would be provided by private player and talking about msp can find out msp which government provides on their website msp has increased compared last year

now scooters not vital for survival could say but food so imagine worst case scenario agro prices get controlled lower by adanis and ambanis of world by over stocking and benefit passed on retail customer and farmers run out of msp incentive as apmc markets start losing ground what will happen more farmers in debt land will be up by big corporates and they will start farming land themselves definitely possible but how any different from zamindars or apmc farming cartels taking control which already did happen and continues happen where can and prevented by farmers unions and governments where can so why will be any different if farmers get destroyed then government will anyways need step in no

3 why not naysayers like your website talk of how special non staple crops will get direct pvt sector buyers and their farmers will not have haggle with govt or govt boards over pricing and msps as they get less attention than staple crops in public mind and mostly cash crops tobacco lobbies ran full page ads calling ppl oppose tobacco bans and support tobacco farmers even driven by pvt ambition this not at all useful for farmers in your opinion
if market rate 10 but rate fixed in contract 20 then farmers can sell their produce at 20 and company has buy if company denies buy farmers can file case against them on basis of contract as their proof
bjp backed by rss back these black agriculture acts considering coming forth election in up and other parts of four states kisan andolan should continue peaceful

farmer can use fan blow away tear gas opposite direction
repealed laws at cost of 700 farmer lives dear farmers salute your unshaken determination of not giving up your peaceful protest taught many things and among all power of peaceful protest
nicely presented but forgot mention that farmers have still option sell mandi their choice whether enter into private deal or market or do business as usual as for essential commodities true that this amendment can encourage hoarding eventual price rise inflation did not mention base price with ref which those percentages will be calculated point here if anything people at large ones be offended affected by potential for price rise while farmers have chance make more money surprisingly public quite calm about laws while those who likely be benefited apparently agitated about amendments will be useful if can explain possible real undercurrents for their anger that makes them carry protests for such long time with strong demand on repeal of these laws in fact people need be told what at stake for various stakeholders in this play how these laws when implemented can contribute growth of our economy in general by way of both higher efficient agricultural produce as well as by roping in taxes that were conveniently evaded by middlemen in industry

all i wanna say that these not real farmers some might be real but if they were then by now india would probably start facing food shortage its been over 8 months still everything normal across country however makes me wonder its been 8 months still those people protesting how can they manage their family like this arent they facing money shortage how they able afford their living prices who funding them
19 50 farmers in punjab and haryana can be persuaded move sowing mustard and lentils but govt needs incentivise just like government creates sezs just like provides subsidies various other industries
3 farmer cannot go court if there any dispiute but corporates can go court agianst farmers
contract based never works with most of farmers in reality farmers cannot wait with their products for long time bargain for good price because its food product will get expired by storage accumulation and market manipulation corporates can easily dominate farmers farmers forced sell their products what ever price they get coz getting something better than throwing of expired products these already happening in many states where mandi system corrupted
why that government of india wants bring in new act through central government only why not act be pass through systematic assurances by every state government so that farmers have laws with their betterment that they have relied so far
there some conflict in this bill if this bill will contain clauses for msp then i am sure private player will not give more than that they will always give farmer only msp so open market concept will be gone in that senerio i think and if government does not msp clauses in bill now again will concern farmer because non one know that private companies will give price or not i mean all price will be set by private player only they can do anything than so in between need find out
zee news how much charge for true news about farmers protest can have some expert who can explan that 3 farms laws right or wrong can able interview farmers and policymakers both

of course farmers protest illegal full of violence and haughtiness govt of india also insensitive scrap agril bill if unacceptable farmers create jobs alleviate poverty day may come when jobless and hungry people would create same scenario
good very good so people who protests in front of mla car they need be punish farmer fault but bjp can kill they have free hand
see man previously govt has not emphasizes about rolling out of msp in act for that triggered of nationwide farmer agitation on contetious firm laws now gov t has decided retain msp instead of wiping out
mohak silently said that farm bills good but problem only of trust
msp also has same problem if supply increases and cost of priduction equals msp then farmer finished contract prices however protects downside contract buys at pre agreed prices even if prices fall that season why this left out small farmers will shift contract farmi8ng when they see this as wiser choice mandis will still be available and apmc too as optioons this was renegoriated changes govt already agrees and modi says msp will still be there who will sell at msp when either contracted prices give higher or market5 prices go up at mandis last leg of this how create access small farmers other than contract farming this can be thrashed out easily if unions demand creation of supply chains cold storage logistics by government or private sector instead ofr negotiating such very negotiable demands demanding socilaist era bottlenecks be in place forever smothers farmers into state subisdy dep endency stagnation and poverty presentation says mandis run by state governments leaving out ruling party men politicians and rich farmers getting into them naturally such loss or privileges determine prices for poor farmers lost and such parties like akalid dal oppose control of manids and options outside mandis for poor farmers put simply actually rich farmers and rich farmer political leaders running mandis who tell poor farmers they will perish if they leave this triangle of mandis they control msp that flat lines and subsidies into contracts protecting price crashes and freedom sell in others states and commodities markets
without farmers there will be nothing eat and drink
english dikha police age protest krr singhu border educated kisan aur bjp gunda ban gya
while i agree that stakeholders should have been consulted and included in lawmaking process i also think that will years make these important much urgent reforms now rolling back farm laws sets wrong precedent as well especially since decision was stretched out for well over year pandemic year that too and because supreme court was mediating this as well
we farmers right we really knows how deal with those disloyal cattles
will punjab and haryana farmers now do similar agitation in states that do not pay any msp their farmers like west bengal odisha tamil nadu etc because poor farmers from these states would have been greatest beneficiaries of these farm laws
real farmers do not bring their swords kill policemen and sit on protests for 70 days
this will going benifits farmer only then border per haii kisan hi nahiii
do u know only punjab farmers were opposing why bcoz they were most benefitting from

thanks quint for showing indian media busey in some stars son case what value human life has here here people dead media busey in trp
even bjp gives their statements few mins before tv newsence shoots their episode so that bjp dont get roasted immediately
nice vedio sir but if govt think that there so many benefits of new farm law then why not govt becomes middle between farmers and private players and why not earn benefit and provide msp farmers
three new uncostitutional agricultural laws must be reject imediately
if only 6 hold such large also means maximum of them big traders or farmers they buy from small farmers as result they accumulated large portion of paddy on selling them through msp they get benefits that why only 6 constitute such huge proportion
in 2018 farmers from maharashtra protested frm nashik mumbai silently was remarkable whole indian media appreciated them
have done good research but not sure why left out cases against india in wto for giving msp our farmers countries like canada and usa court for these msp interestingly many politicians from these countries were first support these fake farmer protests msp not as easy as sounds
people of our nation do not get what right people do not fact check anything before and start protesting or fighting even if lie sellers and middle men will continue making profits and farmers will continue suffer
we support farmer
my father farmers do his work at farm daily we do not have time for protest then who they any idea

shame on delhi police laati charging on farmers
happy for efforts for explaining whole farms laws for farmers and i am extremely happy government bring these laws for betterment of one category of people farmers but just as we on other side as i was watching your whole video i would like know why government did not thought anything about middle man another category because india country where everyperson has equal rights
if farmers do not want these laws then put forward there demands for any other law because farmers dying in india and cannot work with old laws so what they need in new laws atleast show that ca not support farmers if they only ask we do not want any policy that stupid
my husband said farmers should own full supply chain from growing and harvesting crops production of end product this will give them more market power and they can charge competitive prices especially for foods that in high demand in organic produce indians becoming increasingly concerned about gmos and fertilisers so home grown organic produce bound be successful
even bjp has no simple mind why not put ample number of persons find out costing of each products produce by farmers and work our price for seeking with margin which can reduce tbier dependency on loan from either bank or sarafi each and every state having different costing factor if they would have done this no body can argue that there any loopholes favoure any big corporates so definately no chance if argue ment bjp slipping like kumbhakaran for granted that whatever they doing perfect but no way true for 14 crore farmers they can give 1millionnjobs from farmers community itself care of any problems issues woes from farmers commu nity address thier problems so then definately nobody can blame bjp govt but bjpnis not sincere about this indpife if implementing farmers crop insurance nbut i am sure has noway reached 14 crores farmers if would have reached not even single farmers have sucide but even bjpnschdme turn out be as good as congress used announce feeling new congress has born jaihind mahadev mahadev mahadev
communists wanted develop afghanistan from stone age country into modern one afghan people said no and with help of usa they defeated afghan socialists and soviets afghan people then choose taliban who allowed terrorists use their country as base attack usa usa invaded and tried develop afghanistan from stone age country into modern one afghan people supported taliban and even gave weapons taliban which caused gtfo asap chinese communists then become friends with taliban and now want develop afghanistan from stone age country into modern one i wish red fools best of luck
could this be true import of food grains cheaper for indian government because international prices low some economists have advised government import food grains rather buy from indian markets that way fiscal deficit can be controlled this thinking guides three laws government can import its pds needs and save money both on storage and purchase
let be clear on this farmers protest only small percentage of farmers that protested and large numbers middlemen ask yourself this question if this law was evil why did not whole farming community of country protest that would have made more sense in retrospect this politically motivated protest same as caa and nri bill people no fools they well aware of
now farmers will need talk supreme court
modiji i like your costume for this show best of luck jai hind
farmer can choose if want sell in mandi or not its farmers choice jai kisan jai bharath

shameless anchor padma farmers died first in sequence and instead of starting debate with that issue talking about ppl who died later obvious that running bjp agenda
actually this bill very good for farmers in future why they cannot understand fact
ca not we just make next talk between farmers and government public let get on television live so everyone can understand what going on transparency must let see whether these top leaders actually discussing something or not or they just want chaos
2 contract farming will be for crop not land farmer will decide price of his produce before growing
bro indeed this farmers well do because in india only punjab and haryana farmers were beneficial of msp not other states if msp would have been applied every state of country other farmers would have been as posporus as em
farmers never behave in this way
and what about so called farmers who killed 4 people
3 chief justice of india modi man
i am from farmer family and i have seen disaster of farming sector closely since last 40 years in fact there severe scarcity of manpower in agriculture sector throughout india time people protesting away from motherland should come back and join hands with their brothers sisters parents and relatives think wisely what i personally feel that what modi govt doing need of time and look into future for betterment of farming sector one should look possitively rather than shedding crocodile tears
police should stand down let public face farmer protesters leaders politicians who protesting disrupting traffic creating ruckus violence etc let public face violence only then will ghe public action against these fools and support police
we do not see punjab kisan leaders which were generally all time were seen in past surrounding mr tikait ex cm amarinder trying break them out

biased story and godi media
we with indian farmers and praying for their rights from modi government
i am not for or against farm laws and neither claim fully understand issues behind farmers agitation but i understand that farmers agitating against these laws and squatting on delhi borders for over 60 days know their fears and problems arising out of these laws better than anyone of including so called experts and also that government of today has not been able understand them or address their fears while agreeing that agricultural reforms or infact reforms in general must for growing economy i would not say that farm laws as brought about by government flawless speed of enacting laws and their exact nature matter of discussion and debate
maturity from leader point still farmers at loss here
millions of farmers across country will suffer under middleman local politicians and currupt govt officials for god knows how long
mr modi have not saw how many farmers were protesting that why saying that only part of farmers community were protesting probably few of them who were not protesting were compelled helpless due financially scarce poverty ridden environment have created since 2014 i congratulate farmers for their victory over tyranny
4 why cannot we promote better fpo fpc empower farmer make better deals rather than always saying that farmer cannot negotiate
bjp commenting whatever they want then why not farmers says about government

bjp party agenda promote for zee channel shame for
have u spoken farmers who already in this new farm laws and how much more money they making compared previous old farm laws
modi played well not surprised if can get away with something like 2002 poking farmers and disrupting their movement was never going be difficult for him
well explained about msp though i do not know why i can sense some contradictions from your earlier explanation of farm bills 4 months ago for eg there we understood rich farmers will be benefited out of new farm bills while here seems different
whole farmer law came and went but i did not understand what was wrong with them
and does modi think can win punjab by repealing laws
so chilled roam around nd see now what farmers going through they in such critical situations
there can be no unity among farmers krishan ekta just imaginary phrage policies that will help farmers of panjab hariyana and western uttarpradesh will hurt farmers of bihar karnataka and maharashtra
proud on our farmers love from jammu and kashmir
before modi celebrated his 4th birthday india created atomic energy establishment trombay aeet was later renamed as bhabha atomic research centre
bjp cell head from delhi resigns claims party misleading people support with farmers god bless farmers
following your logic they will just destroy punjab due their farming methods
thanks bbc news one best your eyes always open through entire world indian medias forget about values and dignity of their job
proud of farmers victory long live kishan movement long live democracy secularism constitution of india fascist government murdabad
then what about farmers of other states government should assure msp for farmers of all states so that all farmers can benefit of msp then msp assurance would be valid demand
after this i concerned about what kind of media we have and specially these foreign media houses like bbc who would criticise when laws introduced but would support when laws repealed because of mis reporting sad day
almost 700 farmers died
farmers protest and tractor rally was peaceful was provoked by bjp goons with help of delhi police same script as modi and godi tried malign shaheen bagh peaceful protest delhi gunda police deserve this
great see vice news reporting about farmer bill and sikhs emotions but can vice news courage own administration that and canada want force india govt do not giving msp farmers in india
please shoot this video again in hindi needs be circulated amongst agitating farmers too who suspicious of govt intentions

we must respect our farmer
by way i am all indian sugarcane farmer
no more support farmers shameful act govt must strict action
when sleep in warm blanket there farmers sleeping protest out in winter
if govt fixes reserve price for every item and restrict private companies sell at higher prices then definitely farmers as well as general public will be benefited by new laws under new laws farmers free sell their yield either apmc or any other company which pays them highest rate this will help double their income anyway why cannot farmers try think positively and give chance we should have trust in elected government since no party or no leader likes put people of their country in risk and invite trouble their own party
we have lot of other issue this strike only limited farmers doing stop by all way
this video proves what bjp capable of self proclaimed hindu saviors very dangerous people who can go any extent stay in power india must unite now throw this government sooner better for india

i appreciate your effort at least youtuber step up show true picture in front of people who does not know anything and they just start posting against farmers
media man so poor in conversation bloody bjp man in journalist face
perfect data presented for land holding patterns in rural areas as also land less labourers numbers further fragmented land holdings unviable land holdings and non existence of adequate agro processing units have compounded problem infact in initial years of nda govt this aspect was focussed and could not be implemented bcz of and cry raised by all these opposition parties vested interests in name of farmers thru this bill farmers have been given freedom sell their produce according their choice but again attempts being made that factual information does not reach all concerned your program has brought out facts including its background and explained bill in simplest way
up punjab kcr and lastly farmers effort placate all sabka sabpe raaj
so conclusion of your report mandi owners in loss not farmers
alot of police beating old elderly farmers where dharma

let govt invite all farmers union leaders from all over country in talk and let them face handful of leaders in protest solved not
first we need trash media in india
sins of modi rss against people decency and democracy of india just too great be excused
double getting angry when l think my future hands of modi who even not 8pass and another leader also pls youth wake uppppp and protest against bjp
great work was done in interest of nation congratulations may god bless most of apmcs not ready implement enam in interest of farmer
one of reason of not shifting farmers from paddy and rice others may be because paddy and rice much less prone insects and need less care as compared maize and other crops
whatever why government have not confidence of farmers before placing bill in parliament
big win for farmers now bring msp for farmers
achche din for farmers
irony most people commenting here in support of this new farm laws ones who never going be directly affected by these laws
bro one thing missed in price bill says farmer can come out of agreement with corporate without paying any penalty but corporate has pay penalty if goes back on agreement
jai modiji we with and nation
i am modi supporter but way they protesting i think gov should their law back
pity that government so scared that they not letting farmers put across their views
three steps forward one step backward perfect war principle poor people r mostly ignorant they r misled dont worry modiji your goodwill will be fruitful someday
i support farmers may their protest be successful
when u talk of transparency can u compare non educated poor farmer with educated corporate city guy who understands sensex listing what this comparison
brigade of bjp suvs run over farmers but nobody knows who even though everyon knows up bihar heartland of criminals and religious scammers turned politician and because of uncontrolled population already defunct education system has no chance cope so this so called hindi heartland
india now losing another information warfare i e 4th generation war sad see because of some people for their personal reason win this battle we people do not any responsibility for nation do not give fight against them
they were not ready for discussion on farm bill but now want discussion on repealing of farm bill
even middleman such as your local fruit vendor adds value by providing both consumers and farmers with convenience consumers and farmers both dont need travel far get best price please dont paint middlemen in wrong light if there multiple middlemen that can definitely be reduced
jawan too son of farmer
these corporate owned channels and their godi presenters well batted mr rakesh tikait

if was from farmers family would not tell them turn away and go
finally farmers brought down mighty tree that bjp rss combined including godhi media
thanks for reporting on farmers issue ndtv only hope in true and honest journalism
i think bengal should cancel rally fr bjp
government says there will be msp but can assure whether procurement will be done at msp can give written assurance that farmers will get msp for their produce questioned one of many farmers protesting against bills
why government acting silly farmers backbone of our economy they should be out there in fields not on roads please make peace with farmers
farmers these people died not leaders son or leader went kill farmers got killed too sad news god watching everything
hi appreciate your work suggest of can create your next video along with dhruv then will surely help farmers lot
v nice i was able clear my doubts about msp mandi and apmc need of shifting crops etc thku sir
mr shekhar gupta i am pointing out another case of government inaction we know our most difficult neighbor pakistan and pakistan brain sits in lahore city of 1 25 crore population and capital of its most populous province punjab both lahore and amritsar considered twin cities dr manmohan singh wanted reach out intelligentcia of lahore from its closest window in amritsar started construction of fm tower 300 meters high in 2006 but 15 years in works this high powered external service radio station has not become operational pakistan talking amritsar using battery of 6 radio transmitters 3 high powered medium wave transmitters and 3 fm transmitters in return we cannot make even one high powered fm transmitter operational modi government left hand does not know what its right hand doing
so why do punjabi farmers benefit from msp while other indian farmers do not that not fair either so either all farmers should get msp or none at all
bjp son hit farmers and now 4 farmers dead so that we did okkkkkkk
ok so after seeing entire video have just reiterated think tank niti aayog 2018 report about reducing procurement of wheat and rice from haryana and punjab alright i get your point but what everyone should in mind its india that we living in and current govt just acts on whim and does not involve people like educating them what have not described in this video impact of these upcoming bills on farmer yes i totally agree that apmcs need be fixed but system works there problems but works and we all know what happened with gst demonetisation etc
obviously similar situation cannot be ruled out for local goods traded by local small farmer vis vis his corporate clients
give farmers their rights they also indian
then these law can be implemented by state government that will help state eventually and that state could become role model of prosperous farmers
hence instead of this mindset mentality that best quality will get msp and anything else will get below msp on gradual level wrong this exploitation mentality and results farmer suicide who couldnt sustain
one day indian will proud on ravish sir thousands salute
they love and very much fond of rather become habitual of andolan they don t want let trains run in punjab because they have personal vehicles for transport poors facing problem because railways life line of india
why all protesters here panjabis why have they come up protest there no kissans in up bihar or west bengal where from they getting huge money roam over india without doing any work they not any way farmers
i urge govts withdraw apmc cess which farmer need pay
govt i think must do unlawful act against kisans thats why internet banned

aree india aukat talibans direct combat sake taliban busy in formation of their government but once they established their fixed presence in afghan then they might be looked on india bcoz problem for india that china has already shaked hand with talibans now china pakistan and now afghanistan enemies for india and unfortunately those surrounded india

modi government should accept demands of farmers give them there wrights every one united against injustice modi has no wife or kids does not understand problems of farmers and there family
only punjab farmers
when modi turned two india held its first general elections in 1952
abhijit lyer i feel like anti hindu speeches some of missing realastic hystory of hinduism in india and showing sympathetic speech about hindus im agreed that there misleading in hystory becouse of i think congress but currently not done because of bjp stonge leadership
now kissan on lowest level of poverty and in dying stage legal msp essential right of farmers if not done farmers getting low money and consumers paying high money wealthy stockist will be biggest looser that going be india historical disaster
pm modi would cowed down anything repealed farm laws frightened pm fearing break up of union from 3 cornershe may even put back article 370 restore kashmiri autonom
nice video on farm bill 2020 i have seen many video but could not understand when i have seen ur video i have understood every process and new term about farm bill 2020 thanku sir
during meetings centre ensured msps they will make ammendments for that they have also given that they will allow civil courts in these bills but farmers protestors did not wanted that also they only wanted 3 bills bcoz they middleman and not farmers
govt ready give assurance about msp in written format but not willing mention in particular law that hypocrisy how can be this explained your video more tilted toward problems of apmc laws rather than what potential threat can be generated by private players if they allow procure agril product below msp when govt can change previous apmc acts and can build new laws make cold storage and can make another provisions for quick and efficient transportation of agricultural products then why give such grand way private market players control economy why cooperative structure very well established and proven best in maharashtra and gujarat in case of sugarcane industry n milk production respectively or farmers produce organization fpo not given more attention than giving more control few capitalist family
make crying dear seeing believing after 1984 sikhs was portrayed as separatist or khalistanis bcz of media was not showing real pictures now this generation has seen what kind of peoples these 3 who always stood for injustices whether its on them or someone else this teachings of our gurus
farmers struggle will bring new era of democracy
only 6 farmers sell at msp please tell this fact also whole msp system flawed total subsidy farmers cost 3 60 000 cr in 2019 that more than indian defense budget now let that sink in msp only for 23 notified crops not all r covered
adani agent modi will bring back adani farm law after elections continue protest until agent defeat
i completely object ur analysis u may even think hoisting pakistan flag beside india flag also correct because they just 0 01
this unruly mob collection in name of farmers must be crushed by arresting 30 40 kisan netas and putting them behind bar
more than 750 farmers died in order open their eyes
two heavyweights of punjab and maharashtra were ruined with these bills
pm modi incomputant pmime ministers india ever recived after our indipendance
new laws do have potential improve financial condition of farmers imf chief economist gita gopinath had too said this but has own loopholes which can be misused against farmers
iam hindu but i believe more in humanity than in religion or any party idont care whether its bjp or congress all i want peace for my indian brothers and sisters
tikait ji tho do yaar vote for bjp only
bjp people top bottom ready tell lies haryana bjp cm also not exceptional
i support farm laws anti farm law protests itself anti farmer and anti national period
even if these 3 bills still becomes reality think of middlemen who would ensure small farmers that they would transport their yield and sell at higher prices in far off locations as small farmers would not have time and transport capability drive at least 100 km think of taxes levied on state borders on farmers who transporting their yield in different states now all highways going be flooded with tractors and cause lot of traffic get on ground reality and then make decisions
this will help government propoganda of doubling farmers income by 2022
mla members posting lot of videos on this channel about bjp inc corruption but problem we do not have many followers on this platform increase awareness level we must have focus on increasing subscribers of this channel if we can comment on this channel why cannot we comment request on other channels subscribe yt channel if agree with me then question that arises how where we can request others subscribe this channel we can request subscribe this channel in different languages by sharing link we can target every news channel political party channel vlogs etc through emotional morally correct caption this way we can help this party grow across pan india
70 farmers lost their lives till now only intention of our current government make their corporate friends rich and common people suffer due unorganised lockdown on 22 march 2020 onwards major disaster for citizens of india modi already sold most government company his friends but modi forgot farming not business for farmers religion not for only farmers for all them who eat food today
why farmers vote for bjp farmers will continue their protest
no one can stop kisan specially punjabi jatt do not forget if there no punjabi sikh in army there no india
yr i am from pakistan but if i have any way come there then i will come there and support farmers i can feel their helplessness mr modi should listen them even they wrong they like ones who producing food but rather than appreciating them mr modi killing them
yaa i totally agree with and i raise question that this farmer protest not hindus or muslims protest brother muslim aur hindu can be farmer and allowed do protest maybe i am wrong so please correct me for this
election pass ana congress ko bas protest hi yad ata ha
which parties support farmers transparently in future my support those parties only jai sri ram
never seen these protests in any of msm in india not even in social media
government should fullfill all needs and aspirations of farmers of our country and then farmers will decide should implement or not
these not farmers they bloody goons who gave right rights beat someone death i think police should do much more
saw full video said farmers feeding water and food see videos today farmers beating crap of police
why have elections when we can frame laws or repeal from roads dissolve all parliament and let some brokers and opposition decide what do
finally our legend farmers won
do not blame farmers please do not scold farmers if we agree this farmers bill we will not get food for all farmers who lose their rights
one nation one election wrong right power of democracy being crushed tomorrow bjp will come up with one nation one party same as russia and china
this why i hate politics really dirty i just feel pity for farmers taking so much hardships if govt listen them this would nevr happen
was pdp nc congress which supported them not any action
i agree with rakesh tikait saheb
more power respect from pakistani punjab
modi ji all your good efforts being detailed by this gunda tikat
i do not have enough economic and farming acumen definitively have opinion on these bills but from this video its apparent neither does mr shekhar
in my opinion laws should have been withdrawn months ago because one can easily see that lakhs of people in guises of farmers have surrounded delhi and they were entrenched so much that they could have surrounded delhi for not only months but years together
do this bill have anything say about msp and view on mandi future legal existence
feel proud on farmers respect
totally misleading not small farmers but mostly middlemen who protesting
bill passed now they trying capture farmers attention for upcoming elections if they really oppose then why akali dal still with bjp
only print cannot see khalistan support in this woww
speaking reality not sure indian army can do what americans left incompleted one more thing though india capture afghanistan will bring only unwanted enemity with taliban and we may get hit by all three taliban pakistan and china simultaneously and not sure india can manage all these three if they join together
mam farmers old bill or acts exploitation h uspe videos bnaiye
1 did from now onward any system created any approach for poor farmer let grown crop be sold directly mall or supermarket chain
farmers everything please listen them
just majboori not beacuse farmers were protesting modi called them andholan jeevi bjp politicians called them khalistani
where our some farmers whom delhi police kidnapped
msp demand of all kisans kisan ekta zindabad skm great organization of kisans
rakesh tiketh ase chair nhi miegi neta banne
i think farmers deserve highest salary but this devasting know that they suffer most
irony fact that there draught places in india where water big commodity for farmers but govt cannot give them but when farmers protesting they have huge tankers may all farmers be blessed in this country kisaan hum
and everyone knows what happens in court when bjp in power and if farmer loses their land can they win against big corporate no way
support farmers and app party

thank so much sir now i have very clear idea on farmers bill thank
bjp should think about farm bill farmers will not bend at any cost farmers and soldiers cannot be forced bend and they pillars of our country
dhruv brother unaware of true facts initially all farmer union leaders decided perform tractor parade on ring road but later due unkown reasons they changed their decision on midnight of 25th january march on route given by delhi police this created confusion and anger among all protestors therefore people decided march on initial route against permission of delhi police from this can understand that deep sidhu and lakha sidhana were not responsible for any action but union leaders truly responsible coming towards red fort topic offense raise farmer flag and nishan sahib on empty pole where there was no tricolor at all legal in our constitution for rss raise their flag on red fort rules must be same for everyone moreover if say that red fort highly prestigious and respected site of india then okay for our pm sell this public property dalmia bharat group for span of 5 years in exchange of money mr rathee cannot prove farmers guilty and justify others without stating true facts now when decide make video on something please be aware of each and every fact and must provide every side of story
planned routes were not good those were outside capital and indian flag waiving at highest position moreover that flag not khalistani flag that nishan sahib and modi govt sold red fort private company dalmia but no one questions
bills made for people welfare but if farmers not satisfy then why government implement forcefully
i was big supporter of bjp but from now i will never vote bjp
excellent skm tikait supportive move resolve kisan andolan agendas in right direction zindabad
do not understand what farmers new law says
ex farmer minister of ncp and present congress chief minister of punjab also
tikait others do not go farmers committing suicide in maharashtra because not getting any fund for going there congress ruled state
also huge thing not able sue companies for not paying farmers all liability written out of bill this what killed sugarcane and other farming practices in punjab only rice and wheat now since they have msp and farmers dont get exploited by companies that have prime minister in there pocket
yar mitra chaudhary bano kren cancel horha caa nhi wapas lia aur accept pdega anti forces got successful in creating big confusion against govt election haar jane milega adha chzen compromise krni pdegi bada goal
cunning move by bjp with upcoming up elections in mind dangerous party for all working class people we should teach them lesson in elections like southern states tn and kerala
all farmers will stop protesting if govt announce minimum price of buying produce from farmers
v h achhe guys fighting not only for farmers but for india
hour back i switched on tv news channel where z news showing some mandir features other channel showing imran khan and pakistan and few more were showing indian army weapons and machinery as if everything perfect this sunday going perfect according tv point of view now seems pretty much clear how channels and shows plotted according type of ideology and convert your perception
please go through this article by ramesh inder singh mandher ias former chief secretary punjab govt understang whole issue related farmer protests may also like share with your friends and groups

we support farmers farmers feed food farmers now protest for every indian and indian future protect our farmers from sanghis

another argument against msp that there will be no buyers at that price food basic necessity for which there will always be buyers ultimate sale price always adjusts purchase price of item
superb reporting arfa ji stand with farmers
owners of agricultural land in punjab who have not set foot in india for
farmers just asking for certain assurances
this govt like tanasah we r children of farmers cannot tolerate stop modi 19
farm laws repealed so why will they will not continue protest thanks
congratulation all real farmers
but these laws were already introduced in abroad and proved be disastrous these laws also states that no tax needed be paid for private sector clearly indicates that should increase privatisation if privatisation introduced farmers prone be fooled by corporate companies whose agenda only profits as we know literacy rate of farmers comparatively low they will not be able understand company policy and conditions before signing any agreement in order protect our farmers i think government should be involved and help farmers through process
lastly msp reader needs understand that should be minimum base price that farmer should get not maximum and even if do not like msp atleast ask your mla that why products bought under msp prices savings not passed on maybe we need msp proce on each product instead of mrp show how much traders making on these goods
by remaining silent modi protected india from getting blacklisted
giving example of land acquisition bill depicts poor research behind this topic bjp had alternate bill where states were given power and most of nda states implemented and can check how much national highways airports sezs industry has been developed in bjp vs non bjp states
punjab saved indian democracy once again
thank for putting this out there and bringing awareness this issue indian farming community needs this and everyone support now more than ever

not because of elections that government took back laws but save country from anti indian parties
ha ha ha modi politics farmers laws had be deplyed in next term after 2024 muslims laws was enough for this term
ehhhh rest okay but kind of missed part where along with delaying government also offering amend certain portions of law according their demands they have organized 12 rounds of talks with farmers but farmers want complete repeal another thing background on need for these laws kind of scanty and maybe little too conveniently presented hope research more on and present another episode such partial evaluations build very ill informed and strong narrative which kind of sucks
can farmers stop work and how can we eat
this big win for farmers after almost year of protest and 700 deaths government was forced scrap farm laws

6 misguided or not kindly explain how service bound employed middle classes and small manufacturing businesses matter here how will they gain or lose through these new laws or they of no importance because they do not fit anywhere neither too rich nor too poor neither living on streets nor agricultural land owners neither jawan nor kisaan but important enough as voter due sheer number have pro and anti govt propoganda targeted at them does farmer give food free them will farmer not want msp be increased for himself even if at cost of retail price being increased for middle class consumers
similarly those states who do not like private players get united and boycott private players but farmers of other states who not protesting against law let them do farming in their own way
protest began since many days demanding for revoking farm laws which seen as curse more than boon by protesting farmers many lakhs of farmers came together with their tractors as symbol of farmers and marched toward capital intention of protesters was show that revoking of farm laws not demand of few but of majority who represented farmers of india

in india about 60 farmers that 700 800 million people in number about 2 million 350 400 times difference but can provide enough grain world market compete with india grain with same price if we use 2000 year average income in india assume india farmers can make that much by selling their products american farmers let say not 350 400 times difference but only 100 times difference american farmers can earn 200 000 year farmers got lots of benefit from government such as gasoline price when gas was 1 50 per gallon 4 liters price for farmers was 0 25 per gallon that 18 rupee per gallon or 4 25 rupee per liter can indian farmers get that price for gasoline gasoline in india now 102 rupee per liter

long live farmers
i wonder if farmers have considered making national union so they can all agree on minimum prices that theyll sell markets its possible that companies could try and buy crops from other countries but i reckon theyd eventually cave due transportation costs
mr modi how can unequivocally decide repeal these bills without parliaments voting isnt india parliamentary democracy and not dictatorship and by way who tapasya another name for anjana om modi
just farmers of 3 states were protesting and i womder they so poor that they could fund protests for one year they essentially intermediaries and treaders who could not see they commission going away there lots of small farmers benefited from this but no no no why do we focus on positive till negative news can help earn trp indian problems uniquely indian and western countries cannot do much except spreading their version and possibly defame other countries remember they were reforms and leaders of so called protests were supporting initially until they saw political opportunity

what i have never heard or read about these farms laws how many farmers were opposing and how many supported there was no proper statistics and mostly saw centrist or leftist channels promoting agitation if these laws were so popular then why there were no support rallies or cry now from farmers who were in favor of these laws also if more farmers were supporting then modi just gave them big slap on their face
jai kissan bastards raised hands against farmers who were trying stop ruling party leaders police bjp assets

this policy part of wef reset goal remove ownership of land from farmers by forcing prices down for crop well done them for their hard resilient attitude
3 farmers unions can help farmers negotiate with companies if laws can include better support for farmers unions maybe that should be done
dear aim pls suggest what modi should have done so called kishan agitation saying govt should do something like 100 flower campaign or straight forward send tanks demolish road block shed all around delhi may call me bhakt but i would like remind statement of ram jathmalani about pappu so do not call one pappu out side and another inside jai hind vandematram
thank so much for awaring people some indians even call farmers terrorist this worst we just wants our rights

without msp farming will become unviable and most of produce imported from international market in cheaper price this will make dependent on foreign countries and in war situation we get destroyed msp very important for food security

farmers should not be swerved by fake swallow promises of govt those farmers lost their lives in due course of farmers agitation their relatives must be duly compensated
big thanks lots of farmers dies while protest big relief farmers and govt has saved many farmers live and given great happiness for their struggle and hope such laws wil never be implemented in future due which our people die
my opion that agricultre basic education and medicine should be untouched by corporates so that public gets these at least price and farmers get minimum support price
farmers do not need degree for
we educated well meaning young indians with sentiment of giving back our communities must upon ourselves spread awareness and help our farmers improve their agricultural practices as well as incomes through appropriate leveraging use of new technology and connectivity
we love our farmers agar nhi hm nhi
farmers being called terrorist khalistani and whatnot by these top notch media houses
and second more important fact notice india ever falling global hunger index rank if these laws will be implemented major portion of indias society will fall in poverty and hunger striken due increased prices of food and no subsidized crops
u r only voice that stands for farmer from starting of this protest
nothing gonna happen majority of people in india support farming reforms if these reforms implemented then 2 decade stagnant agriculture sector will once again grow
its test of time for these 3 bills whether will wrong opposition or will turn out be another type of demonetisation i really wish these reforms overcome all myths and help farmers
that means clear that knowingly tikait invited nihang sikh use them as weapon against govt so that they can wash their hands from any violence putting blame on other head very smart tikait only politicians do this cunning plan not farmers
modi shame on hope get pain giving farmers
what about farmers who lost their lives those who work for goons
we rushed justice only when we victims its not just thing of farmers includes all common people no matters which religion cast they belongs
simple changes brought by this bills there another market available besides mandis
rest in peace all farmers we lost
fact that farm laws promotes inequality then how can say that they good for farmers
short answer capitalists became feudalists and farmers protest becoming their peasants
modi bowing farmers protest against law which was claimed be very help ful farmers good precedent modi haters lobby and celebrate heavy insult genuine farmers who were appreciating law
sekhar i am sorry for that these farm laws have been repealed i knew always supported these laws sympathies

sir i understood point that government cannot procure all food produce from all farmers across country but if govt makes law by which procurement of agricultural produce below msp by any private party would not be accepted then storage issue can be sorted out by doing inflation will certainly happen but by this lowest strata of economy will get benefit in terms of money this will be biggest tool for poverty alleviation ruling government should also consider this point

government should think about in favor of farmers as they our food god
i do not agree protest for political reasons law worded very cleverly how government will implement them that why farmers protesting
salute all my farmers and everyone who showed faith in farmers
ppl of punjab had created serious security threat for country hence govt had repeal law
democracy works both ways citizens should not bully their way either happened with jaat protests and their unfair demands happened with farmer protests too go ask daily commuters of delhi ncr who being harassed in name of peaceful protests and now that laws being repealed politically ambitious takait making unfair demands much like jaat protests and will continue harass daily commuters death of democracy indeed
this farmers protest will bring down modi government government should stop showing favouritism adani and ambani this will be bjp waterloo mr modi very much required be in center as we have two hostile neighbours china and pakistan only modi can stop them so please solve this farmers protests asap drop all ego and find solution with these so called farmers if they do not farm then there will be shortage of food
huh so remember when modi was praised as fighting for people of india like trump lol
as australian farmer and also australian was only 35 years ago that we were classed as developing economy then government had idea float dollar and open up markets moment that set price on heads of sheep was removed price shuttered then nose dived same thing happened with cattle and with wine grapes we wanted establish wine industry they gave wine growers something like 10 years of price guarantee as well as subsidies get vineyards established but moment government set minimum price was pulled prices plummeted not because wineries could not afford but because they seen opportunity make more money on their end and essentially shafting wine grape growers by paying almost 1 5 of price worst hit was probably wool industry practically overnight prices per bale dropped and all of sudden when factoring futures farmers ended up owing money on their stock
when there issues regarding economy then rural consumption have come rescue of our economy whether govt were aware of this fact when farmer bills ordinance were introduced
great enemy of indian farmers mr tikait
8 07 and that specific issue here punjabi farmers agree they want be showered with freebies and be spoonfed subsidies for growing crops that always bought at loss by government using taxpayer money
humble request farmers stop protest
b indian government bjp and farmers
this type of same farm policy followed by china vietnam and thailand and they exporting more if they doing good if india doing then bad
reforms do not address basic agrarian problems and address only trading contract farming and stock hording they lay down legal regime create completely unregulated and taxation free private markets in competition with existing apmc mandis which subject taxes creating unequal playing field in favour of corporates
aree goid media yrr modi puchu west bengal me social distancing
these type of people should be in jail for misguiding poor innocent farmers
already 94 of famers do not have any govt msp support even after 55 years since green revolution and now saying that this figure just be reduced 0 and no of mandis should be increased 7 times their current numbers
ppl should explan farmers which good for farmers
only one agenda for bjp that communal politics and anyone speaking against labeled congress leftist etc etc supporter cant blame them they cant see beyond political factions becoz they suffering from mental myopia which weak far sight vision there indians here not all running political agenda when they stand against dictatorship that controlling and destroying nation in every way possible
they not farmers

wht happened intellectuals why they not saying death of farmers will benefit one party
now bjp has lost patience this not good news basically in haryana
okay so basically i support modi and i dont need give reason cuz its just politics yk
there no problem in new bills but problem lies in their implementation governments have been making these tyoes of reforms from ages there nothing new in these reforms but practical implementation of these reforms never took place nearly 85 farmers did not get their msp price because of corruption and loop holes in government policies now these reforms looks very good on paper but how benefitted they will be farmers only time will tell
mr rathee can explain why those bills were not in favour of all indian farmers not particular segment of society opposing party not bad but opposing decision which could bring prosperity farmers irony
if indeed read all comments please make one correction taxes in apmc mandis not paid by farmer paid by buyer
seems that today best day of our life victory of farmers and parkash utsav of sri guru nanak dev ji but still i will not vote for bjp for experienced achhe din
thanks for covering indian farmers
government destroying both farmers and soldiers
wow our bjp government pass 15 bills in 2 days and all opposition was absent and totally undemocratic
i have no words express my respect n gratitude for farmers and also schoopwoop for showing reality being agri student from punjab i can understand their demand agriculture backbone of economy n only field that has shown positive growth during these times they farmers not terrorist dont torture them like that
national average rs10 000 but state average income in punjab rs18000 i pretty sure also remember many small land owner farmers will not be able sustain family of 3 or more no matter what no where in world msp exists kids of farmers need study and engage in other income sources if land small we already get subsidized seeds fertilizers electricity and often loan waivers
so this bill will not add value in farmers pocket as we learnt rather increase income of corporate which okay if both party in win win situation
sarkar raj dialogue for u p election
repealing of farm laws not solution this problem farmers will continue suffer many reforms in farm bills very much required in our country should be done in decentralised way according need of particular state
these bills for corporate not farmers

i do not understand that point why farmers sell middle man when msp higher than market rate i understand that only few people get sell through msp because of storage issue but i do not understand other reason why they those products market when msp higher than market rate i assume that farmers do not have clear idea of rates that prevailing
man who puts farmers orange flag on pole has now become legend
modi going enact national security law against these farmer protests as china ccp did hongkong protests
government surrender small group of corrupt middlemen has set template that would now be used for every progressive reforms that india needed and i personally felt very sad way our prime minister narendra modi apologised even for such revolutionary reforms in field of farming and heartfelt condolences for such real farmers who really in need for such laws
country with our farmers prosperous farmers will make prosperous india money in hands of adani ambani will only leave country because they shop abroad our farmers will buy indian and boost our economy
farm laws may be good for farmers according u but still in real life there no guarantee all i know that all past reforms of modi government have failed miserably
godi media trying protect bjp
this lecture was splendid sir cleared all doubts our and i fully respect of farmers and
ur video just like small packet big bang really make my all concepts related this farm bill clear nd also make me able ponder about reasons why farmers protesting
have explained bang on i also liked how farmer speculation cannot be underestimated i would just add one more spectrum which missed no farmer happy selling on msp nothing but bare minimum govt discounts final price by survey committees before declaring in msp
imagine foreign media outlet giving more information about indian issue than our own media
i am also farmer and my son will also be farming here we had been deprived of our right due few agents and middle men and when now govt has steps curb that and help western media guys spreading lies and hate among and dividing watch there in your land for next farmer protest and has begun now in germany beware we coming

bringing down our tricolor flag in republic day not acceptable whether may be farmer or nothing else now whole india will understand who they what they trying do what they did now their slogans was nt related farmer protest
i am frightened for all law abiding citizens and for those who do not support modi shah bjp because they have criminals heading meetings for nation
instead of stopping new farm bill for 18 months let farmers experience new farm bill for 18 months and side by side committee form bring any amendment if needed on experience of farmers then farmers will release that new farm bill in there favours let kotak securities kotak bank open 3 in 1 account of farmers i e demat trading bank account also teach farmers how export agro products of export quality skill development under kotak bank global trade account for exporters small marginal big farmers all over india farmers will have 2nd line of income support while getting benefit of 2nd line of income they can provide food grains of good quality
i think bjp ministers have learned something from salman khan but as its india no action will be for these criminals everything sold in this country police plays important role in covering up these crimes lets see how judiciary handle these cases now
kisan deshdrohi aur media deshpremi wa wa dirty politics

increasing number of respiratory diseases and deaths in delhi and other north indian cities will show why these laws were necessary one of 3 laws was against stubble burning
if i not mistaken led large scale famines in india because food did not end up where was most needed but rather where could fetch highest price because of large scale traders
more power farmers
i have read about bill all three of them and i see that bills only give farmers right trade with private corporations directly without middlemen mandi now this in no ways means that farmers will not get msp they can still sell mandis at msp price so all their choice
good job they not farmers goons

this protest started by farmers of india reason for this protest govt declared law agriculture section normally our farmers sell their products through apmc market apmc market market there minimum selling price given farmers from elderly so that farmers can sell their products through apmc market and will get minimum selling price or more than that buyer have pay tax for products they bought aim of apmc market getting minimum selling price farmers every farmers starts there production by taking loans from someone they very poor peoples many were suicides because of price for there product getting very low new law of our uneducated and worst prime minister of indian history honarable prime minister mr modiji and their party that they giving permission corparates companies buy products from farmers and sell buyers normally not problem but thing buyer did not want pay tax for buying from corparates in apmc they nave pay taxes and corparates did not maintain minimum selling price for farmers so people will go corparates because there no tax payment and apmc market will fall down and farmers did not get minimum price so suicidal attempt of farmers will not stops and that will go on apmc market also govt property modi govt supporting only corparates because they funders of modi political party bjp so has work accornding corparates democracy equality and every thing gone away by idian citizen
punjab ex cm captain has advised our pm after up and punjab elections farm laws will be back
wait minute car windshield and back part already damaged before hitting people how possible if car wind shield damaged then driver not able see people means car already damaged by farmers can anyone notice that

kisan will always get loss in future because bill can make him strong
those who now saying that laws were reformist and would benefit farmers never said so previously now that they have been back they saying was good but government did not get all stakeholders on board would any opposition parties ever have agreed laws even with modifications
i support farmers they have every right protest and democracy joke in india national media sponsored by government ambani adnani private players whom govt favours and modi clown who responsible for this mess
sir i watched your video since long time but tell me if farmer of mp will sell his grown in rajasthan so who gives his transprting cost
2 things 1 deceiving title didnt say sorry for farm bills but only for fact that wasnt able make stubborn people understand
msp benefits only punjab and haryana farmers 94 of farmers who mostly depend on rain have no guarantee but punjab and haryana where water abundant have guaranteed 50 profit due msp which leads over production of wheat and rice while we importing pulses and many expensive grains treat all farmers equally and show more care on vulnerable farmers who in lakhs commit suicide
no godi media will show this
as literature student i would like add that fears of our farmers part of traditional folklore folk belief if look at folklore from any agricultural communities find atleast one villain who seth zamindar sahukar extorting poor farmer peasant laborer this had amplified during colonial era with horrific famines and almost 200 tax so when nationalist movement invited farmers join protest gained nationalist color as farmers from across country came together this narrative was recalled during jai jawan jai kisan era and during various cpi movements in bengal and kerala so was only natural that when farmers were told that they will directly deal with buisnessmen they panicked its almost krishna kans dichotomy
modi governments very very good decision now farmer have concentrate on organic farming
action against terrorists
recent agriculture reforms would benefit both consumers and farmers in coming years and expects wastage in sector drop from here on said agriculture can become one of largest value added exports of india
i support gov they came up with very good bill

yogendra yadav top farmer and middle man of year 2021 without owning farm and getting money from china
ndtv farmers hero and victims true

farmers want under middle man control
funny 25 28 years ago i studied in my social text books about middlemen msp and warehouses not being available for farmers just around when dhruv was born my friends and relatives farmers and in 2021 same people who did not do much for farmers since indpndmce giving gyan in such videos pappus very ignorant about what happened in this country since independence on ground across states and who culprits people here hardly know about farming and challenges across country
we support our farmers godi media go hell
farmers carry seeds and fertilizer farmers do not carry swords iron rods stones only rioters and hooligans carry swords
1 farm bills hampers with monopoly of apmc agricultural produce market committee mandis for many established middlemen this came as sudden shock
i totally understood what modi said from today onwards i will totally not buy anything from rich kisan one state and buy from poor kisan of every state of india
problem with india that we got democracy before we got enlightenment unless india develops into market economy we will continue remain poor thats fact reforms not pleseant or easy however good things rarely if farmers win and get their way all they would be doing kicking can down road if we dont reform now we will be forced accept reforms later on agricultural productivity in punjab haryana has been lagging behind other states where reforms were brought in furthermore no country state can be rich when 50 of population works in agriculture low value added sector india needs incentivize subsidize business and corporations so that people can find employment in other sectors advanced countries have over 95 percent of population working in non agricultural sectors our people immigrate western countries that have capitalist system and yet when they look at india somehow they want remain socialist
rock on farmers
when comes farmers there no support except paltry alm of rs 6000 or 8000 per year
its not about aspirations of farmers rather about interests of their exploiters and political manipulators goverment not wrong but needs communicate with farmers convince them and redress their genuine grievances if any
police should stand down let public face farmer protesters leaders politicians who protesting disrupting traffic creating ruckus violence etc let public feel brunt they will then action against these fools and support police
1st sushant then farmer law
lol if india army intervenes taliban would be wiped out of this world in one day
if police real son of farmer should remove uniform and join protest
and still people think farmers right
sudden change now during pandemic without first consulting farmers has led serious lack of faith
but what about states like bihar where no apmc and they get nearly 30 less price then apmc
farm law cancelled by modi bjp government
apmc stands for agricultural produce marketing committee and not agricultural price marketing committee
as per crpc one can direct break farmers head
buyers shall be passed through proper channel before they could actually buy crop from farmer as non legitimised buyer can commit frauds with farmers by not paying them money as of today licensed buyers have deposit bank guarantee in apmcs so payment of farmer secured
although i do not support aimim but question has raised genuine one why media and people of our country do not understand that india middle man between taliban and usa and they were in every meeting almost held in doha between taliban and usa can check in internet recently indian delegation met taliban in doha can we deny
we win farmers win
sir i would recommend make this episode in hindi also so that farmers also can understand and can come out of any narrative trap
then who will get ressponsbilty death of farmer and what compensations
now know who will be happy certain sections who feels threaten by bjp who at heads of social medias news channels bollywood bosses and who have friends with political dynasties shame that certain families ruling and heading all political parties n they deciding fate of billions of people same families ruling generations after generation do u actually call democracy india need only one party without any dynasty just like china politicians should be selected on basis of their performance there should be no religion cast but that will sadly not happen
how can police personal ordered his team crack head of farmers and due which one farmer died was notorious activity done by haryana police with support of cm haryana and back support of modi shah shameful for our democratic country
these three farm reforms were hope for but due bullies of certain section of farmers we will again be rotten in old system of agriculture
if rich farmers not happy with new policies but poor farmers that means modi policies good
from what i saw this just any other bill where some would agree and some would disagree and problems could have been solved by proper discussions which have been happening there was no need go completely pro govt or anti government as these media houses have done
plz make vedio on current farmers protest again
farmers were crushed death bjp workers were beaten death matter closed
farm laws not cruel but they good for farmers
4 no mechanism for price fixation crucial recognize price formation not fixation takes place due interaction of demand and supply in market wider market greater competition and lesser market margins of intermediaries and farmer assured of greater share of consumer income allowing buyers outside apmc mandis in market promotes competition and halts exploitation at present while consumers paying higher price farmers still receiving lower price due inefficiencies and imperfections setting markets right crucial through new laws ump unified market platform in karnataka e nam resulted in increase of prices by 38
everyone talking about protests no one talking about laws currently we have soviet inspired system where we can sell our produce mostly in mandis or traders roaming around buying perishable products for cheap rates which often leads not getting enough or stable profit if we can sell outside mandi food processors income will become much more stable commission cuts by middle men and tax applied on mandis can also be realized ensuring more income there acute shortage of storage facilities in india because of restrictions on storing in new laws these restrictions will be removed bring investment in developing storage facilities store them in times of bumper harvests also contract farming ensures fixed earning before contract so one can decide india was made socialist republic in 1975 and by help of movies and propaganda companies made look like looters ensuring that there can be know public investment these changes large change being tried introduced by previous gov since 1990 but because farmers form 50 of working population in india no one had courage do so and fear psychosis being multiplied through hatred for businessmen capitalism at bay but how much try only way lift people out of poverty capitalism after country becomes rich can collect taxes from richest facilitate for poor but by discouraging free trade ensuring poverty forever
this what happens when put uncivilized people in charge of nation they have never learnt follow rules modi cares about bjp first then about country needs those funds through those electoral bonds fight elections this bill what corporates get in exchange for those juicy bonds
today farmers lost and spineless opposition won modi government wanted help farmers but opposition fooled uneducated farmer and now foolish farmer celebrating on their own death that india fit be slaves
jay jawan jay kisan cat out of box advice fool bjp politicians like khattar and mishra from lakhimpur can fool all people some of time and some of people all time but cannot fool all people all time give msp farmers jay hind bharat mata jay jay shree ram

what solution india too diverse and too big be run on centralized policies centralized policies will not have same effect in all parts of india that why even proponent of centralized policies agriculture as state subject decentralization of power and policies and mandatory and accountable agricultural ministry in each state can solve most problems related sustainability of agriculture but if govt wants continue current policies of favoring donor class of big corporations then they should start putting money away for building massive prisons and concentration camps crush and exploit huge population of poor indians join club of such economic conglomerates in world i doubt that even modi who cruelest leader after aurengzeb in history of india has guts repeat trail of tears
we support farmers
2 just becoz there personal relation between farmer and agent who helps them financially when situation demands why they need demand for repeal this applicable only punjab and haryana there farmers in other parts of india
though china isnt happy with aggression and expansionist policy of india we still support grass root indians fight for their rights jai hind

explanation beautiful overall but reality harsher than this beautiful explanation loop holes that have been pointed out in this video or actually there in farm acts dangerous indeed acts appear be cake walk while reading and listening explanations but while analysing whole act appears be masterstoke with disastrous loop holes i would suggest viewers refer other sources as well along with this amazing video govt should not withdraw this act but should amend largely and in any case hoarding not justifiable just shows potrays govt on side of big corporates rather than poor consumer and farmers suggestions given by vikas sir also must needed amendments in whole act but still there many more loop holes and even more dangerous possible harm in this act that could be happened farmers so those drawbacks also need be addressed and amended by govt

current trend of deregulating markets in particular allowing wholesale buyers of commodities like rice and sorghum avoid minimum prices msp as prescribed by law will make already dire predicament of farmers much worse these farmers that protest have no choice but protest against unsound and harmful neoliberal policies pushing for deregulation at this point they have little nothing lose history shows revolution like gravity when conditions right all takes slightest push off sadly most governments at that point incapable of seeing problem since they created india like could be on cusp of revolution thought 2020 was bad 2021 will be lot hotter

i know that apposite of farmers but i want tell something if see my comment so reply me why farmers protesting if 90 farmers apposite of this new farming bills so why government doing that if farmers saying that they have problem with this law so government should withdraw law also understand that farmers not crazy who have been protesting in cold for almost 2 months everyone has right live their life additionally people select government not government if farmers want these laws be repealed then what problem goverment should appriciate them so that farmers can return their homes and they can sleep peacefully in their homes this law has already failed for example farmers in bihar they stuck in this law and they come punjab every year for work i hope can understand
there some loopholes but this new bill progressive step for indian farmers but they need be educated about this correctly as opponents misleading them as they always do

thanks india today plzz support and show more about farmer protest without bollywood we live but without farmer we do not eating food
there still some misguided one saying these farmers not well informed about these new laws
after all this how these people rally behind them eg so many people have come noise airport opening of election gimmick
this bill not good for farmer only beneficial for middle man big farmers not for small farmers those who in favour of this law my request them please watch search information of bill then will understand benefit for farmer or not we support farmers
only congress for true indians
farmer farmer irrespective from which state they come and serve with one motive feed country
because growth typically means increasing efficiency so by that justification farmer in 2020 should have better modern technology than one in 1972 and corn yield produces today should ideally be higher and per kilo price can either be same or less because now has more yield also with newer technology should be diversifying his crops because ideally lot of farm work automated by machines and has more time
5 in existing apmc system mandatory for farmers go through trader mandis so as sell their produce consumers and companies and they receive msp minimum selling prices for their produce was this very system that has influenced riseto cartel led by traders and uncompetitive markets due which farmers paid lower prices than msp set by govt for their produces so in way these farm bills will destroy monopoly of govt run markets ie apmc
why farmers of states other than punjab hariyana western up were not agitating against these new laws
court police power dominate hindu but for rakesh tikait everything possible in riad
opposition party does not care for farmers
middlemen funding this opposition they must be paying out politicians save their monopolies imagine someone in orrisa purchasing and getting product shipped from punjab open trade good for everyone including farmer someone should educate middlemen that this will open up their client base entire country
farmer brothers and sisters
print shekar gupta anti modi and we should reject print because all his staff tutoring for congress
india too emotional of country progress east asia was willing knuckle down and absorb pain for advancement indians feel entitled everything these farmers believe government must guarantee them livelihood its terrible message show that protest will lead results violent protest must be crushed incentives matter yet india only rewards bad behaviour mughals can knock down temples while hindus cannot attain back through democratic process but caa gets stopped by protest
2nd bill for everybody not only for farmers middlemen final beneficiary of this bill because farmers do not have that much storage facilities but middlemen have
govt cannot and should not buy all farmers produce as they do not have money for that nor they require infact govt should completely stop procurement of agri produce and stop distorting market mechanism what demanded in market farmers should produce that cannot simply produce something and expect govt buy all currently indian farmers oblivious market demand if contract farming comes they can fix selling price with purchasers before cultivation
just hurts seeing indians fighting against each other and at that time when we shall show our maximum support our nation

government approach cut off various middle men links that exists in country because supplies reguated at least twice before reaching city or town markets different tiers of middle men create their own profit which indeed exploits original prices which earned by farmers if laws will cut out these men then most probably farmers can earn better prices but implementation sparkled protests because many of these farmers who out here protesting themselves part of local trade links or have not clearly understood government plan also i personally think because congress political party has funded punjab farmers as punjab congress state and party have influence there simply defame bjp central government and as can see protesters all punjabis and not even single person can be seen who not punjabi
approach towards farmers shocking
mitron jumla feku modi bowed down khalistanis farmers laws be repealed sabka sabka vikas all bakwas only vinaaash
farmers protesting farm bill not only sikhs in punjab and haryana there hindu farmers sikh farmers muslim farmers in punjab and haryana farmers not only from jatt caste or sikhs there also pundits brahmins and dogar farmers in punjab farmers feed nation big companies like tata birla reliance abany adnany these big companies controlling modi these bills designed make each farmer compete against each other so that big companies can buy crops at lowest rate because farmers will have no option sell another buyer due logistics and resources and big companies have logistics and they will buy at lowest cost from farmers and export other countries this will cause food shortage in india because big companies will be able export crops more profitable buyers in other countries and food prices will get more expensive in india modi working for business tycoons and big companies gst hurting small shops small factories and modi needs be removed from his throne

india supports punjab farmers farm laws benifit reliance ambani
unity strength punjab haryana showed world
cell sanghis trying hard mislead people about agitation of farmers they portrayed farmers from punjab as khalistan terrorists on social media
if government has followed practice for 60 years and knows that theres extra or oversupply of these grains then has be government which has handhold farmer change crop pattern like incentive being given by haryana government away from what government asked farmer begin with initially in 1960s overcome food shortages rightfully successive governments should have begun this around time oversupply began like earlier pu had lot of maze oil seeds etc down but they changed crop pattern wheat rice as government wanted this be done with water table receding oversupply of some crops vis vis under supply of other crops we now importing therefore successive governments should have by now begun incentivise farmer crops which in short supply with assured msp and their procurement in few years farmers would develop confidence and equilibrium would be reached in crop diversification
perfectly said got scared of losing votes in coming elections of punjab and u p in 2022 that reason why said like this

honestly i do support indian farm workers due issue in which they facing similar what happened in mexico in 1994 in when corrupt president of pri got elected proposed privatization in which his administration cut down on subsidies on small farm workers collected up small plots of land and sold them private corporations and help corporations control of farmland this types of policies were disastrous in mexico due food prices rose dramatically inflation became extremely high farm worker produced and was struggling lot more and lot more mexican farm workers fled i hope indian farm workers get these types of laws removed due privatization bad and important sectors like farming should be by people not by corporations

trump supporters media has left wing bias
fact that most of them not farmers but rather landlords
shame on bjp calling farmers terrorists and person killing farmer their mp time overthrow bjp
sir best scenario more govt mandies closer farmers guaranteed msp guaranteed procurement of atleast 23 farm produce which already there on paper this not only reassuring farmers but at same generates more employment opportunity due more mandies govt can use part of produce distribute pds ration shops meet govt social obligation which also govt can use as assured vote bank of poor balance of farm produce procured stored may be sold pvt players at higher rates for them add value sell at good profits this will be win win for all stake holders

1 companies can lure farmers for contract farming resulting in excessive use of pesticides and promoting mono cropping which bad for ecosystem as well as fertility of soil

i am guessing but i think government should protect its farmers from capitalism food non negotiable so many factors affect farming so losing this sector of economy death whole country stand strong or food prices will escalate beyond peoples income even in europe we subsidise farmers food life how can government be so stupid i know gmo follow money people
so now its final that few sections of farmers will enjoy their benefit more like they were middle man who used exploit small farmers they will continue do so
yes give 42lakh subsidy farmers like in usa and bring new law if really want follow foreign countries follow everything not just part of what they do
idiotic expression by expert why farmers of other states committing suicide
shameless protests costing national economy tractors must be used only in farm lands not in posh roads need strong disciplined judiciary

in case of industry in some cases government gives land industry but farmer can not purchase land beyond land celing 12 5 acres in up even from his own money
govt says agitation by rich farmers with agricultural land ceiling laws in all states i do not see how there rich farmers will somebody explain why msp about which govt willing give written assurance cannot be given statutory sanction
i support farmers
well shorten case laws of mandi will remain intact new laws for something outside mandis if farmers skilled enough produce quality food then instead of minimum selling price msp they can sell corporates or restaurants through contracts like those done in commodity markets and new laws putting these corporates and restaurants or any other bidder pay farmers and obey contract so these laws just another option and that does not banish mandis option
dont aspect any thing positive from bjp and modiji

rakesh talking about poors from villeges cities metros farmless farmers agnoy rakesh going distribute his extra land landless farmers
govt should let states decide whoever wants these laws implement southern states of india much more educated and people has progressive mindset in that part of india let punjab and haryana do not implement laws
but china in your country farmers will not be allowed
same thing done in kashmir we call them terrorism we feel pain of farmers kisan zindabad
food life from simple seed healing begins for india your lucky have modi now treat him good and have modi for long life iamiam iamjohn
sdm ordering crush heads of farmers how this legal should be put behind bars immediately
do producers of this video know about three laws do they know about history of agriculture do they know that many economists have come in support of laws do they know that some farmer unions happy with new laws do they know that symbol of indian democracy was attacked do they understand gravity of situation imagine capital of nation has been blocked by road on all sides do they know about effect of protest on economy of border communities
saying that more than 340 cops injured i also condemn that and i am also agree that violence bad but what about lives of those 70 farmers who lost their lives during protest who responsible for that
that means these laws were not in favor of farmers and were implemented just like that what message nation should from extremely confusing
i feel ashamed that people in order support party defend brutal killing of farmers today video has surfaced where can be clearly seen that two cars were too fast and farmers had no time react they r depressed and now if this happen then riots will place out of anger
question that why bihari farmer still poorest in india even though they under new laws since 2006 and these same laws as passed by bjp last year
i guess not because farm bill only choice provided farmer either sell apmc or any private player preamble of bill here farmer made king n not blood sucking middlemen
i always stand with farmers hatss off all supporters and remaining bhagwaan sadbudhi
i always stand with farmers
there no sense of msp minimum support price unless there mqs minimum quality standard

violence was wrong but before licking rss boot do remember tamil farmer protest did they got solution
regarding farmers can go any state for selling their product as per new bill but most of farmers cant afford go same state different cities then how they can go other cities
hooligans not farmers protesting in most non violent way possible our national flag was desecrated totally unacceptable indulge in arson rioting and waging war against nation
95 of them did not even read farm laws i was watching news in morning when news channel was covering mahapanchayat sonia mann leading activist in farmer protest and punjabi actress when reporter asked her do have read farm laws immediately got hesitated and gave improper answers and spitted rubbish there government giving opportunities farmers sell their crops wherever they want not just in mandis if they get more price for that crop outside mandis they can sell them and as government already said msp will remain as then government will buy from at msp if would not get affordable price anywhere i comment this also on her sonia mann post on instagram after sometime deleted my comment
farmers real heros

god bless u for gr8 cooperation farmers n also thankful for respect of punjabi relationship
apmc act farmers were compelled sell only at apmcs licensed traders remember license permit quota raj
so there were many many loopholes in farm bill farmers well educated than prime minister
there no difference between modi govt and talibans
apmc penetration more in punjab and haryana more govt procurement impact of abolition of apmc monopoly in bihar not comparable punjab and haryana because of different administrative capacities of these state further fertilizer subsidy water subsidy and assured price for last 50 years assuring both cost and benefit and expecting gain in efficiency not farming but rent seeking impact of these policy have been grave on sustainability of water table and impact on air pollution further has distorted market supply from demand and available resources at hand these benefits comes out of pockets of hard earning individuals of this nation further we have many times higher production of rice and wheat than what we eat as nation why not fear of adani or ambani but simple market forces of demand and supply and farmers of other states getting at with farmers of punjab just compare per capita of punjab with other agricultural dependent state
that guy literally smacked person on his head with stick these people farmers my foot i just cant believe didnt feel anything while doing and rakesh tiket and other political leaders happily ignore this shame on all of them they should rot in hell
bjp father brother sister in laws sons sisters grandfather brother name zee news

rogues in farmer guise giving excuse for violence they committed and their crude argument that they waited for two months for govt give in their demands since govt did not relented they rightfully indulged in violence and shown disrespect indian tricolour because they ran out of patience now here my counter argument first farm law was passed following all legal processes of law in parliament if law passed by parliament cannot be implemented than where sanctity of parliament will set bad example and raise questions on functionality of parlimentary democracy and constitution itself 2nd still govt had shown sincerety resolve issues by holding many rounds of talk with so called farmer leaders so govt did best resolve issue 3rd no one has right disrespect national flag by bringing down national flag and putting something else in its place and that too when nation celebrating republic day clear now anti nationals disguised as farmers not interested in any resolution their only purpose weaken nation and govt and push ahead their own anti national agendas camouflaged as farmer movement govt of india should strong steps against such anti nationals and govt display its strong resolve not give in blackmailing and pressure tactics of anti nationals assisted abetted and fueled by inimical forces both inside and outside country
government will repeal all 3 farm laws in parliament winter session
have done great job of providing true image of this movement by bringing history of farmers and highlighting government authoritarian agenda overall
this time we watch tractor rally of farmers real republic day rally
greed of politicians and business heads create clash between security forces and simple people including farmers
one year wasted for farm laws only about 8 of indian farmers attended this agitation that only punjab and haryana maharastra karnataka mp kerala tn up goa wb other states 5 farmers not participated punjab farmers only in india nothing but silly politics both sides lost nothing and gain nothing

i farmer also we need change
these black farm laws against consumers harmful farmers as well as consumers
hindustan me taliban 25 crore supporters
fantastic farmers
jai ram these govt only thinks about caste votes modi ji planned so well in these farmers bills how make happy india crores bussiness mans and underground mafia who planned this bill
modi ji come and have debate on with ravish u will come know what did always u alone speaks let ravish ji get chance speak
these farmers should flee country until learns lesson
pakistanis support farmers movement more power our sikh brothers and sisters oppression has end
do not blame farmers some of them anti social elemnts
i support farmers jai hind
so said that taliban have no access their foreign currency right now so my question what if china will help them and fund them or russia because these countries ruled by totalitarian regimes and these regimes would want have ally like taliban i guess so not hard guess that these countries will do whatever they have do have another ally against west
now those farmers should protest who wants pass these bills not only farmers i think everyone who supported these bills should come forward and stop this repealing of bills
legal what will happen if repeal bill does not get majority
seems for moment good decision from electrol perspective but how long reforms going getting stalled like this especially when this issue only related vested interest of some section of one state or rich section belonging one caste and rest of india not much worried or rather its more of beneficial law let me ask question why particular state or caste needs be silent by feeding with money that can be spend for greater good for country especially this will impact only middleman and so called farmers will be still under their control and their own fate other states have shown better results and moved forward every law needs be discussed and gov used opportunity bypass parliament i believe government did give enough explanation in parliament and most political parties have this reform as part of their manifesto no one have guts implement l can understand if related land reforms or if impacts regional linguistic or cultural aspects or major constitutional amendments except for 370 and 371 of this nation that definitely needs wider discussion and more careful analysis even law that has wider implications was passed without much deliberation or less discussion ie nep so according sekhar sir logic any law that impacts punjab or haryana or western up needs be discussed explicitly discussed in parliament and rest fine or can be ignored sorry i do not this point may be bit harsh but fact
very good for farmers jai hind jai bharat
these were seperatists clip if nishad there exclusively mention of sikhon ko maarne not farmers
when left taliban unstable after collapse of ussr and did not its promises as usual taliban launched terrorist attacks against western countries and 9 11 was result of those unsettled promises after 9 11 america again invaded afghanistan with its military power and after 20 years of long war america made afghanistan restless so what has been achieved in 20 years
they not farmers they all gundas govt should action against them danda lekker pardarshan kerta
nice could have also talked about why protest were carried out by predominantly punjabi farmers and not farmers from southern or eastern states
government doing this not benefit farmers but pay back corporates who have funded election rallies and mla mp purchases otherwise government has no incentive meddle in subject which comes under state list
sorry but i cant stop crying opposition and wealthy farm leaders will be punished by god but modi will also be punished as chose party over nation
govt of india responsible for tht not farmers
we proud vegetarians and yet ran over farmers who grew our vegetables
we too farmers 90 farmers with govt
each state govt should document successful progressive farmers and these farmers can be used for handholding of rural unemployed youth
7 28 farmer pays back money borrowed with interest who takes interest from their own family sounds like business relationship me but i understand that farmers have no other avenue for such loans by way what interest rates these personal relations charge farmers not mentioned hmmm
there another loophole with msp my thoughts plz enlighten if otherwise msp encourage farmers grow specific crops that otherwise not so lucrative if msp enforced will not stop farmers try new crops and be in loop of ensured msp crops we were importers of wheat and paddy and now we growing them in excess probably high time give msp on pulses and oil seeds instead or similar crops which come under basic needs and imported
congratulations all kishan brothers and sisters and sriman rakesh tiket ji ko
2 bjp goons like deep sidhu and they many in no were allowed by police and supported by police in reaching red fort and defame farmers as well as sikh community
they might be farmers but belongs particular political party that also belongs caste
but why mandi system only good in punjab and haryana government should make more mandis accross country so that all farmers could get good price for their crops
ndtv showing only one side of story in lakhimpuri both parties were were responsible both parties killed each other but farmers played victim card
after all farmers deaths curses shall come upon this man god speed
since for several months farmers struggling like anything farm laws which against farmers should be cancelled immediately by present bjp ruling government which farm laws raised by present bjp government actually farmers not only protesting for their benefits but for benefits of entire nation

india has every right carry out farm reforms these farmers do not seem understand that free market system will help them become more productive and wealthier socialist system will not change their current status their children will inherit that sad existence under current system
congress in that condition that if bjp says rahul gandhi best candidate for pm they will start opposing rahul gandhi too
dear dhruv i follow your videos and really appreciate your work but regarding farm bills i think did not get your points right i think should delve deep into free market economy and why or why not good for farmers and consumers
if farmer protest fails this will be last protest we witnessing
truth on ground that people like this law and government after looking at acceptance level they not trying too hard resolve this issue reason behind that that these so called farmers only asking for repeal and once decision made and if good for nation then modi not going repeal no matter how much this escalates
3 bjp activists and 1 driver were beaten death by so called farmers
no body uttered word when families of bjp were killed in west bengal post election violence
anyway congress will loose punjab will win with flying colours
look at this man really good actor of india from gujrat that why people of india gave him pm position but oscar awards always goes other countries actors i so much affended by this yar this oscar awards showing so much partiality towords indian actors look at our honourable prime minister narendra modi ji such good natural actor

whatever happened on 26th was preplanned by bjp and rss goons guy who posted video of raising flag at laal kille deep sidhu has deep connections with bjp his pictures viral on social media where sitting with pm and amit shah in conference room sunny deol has regarded him as his younger brother if khalistani has anyone questioned pm modi and amit shah clarify their connections with khalistani people
why farmers r protesting this bill will benefit them
we stand with indian farmers

who saying punjab up elections coming
i am saheb das from west bengal son of farmer our family dependent on farming we got badge of unemployment long ago due wealth of present government last winter cultivated paddy could not be sold yet due low market price becoming difficult run family every day
they have prevented farmers from realising real price and income for their crops
my future pm yogi ji i will only vote for yogi ji jai hind
now last law says farmer can sell his crop anywhere in india how can farmer afford travel and sell his crop with all travelling expanes gas and so when there farmers who own less than 2 3 acres
forget about losing battle modi and shah have not even begun play their game and i saying this when i congress supporter i know what they can do
himanta biswa sarma conducting mass rallies for election in assam especially in btad area violating covid 19 rules there no law if bjp does rallies but for regional parties u can guess there so called covid 19
corporate will away lands of small farmers
and one more point commodity share market will not give msp minimum support price as markets behave on demand supply and future predictions may give indicative fair price but that can be lower than farmers own expense and hard work
standwithindianfarmers
as print going by laws farmers scared of outcomes of these laws because wherever contract farming has been put in place eg bihar farmers have been reduced labourers by corporates also what about handling greivanves of farmers in case of dispute highest authority they can go sdm not even courts what about that
government compares itself with and other advanced countries like see we can become like them if we privatise everything but they do not say they can give free education huge subsidies farmers each and every corner of country our government should first priotise education and farmers subsidy and prove their capability
gist of all farm bills concept of rich and poor state new for me
2 minimum support price concept dynamic one depends upon yearly produce and corps may vary from one year another cannot be fixed by law however in proposed ammendments govt saying that will not remove msp concept
thanks bbc make emotional but govt of today rational so its not going happen i am yet see any argument point by point against law just blind opposition that i do not like so back will not cut ice xi getting tough so its not going be easy for walk and from mr modi not gandhi who discards deserving and favors emotional blackmailers

sushil kajal hindu farmer not sikh of 1 5 acres land died shame on this dictatorial government killing its people
farmers protested as govt now refused buy non basmati paddy which purchased by only govt and when sold directly traders they give very low price as compared price which govt pays for non basmati paddy farmers would have occured heavy loss due law and only after protest did govt agree purchase that paddy
shes absolutely right in demanding legal orders as theyre stopping her for no reasons i support her for showing courage in situation u go priyanka gandhi
i watch lot of aim content there times i agree with him completely and times when i question him aim has always been critical of modi and wants him do better that fair enough but that does not mean always right modi seasoned politician and has learnt from manmohan and vajpayee they stuck on and lost government modi stood by demonetisation which affected far more people has his reasons for withdrawing farm bills we need show trust in pm we chose

any sudden change system after 60 years leaving completely market forces led by private players and thinking that automatically farmers would change cropping pattern as private players would only buy quantity they require and more so with grains already held with government for next two years would lead entire crop be left unsold why would private player buy at all unless can resell at profit later so prices would get depressed this exactly fear of farmers and rightly so

and monopoly will destroy by privatization basic economics and supply always controlled by farmers because they only producers and we cannot buy anything from any price or without having quality due msp farmers growing any kind of quality and sell government on good prices i think as produced their duty supply quality crop indonesian growing better quality rice than with knowledge of our farming techniques and export usa but usa reject our rice because of poor quality of farmers now days same educated like theh have internet connection access education from all over world

farm laws were already in abeyance and stayed by sc this decision only prevent further agitation and disturbances since has now been portrayed as govt vs sikhs confrontation i am sure laws will definitely come back in new avatar satisfying everyone already some states have facility of direct selling by farmers buyers and not going through middlemen
congratulations farmers

madam salute and your entire team for coverage farmers protest against black farm bill
bjp minister ajay mishra son killed 4 farmers
but farmers skeptical fearing that removal of state protections that they already consider insufficient would leave them at mercy of greedy corporations
but procurement by fci in open ended basis right why then that only few large farmers benefit from existing scheme of things
no one can say anything about this bill unless farmers because they know what good for tham n what not
so large farmers for sure will benefit from these amendments but small marginal and landless farmers might actually loose expensive but dependable source of credit which required even before crop cycle commences pm kissan meagerly enough for input procurement aid partly for consumptionand partly for input procurement varying from case case basis
we all should hope that taliban do not over pakistan because pakistan has nuclear weapons and those weapons in hands of taliban global trouble
india never do mistake sending indian force afganistan against taliban only thing india worried that our people in afghanistan must be in safe investments in afganustan should not be disturbed by taliban other wise india would not even think about taliban fight with them further india wants maintain good relationship with taliban like how india maintain with other nations if taliban gives problem india then india will react teach taliban immediately

tikait and others should be arrested and jailed for aajeewan karawas in murder of innocent kisans and other crimes
look once at non bjp ruled state they come in power by promising give employemnt and reduce price hike
horrific congress baki partia karwa bjp clear victory shame killing justify
those who r saying that this bill would open different ways for farmers just note that corporations controlled by businessmen they would buy crops at even lower price than msp and would sell them at much elevated prices consumers just make more profit and this situation cannot be prevented because corporates not transperant and no arrangements and measures made against these situations by government in these so called bills so in short this bill big fuck consumers and producers
parts of interviewers reactions were so insincere by both manisha and atul lousy interview only person who was sincere here was rakesh tikait
their unity can atleast see through couple of years of corporates entering farming sector in rest of country later they can decide if they do not want corporates they can still remain united and maybe protest then with real life bad examples of this bill instead of protesting in assumption in that case entire nation will understand and stand by protest instead of just 2 states
i support farmer
farmers very much justified in their protests
religious extremist parties cannot solve farmers justifiable needs
absolutely correct rakesh tikait ji kisan mazdoor eikta jindabad
simple opposition farmers brainwash aur farmers ko wellfare chayiye hi

every person living in this country first farmer and then religious businessman and job
sir now let do some numbers here total rice and wheat production in india around 123 tonnes and 110 tonnes respectively if government plans buy all at msp then total cost comes around 5 lakh cr our tax revenue 11 lakh cr and that has part of my income in sir i sir am tax payer unlike any of rich farmers who never paid any tax and no political party has guts even broach that topic i believe pay taxes too would kiss goodbye education healthcare defense sanitation and infrastructure funding buy wheat and rice at msp which artificially inflated price of these two commodities how about my sabziwala who goes street street selling his farm grown perishable items farmer too when was last time picked up fight with govt for his safety net for his share of msp so sir please do not tell that this was all inclusive protest where every farmer from every part of country was included and reason for that 88 of farmers in state of punjab and haryana sell their crop at msp for farmers in rest of country do your own digging sir and trust me youll be disappointed know numbers there
so poor farmers who do not have eat protesting really
absolutely correct and must pay compensation for deaths of so many farmers from his own assets and pm fund since prime instigator of these laws
why repeal leave states farmers in some states entrepreneurial like gujarat farmers had opportunity of contract farming raise investment and share risk of farming with large companies all that gone
very wrong decision not as if all farmers of india were protesting only in punjab and haryana
agar kissan pao kural marna chahta hein do uneducated logo aise hi this called natural selection agar kissan income zaada geya cost of living badh in fact hisab agar kissan new farm bill rasto aake andolon bill pass nehi
farmers most important people and major sectors i would say all sectors depending on them and if they in trouble then i would say government not working properly and all politicians begging votes before elections and then they not working for farmers
god bless all farmers
one of biggest problems u missed about corporates which ruin farmers
these 3 laws were opportunity for small farmer sell crops at higher prices
excellent video two points 1 contract farming could still be exploitive as farmer bears risk of reduced production and yet selling at lower than market price during surplus production quality clause loophole that could be exploited by buyers avoid buying all produce farmer makes 2 lack of legal validity of msp was supposed be counterbalanced by govt buyer food corporation of india which assured be outside cartals because not private entity concept of govt owned corporation break monopolies or cartels used in some countries eg france and anathema in others eg usa india belonged former group with companies like bsnl fci ai etc existing prevent monopoly and cartelization current govt seems ideologically inclined towards dismantling this model
thank for making this video i was eagerly waiting for this as punjabi i really feel bad about image that being shown on media channels about punjabi people or farmers idk how these news anchors like sudhir chowdary sleep at night i really hope that govt back these laws

yes there were only some farmers that were objecting these laws huge agriculture states were missing from these protests why some of new law provisions already there in most agro states so largely punjab that has fallen as number one agro state and political beings like takait and yogendra yadav were protestors true also that elections around corner in these states hence timing wise seems be reason but if this repeal going cost farmers of these states further go into downward spin then sadly onus will have be on them and also experts media and govt who really did not explain law properly these farmers
india was funding ttp tehreek taliban pakistan since india has left afghanistan not single attack on pakistani soil
aree yar abb kisan log phirl dark ages wapas lot jayenge farm laws were blessing for farmers and now gone

salute all ravish sir team for true reporting of farmer supports
farmers humanity
but entire nation stands together with farmers
mr tikait sir right saying pm of india cannot go for convassing political party pm pm of india and not pm of bjp
only 4 of indian farmers get msp and assured government procurement other 96 do not get that why up bihar farmers do labour in punjab and haryana now modi government wants farmers of punjab and haryana also become migrant workers
we can understand circumstances which makes withdraw these bills which would have bring better days for farmers inspite of taking good decision for future for we failed by no opposing those fake farmer
modijiko deshpremi banaaye uparvaale jivit ishavar prabhu yeshupitaa satgurudev
so mindset of rewarding better quality above msp this will set better and positive competition and better yield and quality when farmers know that will get above msp if his quality better this way farmer knows that atleast going get msp
indian media masala only for trp show only negativity i am with formers i see hundred of times this situation in kashmir where police beets innocent public
farmers who overly dependent on mandi system has become feared over some hypothetical situation which created by some people spread panic i belonging farmer family still having active farming of wheat cotton both falls under msp my father others around him sees more opportunities with new bill i would bet on my father who also engineer as well maintain our farms than any other
now come at protests india country of 1 4bn 60 of its population work in agriculture do really think some 5 10 thousands farmers from only 2 states represent whole nation these protests were organised due vested political interests people who sat on roads have nothing gain from repealing of these laws though if they real farmers then loss of opportunity for them
god bless farmers
very good punjab and haryana i love
usa stands with farmers of punjab
we stand with farmers usa stands with
amazing that u put such huge protest into three minute long clip and give political color seems only platform carry out protest twitter which guys applaud when dickheads trend bantwitter on twitter if u do not have balls stand with farmers due some vested interests then atleast do not oppose them either and bring entire protest bad light
first nail on modis cross i hope and wish that people of india unite and throw this narcissist out or power before destroys democracy
lovefarmersbrotherstill
very wrong decision shows that government weak and lacks willpower go through reforms 80 farmers who were supportive of these laws have nowhere go now shows how hooliganism has won its distressing nobody has won but nation has lost big opportunity
farm laws were biggest opportunity for farmers which they mistook and forced government back decision i still believe that they were good for farmers and government should make voluntary
passive bhakts happy that their plan has worked and started comment charging on farmers
i admire your efforts but there some factual errors central govt buys at msp from apmc traders they buy from farmers at much lower rates and sell govt on msp price ideally state govt agencies should buy from farmers at msp but they often absent from apmcs or do not make spot cash payment farmers but if quality of crop good and much in market demand apmc traders buy at higher rates e g mps sharbati lok1 wheat cg basmati paddy etc
why panjab and hariyana farmers protesting ans this states farmers enjoining 95 of msp
after election modi government will put in other similar laws
instead of govt criminals must pay compensation suffering farmers or criminals must be hand over their families
bjp goverment scared they know they going loose in this election
farmers turned violent after they promised would be peaceful
this bill will empower farmers i support
there minimum guaranteed price for farmer in this contract buyer liable pay that price even if there no yield secondly if prices rise after contract farmer can get thst price athe time and point of sales

hoping best for these farmers i hope government takes back law or does something about otherwise most probably indian farmers will leave profession then india may suffer food crisis
here new bill can increase hold of private sector on farming which may leads higher price of agriculture product in retail market and lower profit farmers
victory for democracy but huge loss for farmers if we decisions with good intentions one should not worry about outcomes
but out of my understanding why congress now saying modi govt corrupt
chitra tripathi rakesh tikait neta and might be thinking in her mind chutiya hoon
do only haryana and punjab bandh people protesting there not here
for sake of stability in punjab i e stop khalistani successionist activities this okay step but farmers of india have lost opportunity for innovative growth this failure of bjp there lack of transparency accountability and consensus making or lack of basic democratic values led this stupidity
they always had problem with sikhs its not that they have problem with ravi singh their problem that khalsa part of his organization who help people around world this zee channel did not have problems when they helped around world but as soon they step up help farmers in punjab they labeled them khalistani shame on zee news
this time we watching tractor parade not modi
misusing identity of farmers
many farmers had sacrificed themselves for farm bill but government did not even listen their needs
govt should decide msp on their own and make law that not mandi nor open market can buy below this if they will then would not beneficial for farmers
night madam absolutely crisp and clear this khalisthani move supported by anti nationals including defunk congress
sir should have done this episode in hindi and in local language so that farmers should have correctly understand these new farm laws
as cricket fan and understanding from your video and explanation benefit of doubt should go farmer in this case can government state central can make some standard and simple agreement drafts help farmers protect from special terms and conditions 50 and 100 limits much bigger control on later states why cannot these be below 20 25
shame on zee media

2 on calling that why people confused about routes when was already published in newspapers firstly was not small rally and most of people participating were traveling during those days so they were not able access newspapers secondly farmers not everyday travelers delhi so some of them do not know routes get back and got confused in between chaos created by wrong elements thirdly there was news given by locals that in some areas bjp supporters have planned throw petrol bombs on tractors so they diverted from actual routes
i am with farmers
really these acts made for welfare for farmers so why they protesting and why they not allowed enter delhi
2 second law farmer can sell any where any one with pan card
i support farmer but guys best neutral but i want tell u that those swords nihang singh part guru gobind singh provided them so that why they carry i hope understand before judging people have clear all points from all prospects and i see many videos where local punjabi reporter interviewing some modi bhaks who claims be local people but shakes hand with police when cameraman record that police man ran away thats showing some police man not all and some delhi local bad people came together and know 30 police man beating one sikh boy until his unconcious by hitting turban that inuf then any sikh comes defend himself godi media show that was terrorist please see local news do not see any other
20 of opposition of farm bills won against 80 of pro farm bills on basis of benefit of doubt agriculture reforms need of hour corporate seller and producing farmer nexus important without middle men who eat up benefits drawn out of corporate seller well if government took back bills in january itself things would have been lot better keeping in view of beginning of feb delta outbreak
most of indian media has totally forgotten about them
because of uttar pradesh election bjp done this after election they will be back adani and ambani
these lions of punjab my full support them going
but govt assured that apmc will always be there and msp will always be provided there apmc will never be shutdown its farmers choice go outside and explore more options or go apmc just like bsnl there along with other private telecom operators regulate telecom tariff my father farmer from karnataka very hardworking person we grow paddy here from 40 years what i am observing only middlemen and millers benefitting from our crops after working so hard and investing so much on labour and pesticides facing natural calamities labour problems water problems machinery problems new type diseases in crops and all what we earn just accommodate our basic needs of food cloths bike thats forget our hardwork sometimes we will not get back our investment also present crop cutting done in this dec month complete loss for all paddy growers here yield reduced very drastically due new virus in our crops just like covid on humans we not made any property from past 40 years we do not get any thought of making some property with that earnings just life goes on with hardworking forever so something be done benefit farmers all these days only businessmans middlemens having decent earnings and making properties everywhere small farmers fate remains same even after another 50years until unless if something done now our country developing means everyone of should develop everyone be part of only few sector people developing not whole development of country these farm bills not big news here in south india or at least in our locality big protests and all happening there in north india i doubt does farmers really able understand these farm bills properly mostly some opposition parties middlemens and others who benefitting now having knowledge understand these bills and its impacts and safeguard their earnings in future they provoking farmers with false predictions protest against those bills i trust our pm modi like our family head never do anything harmful farmers or any other sector hardworking people does not have intentions earn something by supporting corporates bcz not even have children earn for them treats all of as his children these farm bills actually beneficial farmers and consumers except those middlemens initially there may be some loopholes bcz everything cannot set right on one go will some time block all loopholes later definitely will have good future in farm sector also

good leader modi ji leader should be more flexibile
now godi media act like supporting farmer protest
what about farmers in rest of india who did not have problem with revised farm laws no farmers protested in maharashtra west bengal tamil nadu or in states where non bjp governments rule i agree that government should have extensively discussed laws in parliament took stakeholders interests into account before passing them i find curious that role played by opposition mislead farmers teach modi lesson not being discussed in this episode probably they now gloating over after modi rolled back laws but farmers will realise their folly in near future lose lose situation
v farmers what about 4 others
farmers cannot go delhi due corona but amit shah can go hyderabad hipocrisy
government in haryana wants farmer heads be broken
politics 101 diverting from answering questions raised by farmers and making all about opposition
one with protesting farmers of my country
first they not farmers because in democratic countrie can protest but this kind of
i am so impressed with selflessness and awareness of indian farmers there only one point that directly harming them other three seems be apparently in favor of indian farmers yet they anticipated harm of these in long term and how these laws will effect common person and decided fight against this level of selflessness can only be expected from farmer may they be victorious
abhay dubey right rss will trying support bjp in up election that why they jumped in kisan andolan again

msp provided only in mandi but will never be paid by businessman this what farmers asking for make msp legal thing its simple but this govt wont
msp valid point but price should depend on quality about apmc small farmers can t go apmc so will get befits also on famers they can sell where they want
indian has deployed 1 million army in kashmir stop voice of innocent kasmiri people now what will they do with their own farmer protesters who raise their voice against hinduta govt who involved in descrimination of minorities
i support this farmers
farmers not stupid
govt farmer leader who also wants msp in old video i have seen
i from india and this bjp government not good for indian democracy
punjab election coming that why took this decision great achievement of our farmers support dear farmers from tamilnadu vande mataram
farmers can punish this govt by not selling anything them starve this govt be bent on knees
if congress comes power real farmers will come streets until then india has bear this nuisance of paid rogues
government should tell farmers that if their income doesnt increase in timeframe therell be option go back older ways politics should not stop experiments specially if farmer suicides has been issue which dates back congress days karz dher and karza maafi not option farmers should be reassured and in confidence so that these politically motivated protesters get exposed
waiting fir tahrik e taliban over paxtan and impose sharia law paxtan supports afghan taliban but enemy of their own taliban they will soon realize value of freedom democracy education music entertainment etc
my family involves in farming and i know very well gundagardi of mandi system
those opposing farm bill should at least watch this video once anyway i support this farm bill
not true farmers do not need laws but support
what full video where jeep running over aged farmers from behind
one of best coverage of farmers protest i have ever seen great work samdish on
scoop whoop sentinels of righteous information and indignation if we do not defend farmers game over might as well hand over our republic saffron fascists on silver platter jai kisan and long live true free press of india veera vanakkam
respect for library on legs yes this best thing happened farmers in independent india
4 civil courts have been added in new ammendment as place settle disputes its just that takes lot of time disputes in courts but now farmer there also have option
i am with farmers but not with state government of punjab and some 400 500 artiyas who ruling roost this protest by for and of artiyas who fear they will lose 5k 7k crore annual income them and state by way of tax charged which 6 7 they trying create fear that corporates ambani adani will away their land and what not artiyas bicholiyas also private individuals and everybody knows how they deal with farmers fear of artiyas that farmers will be free from their chungal
according one of three laws of government they now allow corporates do contract farming sounds good theoretically but in reality many of farmers in this nation not much literate enough read and understand sesquipedalian contracts by these corporates and this will be harmful in long run assume that farmer sows potato but company says that this not their kind of seeds and they show contract farmer and file lawsuit and farmer life destroyed
i have never seen such bias reporter and channel in my life why do not rename zee news as bjp news
just suggestion new laundry when make jokes about modi or bhakts actually detach huge chunk of population out of conversation making them immediately close video there people who idolize him so if want engage and change their perception so that their voting behaviour becomes more rational gotta make your videos more inclusive jibes of bhakt will only make them even more polarized this message also goes each and everyone reading engage not confront after all irrespective of our ideologies we share one common thing that love for india jai hind
great modi ji super duper would leader jay hind jay bharat great modi ji
if poor farmer can afford 33 6 crores of rupees on one event how much has been spent on agitation
if real farmers have any problems comeout from tikait and talk any educated people and ask or discuss their worries upon bill
oppositions have no work now they will blame for happenings in year 2029 because modi ji will be pm
i think your comments negative on farm reforms despite facts admit farm long good and then make comments on merits irrespective of farmers accepting them or not
pm modi quite good at communication this matter really needs be solved by proper discriptive communication and must remove any misconception if farmers have any cause we know their opposite parties as well bcoz this protest not good for farmers as well
thanks for finally bringing out this issue which our indian media was trying hide and neglect
good for country as otherwise nation might have lose great leader mr modi as pm due possible bjp defeat in north
repealing farm laws was not prudent move
2 actual control of protest not with farmer leaders rather funding and control with khalistani left maoist anarchists who wants distruction of idea of india
this last nail in modi career we need yogi for 2024 modi grandpa not able handle political pressure
i stand with farmers
one of friend farmer from raichur karnataka used farm tomatoes and wen goes apmc they u used bid for starting from 10 rupees for 25 kilo max max could get 30 rupee for 25 kilo so stop
holistic organic farming key india food security but at same time plutocracies surrounding indian farmlands and contractual labour and entrapment done by apmc traders should also be looked into and also state govt have power bypass farm bills so protest do not make sense i think one should look at data that comes out from states that have implemented new act after some years and then make any judgement regarding same
huge respect my indian farmers from turkish farmers let me know guys if need any support from our government playing same game over here
congratulations farmers for their unity and integrity
kindly edit caption police clashing with peaceful farmers and not farmers with police

hi meghnad government does not buy remaining grains unsold at mandis govt does open ended procurement at msp that govt cannot refuse buy from any farmer that brings his grains fci problem small and marginal farmers do not have means carry their produce fci godowns n end up selling at monopolized cartel infested mandis no supporter of govt these bills have big flaws but apmc should go
4 what happened in bihar by abolition of apmc what chances of not getting replicated across india since we have overall surplus of grains as we ow for fact
i am from pakistan i personally feel that mr modhi spoiling fresh face of india
farmers had right protest but there certain norms which need be followed while protesting against any topic or issue
excellent detail eye opener due very nature of this complicated bill appreciate these bills definitely need every citizen support considering poor farmer of our country
do u know al economist and expert supported farm law
i appreciate tht bjp most intelligent party in world atleast they know they have not acknowledge properly so called farmers and now they will find other way possible help farmers i know coz modi did in gujrat and gujrat now most developed states in india
i really got very emotional on hearing this news we congratulate farmers for their patience and perservance on their year long protest no doubt this has come with very heavy price so many precious lives have been lost and so much of turmoil and bloodshed has been witnessed rubbing salt into their wounds farmers were labelled as traitors anti national khalistance forces and what not by bjp supporters modi can now forget get even single vote here after what worse in coming elections there going be tremendous anti modi wave and very bad back lash in all northern states with all his experience modi should have read writing on wall long back modi hands smell of blood and stain will remain forever jai hind

people who do not know f in farming and left their motherland for fulfilling their selfish motives protesting in expensive cars at foreign location as how indian govt should frame policies on its internal affairs wow
crazy now really sad see farmers protest being destroyed
there about 130 million farmers in india more than population of many big countries in world and certainly not all of them protesting because most of them will be benefited from this law
farmers united n every demand will be met because urge for power will bring down any person on knees
there should not be repealed of these farm laws there was needed of modification of farm laws because of this we and agricultural sector going back about decade we need certain regulations and laws for mordenize our agricultural sector
when kangana said terrorist farmer hurt me lost respect but eventually see be true
yes today really black day for real farmers of india we lost 4 generation warfare so sad
bjp raj saheb chit pat one day this desh will be land of king and wasir amit shah and modi no one will be more imporatant then them
we did not brought law overnight but we never consulted with farmers about law because was not necessary
90 of farmer in 21 states have no problem with new law only 10 who belong particular state and richest among farmers causing trouble government cannot back law completely that was meant help those 90 poor farmers because rich 10 think this will reduce their income little bit
and what steps can govt for helping farmers except these bills
one one had opposition claims agriculture state subject and on other they blame central govt for farmers death
does anyone care what opposition says they speak both sides people of india with modiji no more talks with these anti social elements who have made poor farmers sit on protests forcefully
did get all this wisdom after bills repealed or have made any video before suggesting your favorite leader what do
what about need of provision for cheap and speedy redressal for disputes arising if any out of contracts entered and other farmer corporation issues
best of luck rakesh tikat shaab
big agitation head from april 22 implement farm bills
questions there path for these middlemen wholesaler procure at 800 from farmers and sell government at msp calling themselves farmers making profit does government do checks on such spurious trades
2 does this end msp no msp will continue since govt has procure food grains for distribution 50 of urban population and 75 of rural population for 80 crore population farmers need understand dynamics of msp in food deficit years food self sufficiency was achieved by green revolution technologies and schemes inter alia grow more food intensive agricultural area programme offering minimum support price msp currently supply exceeds demand in msp crops including those without procurement leading market price fall
and was saying farmers of haryana were in support of farm laws liars
was like movie and when rakesh tikait cried was turning point i got goosebumps while listening this episode more powers farmers
congratulations all farmers
request all up belt show your support yogi ji and make him cm in 22 and pm in 24
bjp walo pass vedio proof nhi h blame daldo same congress
3 there need move away from paddy wheat sugarcane cycle punjab and haryana have played major role in india food security time that they given due respect and incentivized move towards more commercial crops where govt will not have bear losses india has surplus of rice and wheat worst we cannot export because procurement costs high
stop calling them farmers
india must establish good relation with taliban using their diplomatic skill protect indian interest in and around afghanistan
1 if procurement has be tinkered with there has be alternative for farmer cannot leave all farmers of pb hry out in cold
farmers feeling insecured
farmers agitation will not have any impact on modiji govt
msp generally greater than price in apmc and makes profit farmers
rakesh tikait was so savage loved
farmers power
none of these leaders concerned about farmers or national interest their interest about wining states like punjab and then make double u turn
victory farmers support indian farmers
thing that punjab and haryana farmers income will reduce while d increase for other states which i believe good thing as farmer really have very poor condition in states like bihar maharashtra etc
proud b farmer
this protest and reactions in india largely due ignorance farmers earn just fraction compared prices of goods due middle men farmers in cycle of loan and repayment and most of farmers only know their regional language in which middle men can easily manipulate news said farmers i think new laws more like antrust laws break monopoly of middle men and how monopoly well farmers can only sell their goods middlemen in their region or town otherwise they cant sell directly due regional or state laws
poor farmers still they targeted
as far as i checked only ndtv showed 1st part where those mf hits poor famers with cars all other godimedias who eats and poops money hide real news and showing after parts were farmers provocated do so hatsoff ndtv pls i do not need any excuse reply from anthbhakts humans always welcome for replay

now govt has given freedom farmers select customer of their choice
i knew this already when i first saw news i mean how tf ppl able easily enter redfort how come peaceful protest can turn into mob attacks there no way this not scripted defame farmers protest thanks for putting word out
ravish kumar ji aadab real son of india great human being and above all roll model of jurnalism in india god bless
thanks god local punjabi media was reporting live at that time clearly farmers has been peaceful during this time but police let bjp goons near protest and throwing stones police even started tear gas shells within farmers protest
in full support of agri bill govt organizations do not have expertise drive massive industry we have 6 middlemen between farmer and consumer at moment according stats if bigger more streamlined player can cut gap between farmer price and consumers cost while also providing storage capacity will improve farmer profit and stabilize prices too people hating on this bill need look at stats we have massive potential export we need private players do this not zero sum game
since this bill has came i have not watched any vedio as i was not able understand these bills but after this vedio i got know each and every aspect along with why our farmers protesting thank sir

why this much long more than 1 years this farmers protest running around capital delhi only by blocking every human life earning in surrounding area
i support farmers culprit should be arrested
farmers do have issue which demands attention of government but they need realize limits of their agitation lest should boomerang
um i still do not get though i understand their frustration but keeping status quo and not reforming farming sector not answer there new technologies and internet based food industries being built in india that can benefit everyone especially farmers instead of repelling laws entirely which does not seem viable farmers should come negotiating table as they clearly need safety framework in place but they not doing that instead its just choke hold of protests that stifiles any meaningful evolution of old laws that still plague india

3 in video already mentioned that cartelization and teaming up happens in apmc markets today so what sense in continuing with same system and support more middle men who do not let farmers get worth of their hard work toil
1991 we opened markets for other 2 sectors leaving away farming so other sectors developed and our farmers suffering
india different at least from here we see they treat farmers almost like trouble makers and untouchables indian government treat indian farmers as burden of country government especially as india claimed democracy should be for people majority of people in india farmers government should work for them serve for them but indian bjp government does not care about them at all
i have watched and heard this discussion on other platforms by non political entities argument and points brought by those experts completely gone missing in this videos i am aware that only so much can be covered in 20 mins time will tell of this favourable bill or anti farmer bill but one thing still begs question why this bill was passed in such hurry there no smoke without fire

i am from kashmir and i happy for farmers atleast they win in our kashmir brutality such that we protest for dead bodies return for burial katil modi
second even if we assume that if bill was decided by actual votes bil would not have passed then what have happened then in this case where bill passed by lok sabha and rejected by rajya sabha then joint sitting would have been happened where member of lok and rajya sabha have voted collectively together then for passing of bill only 393 vote required even in worst case senario bjp has more than 400 seats in both rajya and lok sabha but this was done by voice vote in covid because would have been easier and fast by voice vote

modi never realised that we voted him decisive and firm decisions instead preached high but delivered substandard in some artificial fear of rejection
calling them farmers will be insult real farmers working in fields
big zero for hypocrite tikait should be projected as pm candidate in favour of opposition then all opposition will go against tikait

well done by farmers they know laws better than any one relating thier field
but should be passed in economical way in right of farmers not in government way
godi media shame on from pakistan
whole world with farmers
3 bills 3 simple points 1 govt should write in bill itself that msp will not be removed farmers want written assurances 2 eca bill no problem farmers but will affect all consumers in india unless dont eat food govt has removed hoarding limit on essential commodities so private corporations can store as much of food grains and essentials commodities as much they want in this way they can make artificial shortage in market and prices will go high and inflation go up and will effect all consumers and their more point in that govt cant intervene unless reach double so this govt helping middleman not removing 3 3 corporate farming in this there provision that if any private corporation doesnt pay farmer in 15 days can only complaint sdm cant go upper judiciary
states had different rules and regulations buy food grains from farmers was difficult for corporates handle so many states with so many different regulations and taxes
however so shameful that everyone tried talk statuesque govt yet took year and loss of 600 farmers for our govt back laws
biggest mistake was messing with punjabi sikhs and their future livilhood and rights land they have been reminded of 1980s state oppression injustice and genocide thats still unresolved add insult injury they attacked sikhism integrity of indian sikhs and declared all farmer protestors as khalistanis and terrorists when rights enshrined in indian constitution denied and hindered then india has become dictatorial authoriterian state which mostly has been since 1950s especially against brave sikhs hence now karma will its course and things will need change bring justice genocided oppressed powerless and voiceless
modi politician at end of day thought of doing something in his capacity for farmers and vast majority were happy with but if vocal minority of rich powerful vested interest group with strong pr denting his image worldwide why would care about farmers but when silent majority actually realize what they lost will be too late they missed golden opportunity if they so naive comprehend who their friend and who their foe they better off being left their fate modi will find way win election but farmers will never find solution for their problems
thank u sir for clearing all my doubts about this bill now i support this bill 100 percent
even in this digital age so that biryani analogy wrong and does farmer has economic ability build and store in tonnes in cold storages like ambanis

big win for small farmers
who can trust america able handle china pakistan russia north korea iran etc even if fails against taliban
its disheartening see well intentioned folks fall propaganda of bjp on farm laws
armed forces of afghanistan will need show some spine and also act wisely not time go on offensive and spread itself thin which will in fact favor taliban but rather make strategic retreat fall back and regroup defend important cities exhort warlords and their militias join in fightback while conscripting able bodied men and women fight against talibani onslaught
so big corporate hoarders will create artificial gluts buy cheaply from farmers and then create artificial scarcity sell dearly end consumers so basically lose lose situation for both farmers and consumers and win win situation for private firms
please support for farmers
modi ji were also calling kishan khalistani terrorist anti national even killed farmer can not believe this govt
when they have been repealed congress saying something else
farmers should not forget that they were called khalistani and terrorist
congratulations modi for up elections
when bill comes there so much view points and discussion and propaganda but during repeal they did not even give points for taking back which hold for 1year 3month and cause so much tragedy quarrel several policeman and farmers died and no sympathy those people and still saying like prime minister showing mercy for taking back spit on such cowardness when passing bill speak all three bills himself but when taking back pass out his message his minister for not have courage enough show his face shameful for our prime minister

modi sha played every dirty trick in book dismantle farmers protests but they failed realise that they fighting farmers not politicians kudos farmers they have shown way forward
farmers usurped by rich super rich farmers nri owners of
if all farmers around country or even world demand extra money in lieu prevent stubble burning what will happen environment
apmc can eat rs 91 per kg and getaway big corporates cannot they would need show on their balance sheet roce return of capital employed of over 1100 will lead heavy scrutiny even if big corporates make huge profits say 30 50 roce they could give farmers much more in return than what farmers get in current apmc model
whether its farmers industrial workers or bjp or congress or anybody this nonsense not acceptable

i was waiting for your report thank so much for covering kisan andolan so well i am so happy that farmers have partially won battle now we want new law be formed ensure msp farmers of entire india
hi mam i have been following your channel from last 18 months though have tried your level best explain in plain language but this topic requires more technical approach what u missed here farmers adamant on msp as law and they want repeal why action all starting from punjab haryana and western up but protest from punjab more should have started from green revolution and rank of punjab those days when comes per capita income and agriculture growth rate and next should have focused why msp was so much seen as god gifts for punjab farmers and what flip side seen too much pesticides usage ground water depletion rise of cancer in punjab doab region and highest in india why only wheat and rice during upa time there was plan push for alternative crops minimise impact on water table etc and was not pushed up aggressively punjab has free electricity and water for farmers and subsidies has actually made famers pump more waters and msp at same time for rice and wheat now coming msp why no govt can legalise during upa time bill on food security was passed and maintain buffer stock current govt maintains 2 5 times of requirement in wto bali summit india signed peace clause and clause says developed country can provide max 5 subsidies and developing max 10 subsidies on output for this reason canadian govt has complained wto on our msp as artificial infringement on pricing same way china japan uk etx and max was canada on complain side if subsidies more and storage 2 5 times we have import less and as per wto agreement we have comply by various act clauses now if we making msp as law govt will be bound procure all 23 items as listed in msp and net procurement cost will be more than our estimated budget so we will not have any fund left for other sectors another demerits here we will be not able compet in international market because of high procurement price either way we have sell in loss and govt will have bear new law has actually benefitted rice farmers of assam dibrugath rice farmers of telegana and karnataka cardamom farmers of kerala cotton farmers of punjab etx protest mostly confined punjab haryana and western up rest of india marginal we need focus on historical data and current data for effective presentation so that will be beneficial everyone moreover per capita income of punjab stands now at 13 and agriculture growth rate behind haryana and himachal pradesh so all these needs be highlighted pls try next time by incorporating all if require any inputs can connect me i can be helpful any time best of luck

govt unable explain how will be objective of bills be achieved unorganized system will definitely lead more exploitation as mentioned that apmc were created stop exploitation best example before how unorganized system was exploiting farmers previously though apmc system exploiting farmers but there certain system which need effective improvements middlemens can not be removed even by new bills govt will have involve completely in purchasing produce remove middlemens govt will have be linking source between agriculturists and consumer govt will get power regulate living standard of agriculturists as govt regulate employees and politicians by way of salary increase each year govt unable satisfy farmers with question how will be objective achieved unplanned bills farmers reforms can not based on imaginary perceptions

all maharashtra with kisan bt other media do not showing this
i think there some problems in these bills which government trying resolve by talking farmer unions but anyone who says scrap all these bills absolutely wrong fun fact when congress introduced these bills bku bhartiya kisan union that green flags see in protest supported these bill and bjp mp sushma sawraj opposed so my advice go read these laws yourself for better understanding dont follow anything or anyone blindly both government and protest
logic simple middle men eliminated and farmers get their reliable price for their harvest and people not burdened with heavy price of essential commodities
report put more emphasis on journalists instead of farmers reports trained do so shame on media they dont say anything about police army all getting paid do soooooo
we support kisan andolan
why should government fight for poor farmers when poor farmers not willing fight on road for themselves
actually seems one state punjab and few illitarate fierce punjabis ruling india now
farmers and there next generation will always remember thanks lallantop for this documentary
so as i understand blame for introduction on modi blame for repeal on modi how convenient
i know sitting peacefully in cities and discussing farmers issues may not sound right but not right disrespect flag like this i just got remember colonial days of flagging down indian flag shameful act flag represents people of country not govt or their acts
havent witnessed fight for independence but have lived through big historical farmers protest through honest journalism
u r showing them like they r doing something revolutionary they r those farmer who hv 70 and they r just 2 of former or even less

punjab has one of most fertile lands in entire world not only ambani or adani but european big agribusiness companies basf yara bayer that why world largest protest do not get much of international media coverage

sir have been doing and done tremendous job kudos indian agrarian economy needs much more agricultural research directed towards increasing productivity of land and results analyzed on regular basis increasing wealth in hands of farmers will help improve economy also
do not underestimate power of normal kishan they backbone of our country treat them as freedom fighters our kishans playing major role like soldiers because they feeding all indian how soldiers gain strength defend our country without food salute kishans
one who eat food will definitely support farmer
run over anti farmer fellows
this bill has many negative externalities and does not serve public good or interest of public infact encourages monopolization of perfectly competitive markets which naturally leads inefficiencies and discourages innovation thats why in most countries monopolies illegal not sure why india stepping away from free markets monopolized system
i support indian farmers
let farmers
i am proud of farmer
these laws will be good for agriculture but bad for farmers 95 of small land holders will have exit farming and join ranks of daily wage earners on other hand agriculture and traditional farming as we know today will die natural death new order will replace existing one
if was people government would have withdrawn farmers act without delay
reason simple national media not covering protests in maharashtra kerala and up in up police even arresting farmers and even stopped electricity supply in one of protests perfect example of godi media bias and yogi gunda raj
what abhijit iyer says crap modiji more sharp
bbc takes any opportunity bash indian government anything appease their woke friends fact india needs modernize its farming practices
lucidly explicated by far this best video i have watched on farm bill 2020 thank
india with congress
i am indian from west up and there injustice being done farmers which wrong i strongly condemn this and government should change and accept farmers words modi government doing good for big businessmen but by implementing this law they will cut off stomach of poor farmers and laborers
all of know how efficient indian judiciary farmers will not only end up in court but they might wnd up in jail just because they cannot read contract properly big companies will have big law firms support them but farmers cannot afford fight them
god bless our farmers
thank for telling their stories fighting farmers from india
please continue stir my dear punjabi brothers i would like contribute towards my punjabi farmers please provide me details as where i can send some money

for innovation no farmers will produce less costly vegetables or those vegetables which seldom bought in effect some vegetables will be stopped cultivating by farmers and will be obsolete sir your comments expected
sack minister and save face modi ji
we should stand by farmers
yee log kissan name per galat i think indian govt action for that they not farmer thy opposition for indian govt
ajitji have done real job in farmers protests
ndtv more than happy than farmers
i agree that private participation in agriculture need of hour as will bring infrastructure and technology but farmers fears also true bcoz in india 85 farmers own 2 or less than hectares they do not have power bargain proper mechanism safeguard interests of farmers must be set up by bringing specific legislation elders farmers can be illiterate but young and educated farmers have been spearheading this protests so u cannot dismiss their concerns by saying they illiterate and unaware no they educated and know how defend their rights
excellent leader who firm in favor of farmers unity
contract farming option farmers can opt this option if they not happy then they can sell their product in thier local mandi as they doing till now then what wrong in this bill bill just giving new option of contarct farming and also govt will buy product on msp as they doing till now
farmers do have their own interests and we want them have and demand for that
kisans have defeated modi and bjp jai kisan
love and full support from pakistan
why farmers from only punjab and haryana protesting not from other regions
all indians with farmers hopefully
just so that western people know what going on since inception of independent india india has had one of highest suicidal rate amongst farmers over unpaid debt underpaid crop or simply failed produce indian agricultural infrastructure very different compared west and most farmers very small land owners barely making ends meet government provides service known as minimum support price sell their crops in government owned markets however this system has been den of corruption and being farmer really very difficult in india however new bill wants bring in corporate sector in field and create system of contractual farming which actually noon for farmers
so drones up see if mischievous activities taking place in farmers protest why not send these drones over parliment and gujrat see any mischievious activities taking place there
modi should pay tribute shaheed farmers and apologize instead of still trying prove that was rite
waah reason gave awesome because we were unable make some farmers understand farm laws properly we back though was good wtf this every person has some problem with some law make india law free
huge respect for brother thanks for covering farmers protest
sir i think no problem far farmers but government desired fix rate then problem solved
government unable stock more on same goods year on year and in rain might have seen government stock wasted farmers just grow same crop on msp guarantee and government have buy and stock or pile them consumption less and stock more wasted hungry stays hungry and government cannot feed all free cannot sold outside country for loss so they got new bill so wastage will be avoided directly sold in market will help government and farmers also think not grow same crop so rates will be slashed if quantity more government did good work but farmers have think smart and grow new goods which not available and if there loss in this government should guarantee no loss
as agri graduate i know benefits this act could make well explained neutral perspective farmer could get better market margin why should farmer not earn any profit while everyone else wants profit
farmers power
my brother and sisters of up i am from i am requesting do not vote jumla bjp against poor and middle class people and against providing government jobs indian youth bjp against government jobs
modiji every time lie now we do not trust this lier has said truth
punjab and haryana have very good market system for farmers thats why farmers have better income compare rest of country indian farmers allowed sell their produce anywhere in india from many years owner of 5 acres in bihar works as labourer in punjab why cuz open market system exploits poor farmers in bihar and other parts of country second law allows unlimited stocking privilege big corporations so they can control price so farmers also fighting for middle and poor class of society contract farming already failed in punjab
there no permanent friend or permanent enemy in diplomacy only permanent interest india should start accepting talibans and work in hand with them
now afghan government wished didnt its citizens for granted its shame because afghan government could of won this war against taliban but will loose because most afghan people dont trust their government help its people out i pray for afghan people hope for future
there many more farmers in india then these protesters who support law
discipline farmers good people
700 farmers died and this channel still supporting prime minister
after implementation this bill farmers leader could have initiated or state give also can initiate or panchayat also can be but no one coming and talking in rirection as far as farmer strike concerned
if farm laws so good why do farmers agitating
same thing applicable in indian media also
union minister son was driving farmers have identified him
farmers life blood of nation we all support your demands go ahed for right cause
heart warming at same time heart breaking see our farmers standing united against apartheid govt which nothing but puppet of international mega mafia families i am sorry but no use protesting on road smarter know their strategy think like them they do not give two hoots for farmers or people of this nation would be more smarter if farmers change tactice and organize against seemingly invincible as well as invisible enemy and do unthinkable build your own market think out of box unite organize build your own empire apmc can this time stop being exploiter and help farmers come up with effective alternative instead of just wasting time and resources on futile protest help farmers kill those desi mulimillionares local goons like ambaani adaani etc and muliinational megalomaniac monsters who will never rest until they buy all of land of india and yes they plan ahead of 100 of years and they have resources and patience wait out we hardly have any chance against them give them same thing back patience determination and well thought out plan come up with sustainable strategy
england broken by eu by brexit will its colony be dissolved by farmers atleast now with bhupinder grandson as cm and queen owned delhi pm question

police should have used big force on these farmers who looking have subsidies and damaging public properties without force they not able listen and follow rules without education this results fighting and disobeying police unacceptable
sir as u provided solution that msp should be legal means they get minimum price outside and inside mandis production of crops much large than requirement so not even in mandis they providing msp this solution will just increase problem of farmers as not equal msp atleast they getting something if should be legal then they will not be able get that amount because its not possible that whole production purchased so atleast something better than nothing even in this video u stated that in mandis also only 6 farmers getting msp what about rest which majority so atleast they getting something if this legalised they wont be able get that if they go against law thn everyone of knw outcome i also belong punjab n i genuinely want that farmers should get whatever right for them
people wearing these masks can never be farmers why indian government not taking appropriate action against them
most comprehensive yet concise presentation of farmers protest thank

bjp was expecting some home grown terrorism or renewed khalistani movement supported by pakistan and china and that real reason behind this activity india already fighting two wars pakistan and china domestc wars against kashmiri jihadis and mao folks in addition this punjab turmoil would be extra burden on bjp govt
3 bjp supporters and driver who has been killed by these hooligans compensation of 5crores each their family members should be provided by these so called hooligan leaders

my say farmers that speaking our radio only because our pm interact through prescripted dialogues social media videos and mann baath

such terrorist minds shud be banned from india
u talking about public property being destroyed but do not talk about how protesting farmers actually caught locals who were purposely going around smashing windows of cars and buses make seem as if protesters were causing damage these locals were probably also paid government goons like others that have been caught and confessed being before and for tractors that were pushing barricades aside well why were barricades there in first place not india democracy every individual has right protest u cannot justify violation of human rights by saying was not agreed upon route tho fact that there people who even disagree with these protests reason why india become fucking laughing stock for rest of world
2 kishan bill apas or drama of modiji for ensuing up election apas bill pass

2 if farmers want services of middlemen who have lost their jobs under new system they can just hire them directly and pay whatever percent they want farmers in fact better off because they free hire whoever they want and cultivate any relationships if they want do that
when modi was learning ride bicycle india had already started manufacturing aeroplanes and helicopters
now bjp would blame all other parties for their petty politics within in and outside parliament bjp could again begging back these legislations after detailed discussion and putting forth positive aspects of these laws and after proper media discussions and taking message farmers and rest of people
please make detailed video on present farmer scenario luved this video
hello kangna u there can only tweet against cong or any other party apart from her boss bjp party

modi degraded pm postion of india
seven hundred kishano hatayare h bjp rss and jjp h
indian media we should ignore all these and focus on sharukh son
in present senerio when 76 percent of farmers want leave farming and major of indian farmers near poverty line and non of previous govt system able uplift them then we should give this bill chance for at least some years may be this bill have some loopholes but there could be many thing in positive so yes we should not make political and should think of farmers only
i think farmers bill overall good but government should talk farmers and assure farmers on msp
mr ajit had great contributions for farmers coverage we proud of him has shown his true dedication when other media house did not stand for mr ajit had done one of best coverage already have stoped godi media tv subscription hope day we find and make his independent tv channel
sir can also explain why think farm laws will do good farmers will they raise their income that too quickly enough will they ensure that prices of essential commodities dont increase due supply shortage arising from hoarding farm laws good but not necessarily for farmers they good for others parties involved such as corporates or big sellers and government when every party involved looking for their interests why shouldnt farmers
i think 12 15 was election manifesto of bjp govt as news was of 2018 punjab elections been 5 years since
they not farmers becoz we all know conditions of farmer in india even they havnt their own tractor or other equipments of farming everything afford on lease and indian farmer cant spent as much money on such baseless protests and rallies by tractors such long time protests and rallies very money consuming and expensive should be thoroughly investigated from where they got funds for such anti social acts
jhuthe log farmers duing great job
why farmers only from punjab haryana western part of up

good job bro foodie supporting from delhi love u from not only from farmers but from ur fans too why other pages sleeping not supporting god bless u
edit massive respect our farmers they have shown as what real meaning of desh bhakt and democracy
i come from india where supposedly educated ppl celebrate repeal of laws that would have liberalized farming economy enabled farmers sell anywhere reduced food prices
possible for farmers accept modified terms of farm laws and monitor consequences of new farm laws for couple of years if these not beneficial whether govt prepared scrap them after two years term
i do not care for your opinion on farm laws but way u explained failure of modi govt
officials such as apmc agent middle man etc make difficult for small farmers get benefit
irony all most everyone happy with farm laws except farmers themselves people sitting in acs deciding what good for those who work in fields while cold winter night
farmers lives matter 159 indian farmers who died in protest against anti farmers bill paid silent tribute
finally not leaving farmers with his feku words what about his brain child demonitization drama let him explain
happy that pm modi understood protester 3 farm laws withdrown
punjab and haryana least productive state and they use both alarming amount of water
why till now not single farmer leader or anyone from their family members died yet in any farms incident only poor farmers died its quit shocking
will caption responsibility for more than thousand farmers lost their lives during protest against modi farmers law
bill for farmers or farmers for bill
respect our farmers waheguru mehar
modi doing bad by selling his farmers big companies privatisation of crops not good policy until governments assist their farmers financially his god might not forgive him i request my countrys government stop helping india until they cancel black bill
wht abt those farmers who died while protesting
why farmers not accepting farms acts with changes
do not mess with farmers they critical and essential economy
violent terrorist farmers hacked death 4 innocent bjp workers they creating issues by blocking roads as if country belongs their fathers forget enough of giving largesse these ungrateful farmers especially from punjab
bjp in big trouble now modi made mistake of underestimating indian farmers
great salute farmers who showed way how fight this nautanki govt
why government not set mrp price with raw goods as there mrp in finished goods i think if no one can buy less than mrp then farmers will not suffer that much
at 11 mins i was in so much agony typing with tears so much corruption exactly why so many farmers kill themselves
disappointed if only had read laws trying give freedom farmers by making laws more liberal just read them
till date punjab government does not implement new farmers bill in punjab because of congress government in punjab state now my point of view why farmers protesting whenever our home minister says we ready discuss on december 4 so punjab cm should response how situation will be normal but no no because of propaganda of congress and muslim community against center government
some muslim leaders in india support taliban
plz do not fight wid farmers
farmers will win modi hatred will loose
2 why we taking all farmers as poor or very poor people farming profession like any other profession so like any other profession some rich and some poor
godi media had all plans crush this farmer revolution
will these farmers vote for now bjp modi ask them
farmer do not believe his repeal word because may say later was joke like 15lakhs rupees in your account that why farmer want be done in parliament by paper work
previously i think modi not good person now i can surely says great prime minister india ever had all khalistani people know truth now they begin fear ha ha ha great
thank cover protest of farmer now many vloger need cover this protest in many ways
farmers best
thank for covering farmer protest matters lot thank
this makes bihar self reliant and farmers happy

we stand for our farmers
also word of thanks team nl for their consistent and committed coverage of struggles of farmers thanks again
just like they said farmers were given 100 rupees protest same way they said kashmiris were given 500 rupees protest

thank for covering this raised his sword protect d farmers from bjp gundas who had police protection also shame delhi police haryana police up police for brutality against farmers they have right defend themselves
bjp captian will split votes of sad and congress
honble courts and cbi may kindly also be watching on corporaters and their supporting politician so that they may not run away from country like frauder neerav modi etc after selling nationalized public sectors properties profits based 2 3 gujarati private corporaters
2 did any system from now onward created for poor farmer sell at his or her field or farm boundary without spending any transportation cost or labour cost
stop saying them farmers
as name suggests billseeks providefor nationalframeworkon farming agreements thatprotects and empowersfarmers engage with various businesses at amutually agreedremunerative price
ban bjp from contesting in indian elections
why government does not withdraw act in favour of farmers stop selective journalism
i still doubt govt will fulfill their demands they have only one step back and will see them back with all might and vengeance great see farmers grit and determination and your commitment honest journalism they ousted from their channel and now have become household name and brand all best sir worthy of their praises
since when did free market become bad thing farmers in india shy away from growing organic produce and choose grow standard gmo crops because of msp since they know quality of no relevance any quality supported by government promised minimum support price free market leads competition amongst producers better investments in products which relevant market demand example of avocado across world sustainable profitability for producer and also better quality product at better price for consumer product like rice cannot be monopolized by large corporate because if that true then amul has already monopolized milk industry in india milk producers getting fair value for their product yes because if amul will not pay local producers fair price someone else will or milk producers will sell directly customer which they do even now farmer protests based on fear mongering and unfortunately small percentage of educated class also standing in their support out of confirmation bias just because gives them opportunity reaffirm their hate towards political ideology
no farmers no food
may also happen many farmers on account of diverse produce as farm produce generally subject nature vageries
for anyone wondering what happened protest despite of many problems and hardships protest continued and finally government withdrew all 3 farms laws farmers won
kejriwal govt creating panic situation between farmers and bjp
man these farmers could have gotten so much more support if they had hoisted our tri colour flag instead of using flag of religious community by this we can understand that people involved here had no motive of helping farmers there sole motive was create conflict and distrubt internal peace within country
now accepted them as farmers his regret not enough for deaths from demonetization farmers laws covid 2nd wave so on still want thank modi ji no
farmers protest
wen u eat then think abt that food which grown by dese farmers
i hocked that joker leader of our farmers
i did not know indian farmers has particular religion i was with this protest untill this very moment now just bunch of moron with khalistani propaganda do not think bhagat singh died for this we really failed them jai hind
farmers deserve make living dont let rich everything like they have in america big business put little farmers out of their land bought them up
i think this act was good for indian real farmar
when bjp riling they have done anything wrong correct let be women children farmers but when non bjp do its wrong
why does paddy price in bihar 8 9 per kg and in punjab haryana 22 29 per kg in mind apmc system was demolished in bihar during 2006 07
no farmer no food up up farmer
thanks so much for supporting farmers
see farmers smart enough understand fact that by only non violent means they can win this war govt knows something must be done malign whole movement
did not use word msp in whole video here then why showing false statements on left side of screen moreover msp not mentioned in farm bills too
anyone tell me what good this bjp did for india other than making people sleep in streets
hence govt must ensure that private sector as well as apmc cannot purchase corp from farmers below msp made healthy auction set base price for corp that msp then who have power they will buy from farmers will create open competitive market for buyers and also fair mechanism for poor farmers
was actually nothing just anger of farmers used with wrong intentions by other political parties
whenever modi or bjp did not came in political reform will india not be progress
dear farmer brothers from haryana and punjab we keralites with u u feed this nation being consumer state we eating food becoz people there please bjp away next time jai javan jai kisan
this proves that win elections bjp can go any extent their days numbered now please in up elections do not want this buckwas janta party save india jai hind jai bharat
protest against government but do not insult india by waving your flag at red fort
modi government anti farmers because before this policy farmers get prize of maize 1600 per quintal but now due this policy farmers getting prize maize 500 rs per quintal now think farmers gave 400 rs labour and fuel consumption 500 rs now calculate numbers farmers expenses 900 rs but they getting 500 i very unlucky because i born in india where future of farmers zero hope i born in other countries where future of farmers bright jai kisan
i support farmers people now believing that farmers being paid by higher parties of india and canada one question for those people who believe this if this so then why did not our pm narendra modi care go talk them and hear what they wanted why was not press conference held in situation like this because our pm utter failure and will not be able face any of question of media
do not forget that everything started after bjp passed farm bills unconstitutionally in parliament
what hell keeping other states farmers in stake for just punjab
in kisanon congress acchi dharne per baithe aur indira gandhi ne goli chalva khush thy
farmers who defeat our slave mind pm
these definitely not farmers i think enough enough in india democracy being raped and for granted everyday we need hitler rule for few years knock these anti social elements
real problem there many farmers in india for be sustainable average farmer in india works insanely small amount of land be cost efficient
and all either farmer brothers or their sons
thank for sharing true information about farmer protest internationally
also paddy and such crops abundant in godowns now in our place we get rains twice year so we can grow rice punjab haryana depends on dam and canal water i think they should diversify their crops many in between crops can be grown also pisiculture horticulture also worth exploring in marathwada which dry region farmers grow sugar cane which highly water consuming
more strength farmers who feed 3
everyone talking about nishan sahib but no one talking about that they also hoisted farmers flag and they both hoisted below tricolour flag which also being carried by protesters in large numbers and also flag belongs sikh gurus and rulers who protected india for several decades
farmers backbone of india protect them
only yogi ji in uttar pradesh
important note for anyone who may not know bill targets all farmers across india not just those from punjab there farmers from other states who currently protesting and farmers from other states who have protested in past about farming conditions in general
farmers should be educated
this not farmer protest anymore khalistani movement backed by pakistan now state machinery should be applied with full force
consumers who were going hit severely by farm laws along with farmers failed understand consequences of laws consumers were required support farmers who remained as silent watchers we need help farmers in all respect in future so that even such laws should not effect
well played modi ji
this government spineless if i was in place of stupid modi then i would had called this tikait on one on one debate on national television and would had exposed him completely with facts
sad day for small farmers
i have heard rakesh tikait many times was always very witty but in this talk has come out with lot of depth
i think youth should watch and learn majority of farmers were our elders youth off today would not have had dedication and fight in them they all worried about going canada and driving trucks
this initiative should have been communicated farmers long time ago that these reforms were coming in their own vernacular
4 regularize msp even outside apmc market i e free market which introduced as per this new agriculture bill
hats off all farmers
tikait fool who agent of political parties does not even knw word of what written in so called anti farmer laws
its so hard reform anything in india i do not think repelling law best for farmers they should have given state option opt in for farm laws farmers already suffering with mandis parallel bargaining power could have been good for farmers but they failed understand that
finally done good hear that govt taking back farm laws and necessary pass bill for msp making legal but burning stubble should be illegal and no msp for farmer burning crops and please no subsidy for electricity and urea also govt should reduce taxes on diesel and petrol
some negative dimensions of creating difficulties in short term but reality that these provisions can improved our farmers in long term
i shall not vote kezriwal in punjab because himself had splitted punjab by removing sardar khera as opposition leader and ignoring mlas like kanwar sandhu dr gandhi etc by way as dictator does and bhagwant had not also tried unity of punjab for his own one man political interest
isko hi politics khte h vrna kisan 2 mhine peacefully protest kr or peacefully tractor march violation lge sb politician ne h
sikhs should start quitting army then see how modi reacts when india becomes weak
bjp election
if those punjabi who dream of separate nation of khalistan can leave india and settle in canada and make separate state out there no one will get kashmir nor khalistan indian armed forces will crush your evil designs against our nation
we stand with our farmer
indian agricultural sector has got massive setback now some of points needed be discussed now we need strong check on ngos and social media companies
why does not indian govt give farmers what they want if farmers feel insecure and threatened then govt should listen farmers
withdrawing now means could have also be done earlier and if this act for forthcoming election than they should be held responsible for farmers who have lost their lives damage has already been done hugely what makes people more angry announced just before election
its very sus see only punjabi in this protest as they wealthiest farmers and mandi lords in india
good account of events of day in relation farm bills unusually though coming from gupta uncle who has been quite harsh on modi as general rule state tax as bone of contention quite devastation now that likely not come with monopsony of fci and apmc will now stop
mr modiji shd guidelines of mr devendra sharma n help farmers who pillars
covid for farmers only but no covid for bjp meetings in hyderabad ghmc election ralleys roadshows meetings up cm amith shaw modi meetings there no covid

farmers
i south indian i like newest bill because we farmer can trade any place in india without any permission thanks modi government
and there were peace talks with farmer leaders about changes but they struck on their demand of repealing 3 laws and did not want any changes in end came down politics and bjp accepted farmers demand and repealed laws
farmers in delhi lions of india do not back down stand ur ground
2 all electric tractor rotavator harvester thresher like farm equipments
i guss our genius fm lady may reply like onions we not eating any agricultural products we eat poops so farmers protest will not affect

shekhar gupta stealth godi media hmv his master voice

farmers msp cannot by guaranteed guaranteeing msp means money goes from taxpayers or corporates pockets without any quality evaluation msp range per year can be proposed based on estimated demand by govt govt and corporate can use data analytics and set msp range based on historical and projected demands and make process transparent and visible but kisan cannot go court when msp not within range and no guarantee nobody knows accurate regional demand in advance
thats not true fact because these some agents of modi government by which they can blame on farmer protest
i with farmers
india must get freedom from bjp rss
while accepting fact that bjp has passed very good agricultural bills tone in which narendra modi name condescending and straight away reveals your bias but good that bills have been given their due
i farmer this very bad farmers should be allowed sell whomever we wants

government should obey demands of farmers they first peaceful and calm but there no positive response by government within 60 days omg so that why obvious be violating
continued started selling their produce directly mill owners from punjab chatisgarh mp these mill owners come directly and purchase stock from villages itself farmers do not need transport their paddy moreover farmers made instant payment almost 90 farmers sell their products directly mill owners and fci purchases very small stock so this both bills very good for farmers i do not understand congress which made promise in their manifesto introduce these changes now backing out this nothing but just oppose bill since against govt
kisan che j nathi congress dale hi
shameful no flag above our national flag these not farmers these khalistani suppourters
sengupta sir superb expllination by sir on 3 farm laws as we all know every coin has 2 sides in same way these farm laws has some pros and cons so when government thinking about double farmer income in same way for boosting farmers income they want private sector organisations come forward through these laws so for making balance in both farmers and private oraganisation these laws much helpful if there any problem in these laws then farmer should come forward and seat and talk with government government ready made ammendments in
india should recognize quebec sovereignty movement they persecuted minority in canada and we must support them
real farmers protest sidelined when khalistanis highjacked govt might be looking at bigger picture and something big coming this winter parliamentary sessions
regardless of whether new laws implemented from what ive seen that most farmers not that educated and still dont know how current msp system works we need educate more farmers
d right time use taliban against pak use money and free pak occupied land

i think have not heard mr arun jetali speech on these bills in european countries these bills already exists still their government spending on farmers survive them in those developed countries its not effecting then how can we expect positive thing about this in india modi decision nhi aur rahega jabse tabhise india aur vaaat lgi
inhone pathar mare police ko dikhao shi police ne good work unnecssary giving importance farmers importance should give other occupations equally
serious wrong decision but modi has do for elections
pakistan and china had strong hand in advising and helping taliban forces capture country
modiji should stop price hike adversely effecting economy of common men
laws may be repealed but they can be brought back with few changes so time frame must also be fixed this may be trick break up agitation so should continue until farmers fully satisfied
if i would read 1st and 2nd law together then as per already signed contract with company i would never loose penny as farmer either demand high or low in market its company headache not farmer not so then my income will not fluctuate
this means anna ji has not read farm law who fed these people acting farmers all year long bharat will know very soon
citizens of delhi should go and bring farmers inside delhi
this all political drama by congress party and farmers
mandis were monopoly through collusion between mandi buyers politicians and commission agents this more so in punjab both congress and akalis make money here if there alternative they lose their source of income as for commission agents they can work as agents for other buyers as well their role was going away anycase as with government enam portal sellers can sell online directly farmers can also form fpos instead of unions gain size and pool land produce what in demand there many successful fpos already and several farmers that sell online through agri startups who help package and market produce farmers have been purposely misled and most of them being not as educated believe their leaders same people who exploited them this completely political protest gain political mileage if not so called leaders would have specifically articulated issues and got government respond however they unwilling listen and demand repeal of most empowering laws in history of india for farmers congress 2019 manifesto stated they would abolish apmc act and its markets now they speaking opposite swaminathan committee had done consultations understood farmer issues and made recommendations government implementing recommendations
no farmers involved in these road blocks and illegal agitations tikaet getting funds from khalistani supporters from abroad congress party fully behind hese illegal irresponsible meaningless agitations by goons who just plan block india developments which very rapid and remarkable under modi government
people who voted for bjp also responsible for this condition of farmers and reason for ruin of country also bjp supporters
i hate modi i hate bjp i hate this current government
we support farmers proudly
lmao hindustan times forget pakistan your own muslim citizens celebrating taliban government
new laws not anti farmers just that more of experiment that can be implemented on pilot basis first than pan india
also one who says that they wont let host indian flag on independence day do really think they farmers
real farmers we always support u
they shot their farmers
we stand with farmers absolutely we thank for your reporting
so heart breaking behavior with farmers who give most impartant thing live
so gov compromised for few states disregarding rest of states in from south and i am farmer this really sad we were happy that there will be reforms politics failed farmers again
after watching your video now i feel its huge loss for farmers that bills have been repealed mobocracy should not get over democracy
how dare calling taliban terrorist where your baap made deal with them
reason why not good that private companiea or firms will exploit farmers and govt should find solution or pass resolution against exploitation
why farm laws have rattled lutyens media
sorry my mind still cluttered i understand how these changes good for farmers but then why farmers themselves protesting in punjab apmc traders and other middlemen protesting would be logical but why would farmers protest they just instigated by state govt who feeding them falsehoods that they will lose their msp
i am with farmer
we do not support such terrorist protests proud be indian
coming at minimum support price msp how many western countries can name following this practice probably none why because msp system against farmers how old say in economics demand raises price only licence holder traders or govt can buy farmers produce in apmc mandi no outsider allowed directly purchase from farmers leaving farmers at mercy of bunch of crook traders and govt remember govt would only buy that much which sufficient for population will not buy and should not buy everything
farmers have never asked for such bill
up unity brave punjabi farmers fighting for there right good luck
indiastandswithfarmers
if these people farmers then i astronaut
congratulations punjabi farmers they will become arabpati after bill back
amullah and masood leading towards their end as india trained afghan army forces but hands up before taliban can act
absolute power corrupts absolutely we all indians not only bjp pimps responsible for this even hitler was also good orator
i agree with most of your videos and content but farm laws were not that exploiting in nature there were provisions for farmers appeal land can never be ceased in contracts farmers form largest voting section i do not think govt that dumb that would let dm who point of appeal collude with corporate
too much indulgence of private companies in this sector biggest and most important might lead their monopoly over farmers which cannot be afforded seeing already bad condition of farmers
can explain monetary and materialistic loss of farmers then only indian can come know loss of individual
bjp will hold arminder hands and enter punjab for sure
farmer win power of farmer
i just read these comment thank delhi im so glad not fooled by godi media imagine government cutoff petrol stop farmers in up for protest what we going do when they cutoff food supply guess what increasing in budget phone cost and who gets that extra money abani winner
i do not what kind of farmers stay this long just protesting without taking care of their farm lands unless they not farmers
mr modi favours privatisation but his style of privatisation means give control only few who have deep pockets and who closer him u can analyse how competition being cornered from free indian markets and only few players growing and getting powerful
tm modi govt chathty rho zee news vlo salo tmny kbhi unemployment debate rkhy govt ky chamchy zee news vly kha sudhir chaidhary
what happened 745 farmers who lost life during agitation pay compensation them atleast their families god will punish
mr banerjee doesnt seems know much about this subject but has point of view about where wants go quite surprising for nobel laureate not be able articulate in substantive way indian farmers needs support system where long term storage of grains becomes reality like in west that way they can save their crops for time when there good price sell this how government can help build for long term solution
please save humanity i support innocent farmers we have right for peaceful protest
sad see protesting farmers in streets for such long time looks like indian gov ignored their demands plutocracy at work
apology farmers
why do not bring modi and yogi and amit shah criminal rss related data then we can believe jai bheem sat shri akaal ji
talking like police trah dudh dhuli riots ko support nhi aur insaan me saamil sjaa but atleast show or say that true they were tired from past 2 month and in this time they lost upto 80 farmers who will responsibility of that in all these chaos one who responsible media if media were showing truth nothing could happen what happened yesterday and respected sir saying hmaari traf goliya nhi chali lal kile kisaan mar gya aur kisaan foot goli maari gyi even tear gas 7 years expiry date which could be more fatal and could cause life
i do not support farmers here this nothing but goondas
interesting part that punjab government making cool 1700 1800 crore inr and using that money in own political welfare directly and indirectly all govts must be doing what sort of system we propagating really these farm laws shaking them now so good some thing good will come out but anti modi forces will have every thing in their mind but not interest of farmers and that will be challenge establishment hope some thing good comes out in improving our agriculture and crop pattern out of this
now society changing technology changing then why not farmers
changes were promised earlier changes were long overdue everything good will someone please explain how farmers going be protected against those who purchase their produce and simply do not pay
farmers after these bills would never be dependent on govt and may not force them for begging from govt
support farmers go back modi
zee news should change its name zee bjp news or zee mithya channel
entire northeast our farmers go for my dear brothers we alwys with my dad farmer and so do i
nb i not asking this coz i dislike farm bill just asking clarify my doubt
3 quality of crops by these farmers pathetic and surplus too and due msps government obliged buy them
i from farmer family based in gujarat i was lucky i got chance study in canada and also explore other countries around world farmers in western countries making millions and they work through system that indian government want implement
everyone in social media share videos which asks concern for farmers but if government bring laws change farmers marketing features we protest
instaed of that they have simply pulled back that after sacrifice of nearly 700 farmers
we must have 42000 mandis but we only have 7000 as of now government should work on minimising effort farmers have make sell produce they should strengthen apmc system by linking all of them through e nam instead of fixing apmc system they trying get out of agriculture
after great u turn from modiji reminded me of gandhiji famous u turn in non cooperation movement great modiji
farmers fighting for country
indian police plz support farmer modi murdabaad
modi government needs this kind of protest because they ignore farmers chhanga lag jai hind jai kisan
msp should be extended for private buyers too only then farmer can hope for some profit
this enactment basically can alter intended purpose of msp which provide safety net and can make msp as price floor such intervention can deleterious for agricultural sector as putting up price floor reduces quantity demanded significantly buyers of produce of farmers will not be interested buy at such high price regardless of how much farmers would like sell lower quantity of produce will be purchased this further creates obligation over government purchase all produce at msp price as demand killed by such price floor in place hence pumping fiscal deficit such move will effectively away chunk of total surplus of producers and sellers and will be against free markets working
7 18 that true and thats reason why farmers in bihar in extremely poor condition
i always support farmers
these factors will help farmers produce natural crops and will save ecological balance
nice informative video but left without conclusion 1 new farm bill better or worse for country who will lose who will gain please add this last part thnx
so in conclusion this protest had nothing do with farm bills but something that punjab wants for past several years and that their own rules and own country punjab either needs learn reform or india needs find other channels govt should not be forced pay for poor quality product just because of set minimum if companies ran show they wouldve had do things correctly and thats what these farmers all fear inability cut corners
goverment decided that only low income farmer get benefit of msp so poor farmer first get benefit of this
i always supported farmers and i will support farmers that
this law was good was farmers as said has nothing do with msp means they can sell at msp in mandi but everyone wants politics
1 farmers produce trade and commerce act 1 freedom of choice of sale and purchase eg outside mandis 2 barrier free inter and intra state trade 3 no need pay cess and levies 4 electronic trading transparency and tine saving 5 direct trading at farm gate cold storage processing units etc 6 elimination of middlemen 7 clarification by govt msp system and mandis will continue
if farmers stop farming there will food emergency just like in sri lanka v bad adminstration by bjp
yes i agree that whole world watching this all in shades of chinese presence at borders these farmers providing bread and butter this country of 1 3 billion people have mercy on farmers who out for last 2 months from their homes due some sound reasons
these not farmers these karyakarta of political party most probably bjp karyakarta in form of farmers they decleard farmer rioters and physical action against them
i am big supporter of modiji but today i feel that i lost i am shock with modiji decision i never showed weaker modiji like look today i am very disappointed with pm modi this decision provide every anti india elements like fuel now caa and 370 artical
and there used be minimum support price before this law opposition saying that govt will remove minimum support price and will not be good for farmers
do not be violent with farmers they real backbone of nation

some of burger boys were just so ignorant about situation and if we just see demands of farmers and behavior of government tackling situation in doubtful manner talking and at same time propagating confusion in farmers i think farmers right and they must block each and every road unless government listens their demands
why maharashtra farmers did not protest anna
even at his defeat not accepting that his laws were wrong rather saying that was right but farmers couldnt understand him
got emotional todaygod help farmers
why cannot amit shah implement yogi style and collect losses from people seen on videos bjp definitely part of this whole drama i think yogi only sincere leader left who cares for normal tax paying people of india everyone else trying appease these non tax paying freeloader gang of our society
i think govt insulted real farmers who did not part in this agitation
if government care about their people just they should drop this farm bill
in crazy democracy of india with election all year around hard work introduce reforms i do not think argument of getting consensus make any credible sense as indian opposition does not behave with any integrity hence delusional talk about consensus when opposition will do anything scuttle
thank so much lallantop for such amazing and realistic views of farmers
great news yogendra yadavji who great intellectual was born on teacher day soft spoken intellectual who tirelessly fighting with protesting farmers against 3 obnoxious farm laws passed by central govt hastily without serious discussion in parliament without consultations with major farmer unions which very unfair irregular disastrous for farming community in particular for people of country in general
i think farmers should make their own party instead of relying on congress or bjp they must stronger stance

principle structure of three laws were good but there was communication gap between farmers and govt

basmati rice 1121 being sold by farmers at rs 38 per 1 kg my friend works at trading company making bills of selling that same basmati 1121 at rs 80 per 1 kg and this without any processing people who auctions in apmc mandies and those who crop processing mills real culprits strict rules on how much profit can sellers make on crops necessary
anyway this repeal took too long due political interference from khalistani same tikait had praised new laws in beginning and opposition supporting strike for was their manifesto idea but bjp took credit so must be opposed meaning their manifesto idea had today failed by repeal easy blame modi not
ok if cannot support them but please respect them they farmer not terrorist indian media telling lies

what shame modi andhbhakts used call them atankwaadi andolanjeevi under influence of godi media without any of them actually visiting protest site
new farm bills more vulnerable monopoly atleast when know that there no limit on hoarding when there should be also like said that products perishable in nature hoarding only helps them exploit producers farmers even more for eg product with msp of rs 100 for once purchased at rs 120 resulting in maximum produce and sale let say twice actual demand remaining produce can be hoarded and in next season traders buyers can either refuse buy newer products or ask them farmers sell same products at half price because of their perishable nature farmers would not have other options but agree also potential players will be very limited and open market saying just gimmick because in beginning products will be purchased at lucrative prices which have never been offered earlier at prices which cannot be paid by others even with taking huge losses on account of buyers kill potential competition like happened in case of jio even idea and vodafone failed survive which other buyer can losses as much as adani in agriculture sector anyone and then when competition dead there no msp protect farmer interests mandis will close down eventually as they d largely remain non functional because of better deal from pvt buyers in beginning like happened with bsnl we already have seen such market disasters in recent times do not we learn anything from how can farmers survive exploitative monopoly which even idea and vodafone could not survive apmcs atleast in interest of farmers new farm bills actually make producers farmers most vulnerable in apmcs traders license given those who close state govts and govts changing keeping cycle running open markets with no law for msp unlimited hoarding and with giants like adani just delusional expect fair business taking place even in open market this monopoly worse by 100 miles when compared conventional system of apmcs

spoken like true novice farmer issue all about self interest of some people and political parties if was about good of farmers issue would have been buried
spiders trapped into its own webs will start blaming each others specially when khalistanis and pakistanis will ask for money which they spent on them
shekhar ji i believe we need another ctc explain why punjab and haryana farmers protesting new farm bills and who right and wrong and why on paper farm bills appears right for farmer but we cannot ignore mass protest as case of mass hysteria there few arguments from opposing side we cannot ignore matter not too trivial for large north indian community we need cut clutter and come out clean on what right and wrong with opposition of these bills rest of media too busy being influenced by either side
repeal law farms
that person killed farmers do not think any way let him of farmers killer on spot shoot them we all indian peoples stand with farmers farmers our lives without farmers we cannot go any step without food we cannot working for 1 hour all should respective them of farmers farmers life valuable than bjp antisocial criminal

these laws will make slaves of ambani adani and new laws modi making make monopoly in businesses read farm law read new working employment u will understand everything
farmers need their voices be heard and if they were doing peaceful protest wouldnt get media coverage be honest
another example milk which 8 lakh crore produce in india more than wheat potato onion rice and pulses put together in india why because anyone can buy whoever wants buy can buy directly and not through apmc similar thing getting implemented in agriculture
tikait so cunning and ganwar man that shining and politisizinng matter win election nothing factual content or reply has

base year for that data was 2012 13 and your base year 2018 19 so obviously purchasing has increased but olny produced total procuring data but how many number of farmers sold this at msp that didnt produce your research bit biased i think
kisan andolan support jar but these sikh farmer uncles motivates me am in tears how they struggling now am with u

bdi machine tractor or bda hathiyar or lath jb dono b kr skte h kisan ekta jindabad salute our farmers
thanks for video however i feel argument given regarding american corn farmer by devinder sharma may not right justification i think protest should be more about maintaining even battle between corporates and not letting 90 of agriculture fall into hands of adani ambani rather than rubbishing bills
at 28 minutes this news reporter suddenly changed his type of reporting once few farmers came stood near him gutless deceptive reporting
those laws were give freedom specially small farmers who could not get chance sell at their nearest mandi big farm owners used exploit them by buying at law price and selling in mandi at high price poor farmers trapped in this protest and again lost its war of freedom and development
hi dhiru i am modi supporter however i like your vedio

all activities would be commercial and farmers would be able earn maximum depending on demand and supply
god bless for your great efforts and dedication creating proofs show reality and truth of kissan andolan will be historical documentary about struggle of indian kissan against corporate markets
sir did not consider bihar farmers selling their lands and going punjab haryana and doing labor farming
bjp govt assumed that they can trap farmers in this bill

apmcs collect tax from farmers which goes state govt which then uses give free water electricity and get votes govt has also cleared that farmers can go civil courts

other states did not get opportunities as punjab and haryana but time has changed and all other states can produce as much as states like punjab and haryana as there no opportunity for marketing farmers do not want produce as they want contract farming good suggestion inter state businesses will give farmers great opportunity
now tikait should say sorry for death of 700 farmers on whose dead body has gained his political mileage
unite speak up against injustice unemployment rights save democracy save constitution live for humanity help needy jai bharat jai hind jai kisaan jai jawanthankyou very much for showing on ground reality of governance request government build more hospitals for better health system
response this agitation has always been dismal all knew that this politically motivated fake agitation all knew that this was threat national security too but modi was informed about not by national security agencies that looked so incompetent but by amrindar singh file modi let these guys go heart of nation and insult national flag because was politically motivated movement has not died down here protest much more important than welfare of farmers brand already formed will be alive by other flimsy demands
farmers can not go courts they will go sdm and dc
even after proof that farmer laws accepted by most farmers in india except for punjab haryana and western up as laws benefit all farmers except agents and middle men msp and apmc still there in writing even and govt willing go line by line laws which have been stopped for period of 18 months 24 months these kisans still protest they listen foreign and local anti india forces and arecwilling humilliate country that has given them so much sad that many of these people so easily manipulated
thanks all those supported farmers protest
common people should go against govt since all democratic ways not working with this govt brutal of haryana govt who blocking gateway delhi
now farmers have responsibility of not betraying those common people who have supported them by not voting for bjp
this sad that government have good bill for few farmers
one year and death of more than 600 farmers never affected government
as small farmer in up i am still waiting for selling my agricultural produce in market driven economy like industrial products has any state ideal system for agricultural production marketing which may be adopted by all states in agricultural sector which still employs maximum manpower
hopefully bjp cell warriors will still get their 2 rupees wage for all trash and nonsense they said about farmers and their demands all along
threat of farmers true
india needs those farm laws
more than 70 of people against these laws media owned by government that why reality not shown world people say that only 10 farmers of india protesting these 10 produce more than 60 of india wheat and rice
i trust those farmers will win do not harm police make your politicians accountable
last delhi election nara modi for pm and kajriwal for cm election cm pm naam

rakesh tiket chor
every body listern actual situation of india very critical modiji tried sale whole country reliance please support our poor farmers
all farmers in india sikh
i more in grey for this particular issue and i certainly believe that law not wrong if marginal farmer has remained marginal despite several decades then something definitely not working and needs be changed having said that government needs explicitly mention some special provisions for haryana punjab and up or states that witness procurement of rice and wheat at msp of over 70 so that we can balance issue of correct price but also put end trader nexus
days of bjp going end society must stand firm against bjp because country belongs society not any political party
thirdly very easy manipulate prices for pvt players once essential commodities act was passed and when apmcs closed assured msp will also not be available
as per my personal knowledge farmers bills most useful for real farmers but not for brokers unfortunately farmers misleaded about this bills
go yogi ji go kick out taliban support ers even tho i do not support bjp i support this
waste bjp and modi
fir against bjp minister son son still not arrested wah wah
since this bill came farmers loose everything this bill against farmers and good for big bussiness
big win for farmers
crux simple punjab nd haryana for too long have been given long rope by successive governments in form of buying almost whole of their produce at same time putting other regions at disadvantage
after watching this i finally understand why farmers protesting thanks vox

red fort there b coz of them then why should they not celebrate jay javan jay kisan why government not changed rules on farmers how more time they should wait more
salute all farmers
while farmers fears legit why fear about something that has not happened yet how do they know for certain that pvt companies will exploit them when bill has not even been put practice
i guess opposition leaders do not care about suv passengers who were killed they trying make this law and order issue as oppression of farmers by ruling party

i feel ashamed by watching our farmers condition
not good for nation where farmers on roads
currently am ca aspirant generally i am short of time complete my classes but i thought as citizen of india i should see this vedio
this was case with industries in india few years ago now just imagine if licensing of industries would not have happened then we would still be 10 15 years behind in terms of progress from where we now at that time too thousands were protesting against lpg act and guess what they were wrong
my opinion that we need consolidate national agenda enormously military capabilities being developed by china even americans have been pushed 2nd position with respect quad defense capabilities china also richest nation now punjab too precious let farm laws divide let consolidate face chinese might let move forward
these only north eastern indian farmers this bill was formed for benifit of all farmers but will inversely effect them that why they r revolting

farmer potato rs 5 per kg
i was angry on why vice have not uploaded any video on farmers protest

hail farmers
so if farmers sell directly traders how does gonna exploit them cutting out mandis and middle man profit farmers can get there true value of products and not recession by mandis
indian government must listen farmers and ensure justice what going on surely against democracy
canada leader great supports farmers
there india represented by tamil nadu and another by bihar they far apart on human development but both belong same india on electricity and drinking water fifth national family health surveys findings make clear yet again that there indeed two indias as comedian vir das has said in his own way india represented by tamil nadu has less than third of diarrhoea cases reported from india represented by bihar also has only 40 per cent of infant mortality rate and 60 per cent of fertility rate obverse that bihar has only two thirds of tamil nadus ratio for literate women or doctors per 1 000 population but 50 per cent higher ratio of stunted and wasted children
this not only about farm bills now just look how govt not ready withdraw bills when such huge number of population not agree with laws happening with farmers today but in future can also happen with other people or community modi sarkar busy with events elections and people who elected him as pm on roads
simple example we can from local vegetables market vendors as farmers and common public as private company when we see quality does not match with price we refuse buy but if quality good than we ready buy at higher prices i think fear producing quality crop
i have been actively farming for almost two decades now and i have witnessed many things happen at apmcs
why media on sustaining mr sitaram yechuri mr daniel raja by undeserved publicity do they represent people how many elections have they won
everyone should support farmers unconditionally farmers work relentlessly and produce so that over 1 2 billion indians can eat
should also make this video in hindi as if want reach farmers and educate them about these fears have talk them in their own language and most of farmers uneducated so i request please make in hindi
meanwhile in nepal sugarcane farmers do peaceful protests and get ignored but when political faction wants something for themselves politicians themselves protest in streets
well said covered though missed one another point as per indian constitution farming agriculture state list things where only states should make laws for them its not under central govt as example its like olympics association body making new rules for cricket which all cricket games will be forced follow in future when cricket not even part of olympics or under their jurisdiction and its governed by icc not oylpics association akhey khaa mkaaah
we support our pm long live india
why were people rushing should have let mr rakesh tikait speak more
has been victory of farmers against concerted campaign smear them as anti nationals has been wrested by farmers not awarded in grace by mr modi electoral compulsions compelled him we all see through this this will not work for modi
these laws repealed because elections coming in haryana punjab uttarakhand etc
farmers backbone of country going and no one can stop for your rights three farm laws of modi and bjp should be repeals otherwise protesting will be never end even after death of modi another bhagat singh will arise from punjab repeals farm laws of modi
so basically worried about monopoly in this sector well we already have laws for that if corporation starts exploiting of farmers or consumers then both will shift another company market competition needs be maintained and that where govt steps in ask yourself why internet in india so cheap because of market competition and buddy works wonders
farmers backbone of india and now time show solidarity for them
farmers pelted stones on car and everybody inside car was beaten death by this peaceful protestors just because people inside belongs bjp shame
when we say government should increase msp of other crops then there comes political baggae that government should increase msp which feeding most of farmers rather than those which niche
farmer needs reforms and support from governments especially
justice for farmers
crop diversification will be enhanced given today farmers forced produce rice and wheat which procured through msp mechanism other crops did not have this facility

farmers have become deshdrohis and rss have become deshbhakts issse bada joke suna
rakesh tikait says so simply and straightforward about situation
more mandis more buyers and therfore better price relisation not possible without private investment this fact
so conclusion new apmc bill good and progressive and protest false and misguided i agree from day one
no farmers no food
i saw every old people understanding situation better in video and difficulties of farmers
just opposite what godi media reporters act like just reporting facts not acting like others
appreciate your coverage but i think leaving out some of points being brought out by people like p sainath who have lot of exposure problems of farmers on ground for fair coverage should include his perspectives in your analysis as well
so sad central govt was forced for few punjab farmers could have adjusted laws some extent than repealing
pakistan transferring money canadian khalistani organization and where they both collect money and transfer in india for protest as well as in india money collected from opposition party middleman anti aliment muslim khalistani sikh
farmers would get abundance of opportunity
i thought farm laws will benefit our farmers save them from exploitation of middle men their dominating mandi system i do not know how minimum support price can harm them many time we have seen farmers crushing tomatos spilling milk bcz they did not get msp now what their objective i cannot understand
1 there no legality for minimum support price
i was always with farmers

learn this how suppress any protest well done modi ji

msp will remain in apmc even after these laws farmers still can sell their produce these mandis so why mandis will be shut down there only 23 crops which come under msp wht about other crops that why do not see protest anywhere else people who do not want enter contract farming can sell these apmc so what fuzz
hence rahul removed captain amarinder and forced him leave party and then negotiate with pm withdraw 3 laws pave way bjp win punjab elections
those farmers who want those 3 bill should start protest now
i supported our farmers till yesterday but
why do not they just let states choose if they want implement these laws or not if they work maybe punjab farmers will also join

these laws weakens farmers empowers corporates anti farmers laws
this death of democracy how can pass bill without discussion every members want repeal this bill last being bjp but what point in debating after bill being passed speaker should have allowed debate first may be for hour or two then called for voting and repealed that could have been simple

i got my answer for confusion over farm bill thank sir
farmers
most beautiful thing that stated those two points in hindi so that masses and especially farmers can understand great but cunning thing did that your explanation of all bills was in english which no farmer would have understood did not expect this kind of lowly rooftop journalism from person of your calibre please record this video in hindi and i would love see comments from farming community i appreciate print reporting but this video disappointing
few things need mending in this but overall these ordinances very good for farmers
shame on this government now we have anti national farmers also
but government not ending msp system opposition lying media creating sense of fear among farmers btw loved your video finally i can understand whole thing
ask daddy adani and ambani they will pay for any loss kissan mazdoor ekta zindabad
although u told about farmer side of protest incomplete people protesting actually not farmers but middleman who lot of commissions which results in higher price than farmer sells there goods
only little bit explained farmers just doing their protest peacefully but driver of thar hits everyone with car and killed farmers then farmers destroys their car in anger
let them live in gutter if they want was said by rajeev gandhi mohammad arif khan for muslim on shah bano case now i want say every farmers i did not get point while 1000 farmer were doing suicide in old system then how could be better system
bjp rss can accept anything but unity of jats and muslims in up cannot be digested by them that may be also one of strong reasons for with drawal of this black farm law
in last year 2nd season due rains and floods max produced crop was damaged and govt made purchase that with high price avoid backslash from farmers at end of year instead of supporting govt reduced max broken rice content in processed rice 18 10 due that we made loss of 40l in 6months happened every miller associated with apmc in

shame shame shame modi govt and modi media u all big liar jawan kirsan all this did by govt ruin farmers protest shame shame on u and govt
1 says whole india was against farm bill
think of as any other industry let say scooters in india its completely private millions of indian people need scooters and continue buy from handful of companies technically they could form cartel and raise prices together making massive impact in indian marketplace but does that really happen no because free markets also encourage competition and especially in today day and age if 10 companies come together and raise prices new company will get set up seeing discrepancies in margin pricing that they can advantage off of simultaneously if they prices artificially lower luring more and more people buy scooters they will have lower margins and b once demand picks up there will be more raw materials required up with demand which would put pressure on raw materials resources and drive prices back up again else will not be sustainable for companies begin with and they will go bankrupt if they continue sell scooters at lower price than what they can sustain
corporates will buy crops and store them but essential commodity act will stop them for storing crops for long time as increase prices in market
this why we need modi again slammed himself for people of india salute democracy
rubika hates farmers her face looks sad
support poor and peaceful indian famers 100
punjab has started revolution against this oppressive government
simple reason for poor display of our farming sector because apmc sham in our country corruption of apmc and cartel system has degraded extent that has become redundant i concide that msp required for corporate option of selling crops but we have understand that capitalism does work extent and competition in mandis can bring in change that much needed
why these people asking release sarjeel imam and all grandfather of these so called farmers
so sad that wisdom not descending on leaders of nation letting farmers being pushed into full revolt farmers have all rights eat good food wear good clothes enjoy best life can offer as nothing matches hardwork they put in feed nation
0 01 of all of indias farmers protesting just because there 250 million doesnt mean they all support same thing lmao extremely small percentage of them actually protesting western media trying amplify numbers portray indian government as oppressing farmers bjp government has contributed great amount our country in past 7 years of its administration than previous administration did in its first 7 years progress being made choice up whether want accept or not stay open minded not blinded
and stop stereotyping that farmers always on their fields i am also farmer live in city and visit my land only on sundayd
govt of india should allow tikait linger agetation upto time becomes alone after election of up election ends income tax ed should be allowed inquire his property
this guy totally uneducated useless ask any questions about farmers just wants cook own i heartily respect reall farmers jai hind jai bharat
they not farmer they our pride
farmer protest jindabad modi how dare da that
9 00 farmers suspicious
hypothetically for moment let accept abhijit argument by his own statement captain won only 800 votes hence coalition with him would not result in forming government would bjp especially motabhai repeal 3 laws for such small gain this does not really add up there ought be other reasons
farmers must now wait for its formal withdrawal and inclusion of msp as per swaminathan committee guidelines which into account inputs of farmer like his labour etc should be included as law
we support kisan andolan
2 10 create parallel system give farmer more choice
this not just problem for indian farmers this problem for whole world stand with farmers
i think many farmer leaders will see this video and then conclude didi had made amazing video for understand this chaotic protest of farm laws
i had loan as my income in 2012 but now i am in loss 5 lakh per year think about marginal farmers who have less than 2 hectare how can they pay off their loan when there income not expectable only way they see sucide
its clear modi govt does not want give money poor farmers normally center has give compensation farmers now govt does not want give that on top of that making easy for crony capitalist like adani procure easily at cheap price and sell other countries
america pakistan iran and arabian countries supporting taliban
farm law was for benifits of 80 farmers of india
boooohot der janaab aate aate hundreds 7 of farmers have lost their lives in agitation
bjp mistook farmers as shaheen bagh
proud farmers
this has reached this point because of bjp always worried about votes and not taking appropriate action at right time farm bill was passed in 2020 which in fact hasnt been implemented yet question in sane mind would be then why sometime violent sometime peaceful protest continuing since then by select group of farmers and that too in 3 states
which farmer alliance support these suspicious laws
modi govt wise repeal farm laws but was foolish have enacted in first place
power of farmers
hon ble ajit anjum your true journalism services rendered farmers and public welcome
no farmer no food no future
they looking like farmers looking like goons create nuance
sincirity of modiji our beloved priminister cannot be doubated vested interests who involved with foreign divisive powers playing game of kabbadi
at end of day when going sleep no one really cares will show no impact in any elections by way i have doubt farm laws same through out india then why there no protest in uttar pradesh karnataka madhya pradesh gujarat etc against so called govt
farmer watching debate in parliament what talking
1 contract farmers can make contracts with farmers without farmers having any legal protection appeal farmers will have abide by fine prints in legal contracts which even educated people like cant fight with big corporates
what this video doesnt say mandis functional and well working only in punjab and haryana and few other states whereas in other states farmers sell more of their produce private players technically all this protest mainly in places where apmc strong
thnku sir sporting farmers
yes rich politics has won farmers have lost
if they win punjab highly unlikely they will win only because of repealing these three draconian farm laws
absolutely aim was always stating same modiji just proved aim right now we cannot doubt him i also scared abt his prophecy abt hindu decline as roman civilization ended hope wrong
well said rahul gandhi in fact pm should vacate his office more than 700 farmers died due this farm laws must be held responsible
communist flags eh farmers say eh do they know how communists treated ukranian farmers or chinese theirs
u r so inclined bjp govt 62 days and 140 farmer deaths later u still show farmers in bad light make video on why govt forcefully enforcing farm laws
maza finally congress found someone who can defend her self being indian
can i ask one thing from this that government should only one should protect farmers so how they can made three laws which affects farmers so i request government decision properly about this problems
pak stand with sikh farmers
this decision of pmo represents pattern for law change followed in opposing this farm law activities had been accepted and approved by president of india suprim court of india assembly of india lok sabha of india sansad sabha of india central govt of india and state govt its not failure of central govt its failure of whole system in india
if they farmers then they can do negotiate with government finish protest
2 i do not think that 2nd law will work as private company first wiil give good contract in starting but after some years they will think of there profits and exploit farmers
how can indian govt think that they will be able create maximum opportunities for betterment of farmers after restricting their right appeal civil court in case of any dispute with corporate houses
vital revolutions have started with domination of farmers since history history has repeated itself hope tortures these people facing will surely get compensated with justice they deserve and their demands fulfilled
i am farmer this isnt right decision
2 farmers empowerment and protection agreement on price assurance and farm services act 2020

if farmer protest then why putting flags
well done modiji we will see does our farmers need more per growth and that too directly their account jai hind
manuvadi bjp cowards have attaked farmers from behind at farmers back now manuvadi padmaja debate
core reason in manifesto that farmer double income by 2022 which cannot be done without disinvestment clear privatise agri sector give corporate n corporate collect foodgrains at double or tripple price whatsoever and give general public at high prices and pay tax govt so its win win situation corporate win govt win farmers somewhat win like rains of winters and middle class or common public losses everything remember even rice wheat has become non essential item as per these new laws there may be uncontrolled inflation
we support farmers protest
this talk important not only for upsc student but also for all indian farmers and protesters all facts of farm bills explained in so detailed and simple manner hats off sir
my dear indian brothers and sisters high time open our eyes please do vote for right political partiesmy question our bjp leaders that where democracy in our countryit says government for people and by people why government not taking up necessary steps arrest culprits involved in this murder case whoever might be minister or vip son law for all and should be punish equally if central government did not punish culprit according law then they murderer of democracy
government should strict action against these terrorist

really good episode explained clearly bjp should make guptaji mediator
we support farmers
these r farmers this channel has good viewership from bjp minded chutiya bhakts most of people of west bengal support farmers in red fort
police shut off internet and incited violence and led kisans in direction of lal killa there witnesses all this kisaans even caught policeman red handed in common clothes vandalizing police vehicles people should be aware police inciting violence kisans made some mistakes but their intentions good bjp intention beat and discredit no matter what regardless this andolan will not end just because bjp trying discredit will make stronger
tumhi bjp ko 2014 me support
even though i accept whole story i am just wondering whether cartel formation would be easier for corporate giants if they try control price in 4 phase with less margin farmers they can go other buyers right where irreversibly in this case
madam 2nd concern about arhatiya personal relation come on perhpas madam has not listened of suicide of farmers due oppression of informalised credit system
these laws could have really changed face of our agriculture and primary sector let real farmers know what have they lost
modi actually clever topics which sensitive or important but things proposed in new bill or amendment disaster
6 also i can understand that they arbitary way laws were passed and how govt added fuel this fear led fire by not letting farmers protest but laws okay
omg this not good i support farmers
after sacrifice of 650 valuable lives of farmers abolishing farm laws
instead of subsidies better give good price for farm products
save india save farmers
hell of that bjp walas really beleive in their very heart of hearts that them staying in power in as many states as possible and in center what nationalist hindu not only wants but should want does not matter and should not matter that they will sit in their kursi and do ditto congress governance according them and their masterstrokevadi supporters
very clearly explained sir but govt should also step explain each every details of this bill our motherland farmer so that no one can misguide them
so can please also explain why mostly farmers from punjab only protesting against laws why do not highlight real reason behind such conjectures of fear why do not highlight what condition of farmers were during time of congress government and also please tell me who farmers actually spoke

proud of u sis n love u lot we feel proud we belongs sikh family kisan majdur ekta zindabad no farmer no food respect farmers
congress cancer india they have problem with development of country as there colonial master will hang them if they do not protest and unable distable development in india
this time image of 72 years of india damage and just like america people damage government and private property and shame farmers that they want there rights but what about those who works there i think that amerging india became destroyed india please spread peace and blessings and i hope this will stop and everything be normal
its funny see urban elite yapp at how these reforms were necessary without knowing damn thing about problems of rural india unlike propaganda makers that said laws would help poor farmers and only rich ones protesting quite outlandish make such claims small farmer who needs assured procurement and mandi rich farmers have their own silos for storage have access formal credit and enough resources build greenhouses and other expensive inputs rich farmers have capacity on corporates legally unfortunately rich farmers not so numerous even in prosperous regions of up haryana and punjab
how many days farmers fighting north atleast these in mind not only religion
for unbiased version of repeal of bills please refer shekhar gupta print also leftist will bring more clear picture than this one
withdrawl of laws big loss indian farmers and common sense big win for anarchists and those who wish farmers in perpetual poverty now no politician will dare reform this sector
farmers protest political issues for congress opposite party
i stand with farmers rights no farmer no food
why not in maharashtra where farmers have been looted by pawar and sugar looby
so how can government win trust of farmers
i will embolden farmers become rulers of world
people should not block public roads acts against publics freedom travel on road instead block people responsible for this bill and people in power
punjab has highest average farming household income in country at rs 2 16 708 per year while bihar has lowest at rs 42 684 per year
have given verdict against modi govt
its shameful for that we having such leaders would probably 2 3 minutes completely remove barigating and march upto rashtrapati bhavan its kindness of these people that they not doing anything its agenda of polititians poke farmers in hope that they will do something and godi media will make move out of
soldiers and farmer not just words they reason we living
talibani farmer
kisan tractors march zindabad
every thing ok but stock limit imposition exempted for corporates having better cold storage facilities as per 3rd bill what happens if corporates buy all commodities say onion and store with themselves obviously supply will go down in market and ultimately corporates will fix price as they desire this gonna happen and govt will not come rescue in such situation we consumers need carry this burden on our shoulders
so much enemity with farmer please corporate sectors this government sold
true indians will not forget this betrayal by modiuddin khan
abhijit iyer mitra was quite on mark point at ignored area i e underlying reality that today punjab heavily controlled by khalistanis in canada and uk threat indian governments both upa and nda underestimated and that khalistanis that fund and not other way round
farmers deal in favourite concerns of need kamaal
this victory socialist secular india no privatization no corporations no modi
i think modi will privatize all govt property and even land and all privatized railway as cant handle privatized roads as unable handle privatized airport as cant handle anymore if cant handle indian all property in well desired way let him come down from prime minister post and give chance others who can handle well can properly handle broomstick during election only govt just collect tax i have never seen such shameless politics how bjp doing now days legal corruption congress also did corruption illegally during their term
police farmers soldiers fix this corrupt leadership ruining country
know in currently farming law running from 70 years farmers killings themself they do not get price and they have no choice just throw their produces on road
also apmc has no monopoly said in bihar anywhere in india farmers independent they can sell their crops anywhere in india
election coming hi they losing but sad so many farmers died coz of him farmers should wait before doing anything because we cannot trust feku on this
now indian farmers could earn equaivalent american farmers now
i in pain after watching this video because i some months ahead and no one listening farmers
full support for farmers from all over world
i dont know why everyone connecting farmers protesting with this revenge
farmers issue has gone too long and congress and other parties taking mileage out of as farmer myself and n kernels we prefer option sell out products where ever we want i think middle man sponsoring agitation
new indian farmers politic party good free job
our country only listening punjab and haryana what about others who appreciated laws and earning benefits from
farmers have every right protest but they should symbolic with less people and follow protocols this way struggle also can be sustained until success they have shown how they count in wb elections
yes nothing but election factor behind repeal of farm laws
msp if given should be for all agricultural products for all farmers across india not select produce in select state
that reason called taliban khan ofcourse talibans pakistani army so will talk good about them as they actually pakistanis
always monolog that speaking from some other planet no idea about ground realities and farmers sufferings jai hind
actually modi government was too adamant actually bjp always doing favour for corporate
really again with u belgian farmers
congratulations all farmers and citizens of india bharat
salute all ndtv reporters anchors for being part of this farmers victory
my view something different in fact in every gram panchayats cold storages godowns and co operative societies ne established by govt rate of each and every agricultural products be fixed by govt and co operative societies shall buy those products at that particular rate from farmers farmers may sell their products in mandies also if they get at higher prices again these products be reached consumers at reasonable price small retailers will sell consumers so retailers shall buy from co operative societies at fixed price above buying price of co operative societies retailers shall sell those goods at rational price keeping margin of profit for their activities law should be in that perspective so that thete will be striking balance among farmers societies retailers and consumers
can experts here tell me point wise benefits of these laws for farmers and also address apprehensions of farmers regarding these laws
people of up said farmers happy its rakesh tikiat whose jumping
modhi right on this one by curtting welfare from farmers
as sdm taking right step i support him saale kisaan tode aur hum sarr tode fake farmers
make video on loopholes of farm bill
modi u will pay for dis poor farmer so sad fr dem
canada needs stand up and voice support for indian farmers
remain in power this another bluff master stroke govt has lost farmer trust already calling them as terrorist while terrorizing them
back 3 farm laws we support farmers
govt beating every section of society with same yardstick but farmers not corrupt nor theives nor defaulters
reforms have place in all fields in past 70 years except agriculture these 3 laws attempt make farming more competitive but unfortunately backed by political parties some farmers unions have opposed without reasoning good opportunity lost now farmers cannot come out of clutches of middlemen
attacking farmers who work hard feed shame on them
indian system in not honest with farmers
do not call farmers
we stand farmers
farmers have right protest please give them passage go
these r not farmers
1 farmers in pb hr get free water and electricity but not in all other states
disgusting those farmers only asking for their legal rights and if indian gvt not taking them seriously they will have do something like dat this media just like media in our country working for money gvt and not for truth
prashant read news on of adani group tried squeeze apple orchid farmers when they got push back and gave them fair price got show how big corporate can exploit small farmer
full support strong support from indian muslims our sikh brothers and farmers from all over india
thanks for support farmers
i do not understand why people liking this video if they supporting farmers liking video means appreciating news anchors
thing government cannot make up money and increase earnings of those farmers because rise of gdp india cannot cover rise of population therefore they will only become poorer and poorer
my grandfather also farmer
shekharji only mistake was lack of parliamentary discussions but that should have been forgiven as these were for greater cause but people were against cause of misinformation opposition and farm leaders destroyed india
firs modi destroyed economy with note then modi destroyed small businesses with gst now modi try destroy farmers with these bills with these bills big businessmen like adnany abany tata birla will be able buy crops at lowest prices because farmers do not have logistics or resources sell there crops any one besides these big companies and these companies will buy at lowest cost and store crops sell when demand at peak and these companies will export crops international markets that will cause food shortage in india and common people will suffer big companies benefited from gst became small could not stay in business and now that business gone abany and adnany labour class got destroyed with note
please post video on why farmer commit suicide
proud of every farmer and every voice that speaks for
i support sikh farmers from indian occupied kashmir
all farmer products should b 3times more than present prices
india trained these soldiers just show that they helping afghan so that they will gain sympathy and can use afghan soil for anti pakistan activities
shameful act by farmers
we all muslims stand with farmers
now wait for all those godi supporters call farmers khalistani terrorists
but why in first place international prices low because foreign governments compensate their own farmers by giving them hefty subsidy and what else indian farmers asking give compensatory subsidy if produce sells below msp give assurance they want be law not verbal or written guarantee they as we commonly hear them have had bad experience with past promises and meaning twisting tactics of political class
that 500 farmers arrested in karnataka screenshot fake 2016 news
union minister of home resign immediately modi sack him
congratulations dear farmers hope msp guaranteed as well there no catch here
bjp goons killed 4 innocent farmer shame modi shame yogi
if this was pan india protest why there was no one from large rice producing states like andhra tamilnadu karnataka bengal did not join and agitate for full year this not indian farmer agiataion but agitation of farmers belonging two and half states of india who would lose their source of income if government stops mandi press also silent on funding given from extremist organisations in canada and uk without which these agitations would have run out of steam in long run press should also look into funding received by these so called indian farmers
with withdrawal of this law farmers of india became one step behind from path of development
all other news channels giving punjabi farmers protest tag as khalistani movement ndtv only news channel who by people not government
62 days even after 70 deaths farmers peaceful protest
supremecourtstand4farmers

well its very obvious that such situations would definitely occur due selection of present govt by indian people there no any progress have been seen in any sector since govt have came into rulling infect well performing sectors have been shut or sold off by govt sad see our nation farmers on road since so many days and no resolution came yet
govt gave best offer postpone for 3 4 year and talk out and now getting clear all about getting power tikait dakait fought election and get zamanat jabt
my grandfather used say that once in your life need doctor lawyer policeman and preacher but every day three times day need farmer
what about martyred farmers some compensation mandatory

3 how come so called supporters from canada germany italy where number of khalistanis live actively funded by pakistan were barking their head off about matters they have no business talk about they not even indians maybe these farmers have one family member as khalistani agent also
i am not blaming these farmers i am blaming those political leaders who misleading them and giving them misinformation and misinterpretation of farmer bill and making them think that against them
thanks sir for giving relief our farmers
my father also farmer have not any problem this bill said good move by government and also we under kisaan krishi yojna govt give 8000 for buy seeds that why we don t oppose our govt this 8000 comes every year with respect crop season 4000 in first sixth month and 4000 next sixth month so definitely good move
2 new bill has not brought any major drastic changes only parallel system working with existing system prior these bills farmers can sell their produce t only govt markets
plz do in hindi and telecast so that farmers will understand good move by our government
this gentleman gurcharan out of touch with realty 90 of protesting farmers owners of less than 5 acres not big farmers of punjab as says

congratulations all farmers they proved how important protest in democracy
many important bills including three farm laws that were repealed recently did not get discussed in parliamentary committees
year long battle ordeal of kisan against blind deaf ruling class will go long way in history of working class of country

bjp rss government links taliban afghanistan

according your captions only cause punjab and haryana receiving maximum subsididity of india agriculture budget why not equally distribute among all other states
they behaving like roudys not as farmers some of them
not only politics manifestatiin of farmer distress that has got perpetuates over years
unity which being painstakingly being built by kisan groups against divisive tactics by various politicians be show cased and protected because that will definitely be targeted
3 traders who buy from farmers would not be punished anymore for holding stocks that deemed excess
only 1 5 crore people pay tax on their income but farmer has pay taxes cesses and other charges on his produce what kind of equality this 85 r small and marginal farmers who lack access formal credit and alternative employment this reason for farmer suicides
1 usa created taliban against ussr
air support could not stop taliban for 20 years what can do now just minor roadblocks
aim talks as if knows everything reality that no one punjab needs be secured wait for plan b from modi think tank think modi liked this communicate we facing larger issues which need priority attention
unfortunately many farmers not well educated enough so wrong minded people mislead them for their own benefits even i was thinking that bjp has done something wrong because of which these people were protesting well i still do not understand their point what do they really need
i in uk and interested in what going on with farmers trying understand laws or reason why farmers protesting not simple as your reporting shows complexity and nuances of situation very well considered impartial reporting style thank

farmer like another solder of india who feeding police throwing stone on them its not fair
farmers of father of national
support farmers
sir u said in start that farmers can sell their crops only apmc or fci
i could not understand anything about farmer protest for months from indian news channels but understood from 8 minute foreign news media
3 framework for contract farming first contract farming totally voluntary usually takes place between buyer and seller farmer for specialized commodities for meeting niche markets such as baby corn special varieties of capsicum etc formal contract farming has enabled farmers offer produce at predetermined price and for market price above contractual price farmer has liberty sell at higher price small farmers have benefitted more than large farmers in contract farming as income derived per acre was highest for small farmers experience of baby corn and vegetables
farmers should stick together for their rights dont give up
i also disappointed by repealing these laws but modi available best leader we should support modi in difficult time
stands with farmers
i stand with farmers
we cannot ignore corona very risky situation for farmers police forces i hope government and farmers will come decision soon
terrorist organisations has no fixed policy they must change at any moment we must support afghan govt
this very selective interpretation of farmers concerns punjab haryana hi bulk of that 6 farmers where apmc functions largely as intended that why they better off than rest of country farmers
first of all congratulations all farmers of india great achievements that will definitely became memorable in history
wow worried about farmers of different states but not doing anything for people of his own state what aqi of delhi mr cm

one of most important aspects of agricultural bills which needs be highlighted may not be fully addressed with these bills farmer will be ruined and next time up consumer essential food items like flour rice oil fruits vegetables sugar molasses will be monopolized by corporate instead of government they will be allowed stock everything under these laws as your kitchen items now out of essentials have done

free markets exist in theory because fact of oligopoly power nor factored in case of ola and uber also remember milton friedman was paid by large corporations btw introduction of base price or at least indication by government of their willingness introduce one in case oligopolies start their round of cartel formation outside mandi only safeguard i can envisage here that crux of most farmers demands also pepsico controversy still lives on in memory of farmers in punjab and haryana and other places so that explains their scepticism towards contract farming also in places like west bengal and kerala where land reforms were implemented really possible for contract farming shape at stroke of pen this system could have only benefited most farmers from these regions if cooperative systems were first established and then they were allowed profit from and through forces of market

very good clear picture of government ruthlessly ignoring protest of these peace full farmers
repeal of these bills good but i think caa article 370 necessary for our country
if these guys really love their motherland back home then they should demand that farming practices in punjab be changed because way farming being done in punjab being turned into desert currently fci food corporation of india guarantees buy wheat and rice no matter how much these farmers produce this has led over reliance on these two crops alone not mention immense amount of water and fertilzers farmers use for these crops as repeated growing of these two crops alone has severly deprived soil in punjab of minerals and water especially water as rice water intensive crop and punjab not naturally suited for growing such huge amounts of rice

in 2019 2011 2013 on 1990 farmers were supportin this bills
i think bill must be in recommendation of states interests if panjab haryana not happy with this law then let go donot implement forcefully on them and if other states fine with this new law then implement only on that particular states why dragging people on road and why they have die that not how democracy regulates farming conditions different in different states atleast centre should explain everyone about their new law whatever and if some states not happy and afraid of land invasions by corporates then donot force them in democracy we cannot force on people something out of blue i think govt if still want be in their seats then can do this much atleast

mister i want rectify your information regarding sell constraints on produce farmers can sell their crops anyone either outside apmc market or private buyer on his her choice as if price offered outside more then farmer can sell outside on his own risk of fraud dealing but inside apmc market there almost no chance of fraud happening apmc act as shield farmer

i wish had done bit of research with farmers on ground level instead of stating these statistics in order justify these black laws farmers grow wheat and paddy because of sure shot income guarantee and yet they pressed in debt and farmers suicides rising day by day if they away procurement system that guarantee will end idea of this law seems wonderful on paper but each and every farmer in punjab has had worse experiences selling private players and contract farming eg pepsico buying potatoes this reason for wheat paddy cycle continuation
jai kisan withdraw anti farmer laws at earliest unconditionally permit farmers tractor rally

i hope pakistan taliban break this mental slavery in pakistan too
why i am in very much okay with bills due attitude of government and their idea generally introduce bills first and then see what problems they face and fix or amend them as soon as possible hence why gst now stabilized

why farmers not telling bads in bill and just wanted took back

these not how strong they this how talibanism that night shown by barbarians where civilians suffer this talibanism of sikh khalsa disguised as farmers must end or should be ended by every means by imposing law and order
i am not quite sure if govt actually bowed down farmers and sikhs or khalistani and middlemen hope former
we small farmer and we never stored farming products in our house we have sale immediately because if need money and lack of store facilities so wholesale and big business man can store goods for long time and they will sale for high price

one thing i would like tell that during mandi system there was no assurance of msp and if look at rules and regulations will that msp was never legal mandate however current farmer bill will enable corporates exploit that loophole great advantage
if farmers decided stay poor let them be who cares let status quo get maintained and people like rakesh tikait enjoy luxurious life
these untoward incidents will be used by bjp their advantage any riot or form of riot in bjp ruled states have got them more votes gujarat best example mire media exposure counter productive
i have been staunch supporter of farmers protests but this very bad timing please go back do not be one more superspreaders

first of all nowdays in india all news channel or youtube channel covering news in particular point of view like pro modi or anti modi
shame on zee media for showing this video in favour of state government
and shame on fake farmers
i condemn govt action on honest farmers shame on govt
maximum damage has been done farmers there was no way for govt no proper debate or discussion in parliament great victory for farmers their will power must be appreciated at last bjp scared face forthcoming elections pm could have talk farmers directly but was adamant and arrogant on his decisions
aim quite hurried in his analysis changes these farm laws unfurled here stay farmers have tasted free market prices and wont back down his listening stopped at laws being repealed and missed out on zero budget farming this will reduce dependence on fertilizers and more breath and listen modi again who hurting more with fertilizer overuse who losing money by not selling in marketplace whose health will improve with zero budget farming practices punjab farmers all around will continue benefit with reforms but there more at play bottom line farmers will continue increasing their income and other issues will be dealt with so breathe in and breathe out
many point have been ignored from farmer and labour who already left protest
pm needs strict action against perpetrator so that faith in law and democracy restored as far as zee news concerned shame on for manipulating news and fabricating false narrative of horrifying incident

big win for farmers
mismatch of supply and demand will be reduced since farmers will produce per negotiated contract over production of agricultural produce will be minimised

c khattar correct if we farmers were his then should not have acted against c acting in favour of corporates

what compulsion now do not care when farmers in minus 20 degrees just conclusion that elections important
i recommend watch ias drishti channel get complete understanding of these law as far i understand our agriculture need these law yes not completely flawless many things need change as per farmers need
ego of bjp problem they themselves accepted that laws were not good and should have been modified but were adamant not do so
yes rightly said job loss of commission agents then should be protest of commission agents everyone needs pvt school for their children pvt cabs for travel and prefer pvt other thing but when comes farmers some of people wants protect own rights and saying farmer protest even this videos not covering all aspect like corruption of fci and wastage of grains and selling as scrap for liquor bahoot corruption
farmers have lost their growth potential
disagree with your point number 1 farm laws good such big change has be evaluated and intention and expected impacts needs be considered and proved maybe in one state really show they good no one can deny that bjp has brought these laws with shady intentions why use ordinance and looks at rajay sabha vote and farmers concerns valid intention its no different than looking at demonetization and saying its very good and look where got
farmer bills beneficial for poor farmers only mafia kind of farmers at loss so they jittery
manish ji analysis good make this video reach farmers and villages

greetings all our valuable farmers
for first time in their 6 years of governing country with absolute power bjp has shown little bit of concern truth imo that this protest successful largely because of sikhs they come together well as community and with other indians they hardworking freedom loving well disciplined soldiers loyal their cause and typically loyal their nation i pride in them being my fellow countrymen my salute them i remain admiring south indian
i am with farmers
and few hours later his ministers said they can consider bringing in laws at later date shows two faced nature of modi bjp
this great loss for true farmers
appreciate your clear analyses some points have raised hypothetical and for possible concern by farmers however farmers should have listed these issues clearly on table when discussing in 11 meetings with government they also failed cooperate with supreme court setup committee may have clear picture but farmers union does not secondly what really happens in future unknown if there issue can be subsequently corrected as i see will definitely bring better income farmers my farmer relation very happy that middlemen who took 2 5 commission in past has been eliminated with new laws since farmers do not pay taxes on their produce this income major contributer black money new laws will control flow of funds because all goes direct into farmers bank account there more but i think this issue so politicalized benefits opposition parties who fighting for survival and therefore will this issue alive for sometime
they not farmers call them terrorist
watch with 2x speed tej modiji etna time nhi
nothing will works for farmers specially small farmers
very soon bjp will portray how d farmers plight during d ongoing protests melted modi heart and for farmers cell will call modi d messiah of farmers with various hashtags and as usual common man woman will fall for
people commenting on how noah should research about bills completely these guys new his channel this same trevor noah who stand up comedian same noah whose intellectual ability portray political scenarios of different countries was applauded man who runs daily show and has make sure that all facts states true well researched and unbiased if his thoughts and speech do not match yours do not blame him problem here that half population in india who knows nothing about farming against farmers just because they support bill i wonder what their reaction would be if they were in shoes of those farmers who protesting patience can only hold true if what fighting for for right
fact simple real people of india who have benefitted hugely from mr modis policies will vote for him in 2024 thats every household that got bijli toilet cooking gas
rakesh dakait took money from canada china and pakistan khilaaf kai saari fir darj declare shoot at sight of these modern day terrorists

all culprits including rakesh tiket should sue lroperly
does that second bill mean that before farmers couldnt sell their goods outside their states and this bill just enabled them
talking about modi ji govt then this govt who had looked into all matters
we can only hope for something better come but was not fair repeal 3 farm laws on demands of few
read in your own regional language along with english farm bill
2 concerns of farmers were logical too
msp that punjab hariyana farmers enjoys not available across india why
farmers want high prices producers
on one side guy who literally crushed innocent farmers roaming freely while such powerful leaders who trying raise their voice treated like criminals in so called bjp raj
not about farmers about anti privatization of local agri businesses for survival of local logistics jobs cleaning grain transportation storage distribution flour making roti making factories alcohol industries fears of collapse of mandi businesses
this year farmers republic day

modi planing for up election

new bill good for agricultural growth no worries people of political opponents creating mayhem locate lay farming into trouble people like dmk tmc sad yielding political advantage very good bill for reform good for indian agriculture i am agriculturist in pollachi coimbatore
why not talking about these framers killing 5 bjp supporters and innocent driver
thank sir for your comments on 3 new law on agriculture products but as economist i could have liked as simple explanation of acts its good and bad aspects instead of going history and systems in past english known very few should have been in hindi for farmers
we totally believe in modi ji god bless
i do not understand why middleman give less amount farmer even though msp fixed by govt not this open corruption
3 if msp was developed targeted at punjab and haryana should farmers there not be consulted when govt trying mess with that
modis whole political life has revolved around protests killings communal violence and hate we people of india dont need gujrat development model be forceful applied on whole of india modi should this lesson and modify his dictatorial thoughts
effect of flood and drought on agricultural produce which cause of suicide of farmers
hariana not separate country why they blocking march of farmers for their grevience

farmers protesting farm bill not only sikhs in punjab and haryana there hindu farmers sikh farmers muslim farmers in punjab and haryana farmers not only from from jatt caste or sikhs there also pundits brahmins and dogar farmers in punjab farmers feed nation big companies like tata birla reliance ebany adnany these big companies controlling modi these bills designed make each farmer compete against each other so that big companies can buy crops at lowest rate because farmer will have no option sell another buyer due lack of logistics and lack resources and big companies have logistics and they will buy at lowest cost from farmers and export other countries this will cause food shortage in india because big companies will able export crops more profitable buyers in other countries and food prices will get more expensive in india modi working for business tycoons and big companies gts hurting small shops small factories modi needs be removed from his throne
thank modiji for opening our eyes
finally kisan got victory
ego of this man gonna ruin life of poor farmer
as far as decision concerned i think pm repelled more because of upcoming elections rather than farmer trouble and concerns
sg typical of godi media
tikayat has reached such stage where ready say that his children children of his villagers does not know how many children has may tell that does not believe present children his if they let come from lab test from usa may say that because of farmers agitation has not been able see his children so his children should be made ias and each should get compensation of 500 lakhs each let adharcard and death certificate of 600 deaths be verified same applicable for rahul and nawab mallik
and system has build over time which profits few like middleman and rich farmers who farmers as they own huge land but in reality they employ thousands of small laborer in their fields every harvesting season but not who owns small land and few cattle those who owns agricultural land do not have pay taxes buying agricultural land and employing labor at lowest wages system in place which has many people stuck in deep poverty
if reforms do not come agriculture space and punjab then our agriculture going down drain and in terms of punjab there will not be any ground water left in 10 years if current practices not changes shame on these farm protest leaders
even if flag was not replaced how come religious flag not all farmers sikh
farmers should feel ashamed after doing this kind of act
after suffering for last 1 year travelling from tikri border gurugram i now feel ditched by farm bill repeal
ok with your reasoning for bihar but does less market price led change in cropping pattern in bihar and does that helped bihar farmer monetorly
ungrateful punjab non farmer agitation in delhi political gimmick no farmer need today free real farmers khuddaar original farmers need correct price for their product protection from natural calamities protection from insects etc all govt wasting money for free money giving farmers even god can satisfy farmers how can politician satisfy
congress coming very powerful for up coming elections

now that anti pakistani terrorists like ttp daesh isis bla which were funded trained coordinated by indian consulates having sleepless nights
these 3 laws for betterment of farmers some political parties and groups taking advantage of this protest
my dream unite farmers for making many more entrepreneurial ideas like amul
again loans will be waived again more subsidies from tax payers money again farmers suicide how can india develop
government spending taxpayer money pay msp price for paddy and wheat but our farmers doesnt want change crops patterns which completely unacceptable
this channal supporting bjp
why only punjab haryana and up farmers were vocal against laws while other major state farmers were unaffected

rakesh tikait zindabad jai jawan jai kisan this anchors trying his best please his masters chatukaar pattalkaar
contrary what claimed in this video farmers were allowed sell outside apmc private manufacturers thats how we have been getting products sold by dabur patanjali packaged chips lemon drinks etc such basic fact wrong in video and so many people now feel they understand issue
this sets wrong precedent that government can be forced repeal laws by having never ending protests motivates other non state actors outside of india interfere in our matters and give push 4th gen war

msp still there for farmers government has said this time and time again msp still applicable just that farmers have been given choice either sell their produce through corporate channel only if they want too their choice how can one corporate their land away level of misguidement of these poor farmers next level
seasonal spikes in prices of onions and vegetables have had causal link hoardings noticed during various state elections viewpoint that can be seen echoing on social media that laws bode ill not just for farmers but also for consumers aam janta who will have buy food at prices that big corporates decide charge since they have capacity store stock for very long and create shortage in market they will be legally allowed hoard food grains and other stuff
we support farmers love from kashmir

1 considering current sample from single state how does other farmers feel about laws
modiji have not heard adage vinash kale vipareet buddhi
aur punjab already contract farming h kerala masalo contract farming h phir desh level contract farming virodh
ignoring fact that farm law protests was funded by foreign khalistani groups foolish say least we ask know how riot was positioned in sikh groups
so punjab and haryana farmers producing these resource intensive crops like paddy sugarcane sell all government government exchequer bears all brunt ultimately common tax payers with private sector money flow technical expertise and demand they can start growing high yield crops benefit themselves and companies so basically haryana and punjab farmers want things stay as as they fill up fci quota hmmpf
i hope 143k people who watched this video will support farmers
some indians think justin trudeau support khalistan movement but this not true because not only khalistan movement active in india and more then eleven sepratiest movements active in india like movement of christians in nagaland in india asam manipur etc
this decision of repealing of farmer laws again proves that
farm bills should not be implemented these against farmers boycott farmer bill
sudhir shambhu border v pakistan and india interstate border point
as for farm laws more vetting indeed required but regulation can also be brought on in increments by state or center as and when needed making conclusions right away without presenting any strong rationale or even giving any space people supporting these laws would not help improve vet these reforms or help those farmers which need most
750 farmers died then bjp react
farmers working on fields dalle sb
agree that msp also not sustainable alternative abolish msp and increase subsidies on farm inputs like fertilizers seeds pesticides and encourage collective farming at panchayat level whereby productivity multipliers like tractors harvesters etc costs of which can be shared by whole village equitibly govt will get more bang of its buck this way
those who support taliban should be sent afghanistan
this decision gives government opportunity refine these three laws and address those concerns raised by these farmers we will definitely see new and better laws coming
global security bill in india
what about pollution in delhi its because of farmers supreme court has asked them not burn but they still do if corporation owns land government can fine company which not possible with individual farmers

4 why farmers not allowed go court in case of disputes whether they can afford different question in case of serious and mass exploitations farmers can group together and try go court but limiting them dms level too much autocracy esp kind of dms who say break their heads should know in case of dispute they will money from jio and give resolution only in favor of jio forget justice

thank vox for giving this indian issue worldwide fame so that government can face international pressure and deserving farmers can win their worthiness
i completely understand protesting farmers point of view but thing understand that farming not same through out india for example there parts of india where farmers have plenty of water through out year and there parts of india where droughts so extreme that water transported these places through water train in such draught stricken places privatisation would help farmers different parts of india have different needs
all those who lost their lives during this agitation or protest should be remembered by constructing memorial mentioning their name and villages they belong this how country fellow protesters should honor them and has be engraved in history of india that farmer of this country stood for people of country and their livelihood
indian farmers learned fast from hongkong and capitol hill freedom fighters

but here point i want tell that my relatives in police force who were posted there for security and they told me that they have this information that riot will place 2 3 days before incident they were ordered let group of people enter red fort and not touch any of them as well place where farmer died actually there was open fire from police side which led death of that farmer from all ground report and my sources i have analyzed that was all pre planed between rulling government and some particular small group leaders like deep sindhu and some goons who now in politics with bjp support and motive was cut emotional connection of protestors and people in cities who were supporting them by providing facilities and after that some media houses started showing whole story against farmers
shame farmers voted for em now getting this
sahab your views true but make video on farmers issue and work of government on those

information from social media makes these chirkuts informed become expert on this subject i commend wire for framing question as suits its agenda these morons have zero understanding of farm laws but they will speak like expert this also speaks lot about level of awareness among people about things happening around
all indians can expect him form political party very soon sad congress dmk have started negotiations with him will have alliance with them very likely be employed divide vote rather winning election
india buckling farm protests
according my opinion as i have spent one year as visiting professor at one university in haryana problem private trading at wholesale market and entry of big corporations in agriculture which farmers do not like as they afraid about their future wholesale market must be in hands of government fci should extend minimum support price for all kinds of crops food and non food there should be new investment by government build new storage facilities more irrigation for whole of india this european common market agricultural policy and successful india should not follow american system problem in india that most economists want follow american system which not success they call introduction of american system as reform

contract farming happening even today infact all started from punjab first just that there very little regulation and lack of creates more disputes
i did not like sg version u actually justifying entire episode by proving government mistake but actually entire incidence not good for indian farmers and for as nation most of bold decisions made with iron fist and eventually people fall in line
problem way of implementation modi gov regulated things like gst and demonization which looked great on paper but failed in real life can farmers this risk with their livelihoods here
nice one conclusion new laws useful for betterment of farmers not perfect thank for not being puppet of ruling or opposition party this hypocrisy by opposition in name of farmers should be ended farmers should question those who oppose this law by showing facts this type of crocodile tears must be identified and be shamed
we eat because of farmers we have respect them and their demands

zee news hi bjp channel
modi should leave n pave way for yogi
i think this protest succeeded only because farmers over here were willing literally risk their time resources and lives block delhi borders till government relented urban middle class does not have social stamina do so unlike ruralfolk urban middle class concerned with earning more money and improving living standards so much so that they consider their time extremely precious this why state can easily put down such protests like what saw with caa
farmers need justice
but i do not understand while criticising modi was appreciating manmohan singh i think people supporting congress directly or indirectly even many people not happy with repealing farm including myself but that does not mean we should appreciate congress for 70 years of blunder
if can post this in hindi language and make series on educating farmers

1 farmers produce trade and commerce promotion and facilitation bill 2020
not exactly good bill epecially when produce such as wheat or rice could be turned into hard drinks coporates may even think of turning corn into bio fuels and this can cause food shortages however if farmers do want price discovery they can start forming unions
if they realy care for farmers they can make changes in fram laws and cover loop holes so that farners will be benifited
my grandfather farmer
guru gobind singh army i do not want live long i want live and fight and win god bless farmers waheguruji fateh
why did that one person die because did not know that tractors can tip over when turned around at high speeds protesters were not farmers but middlemen new laws connect farmers consumers bypassing middlemen that why they angry also managed bring in their nearly enslaved farmers enslaved due huge private loans give this agitation look of farmers protest plus whenever there protest in india against conservatives elements such naxalites khalistanis urban naxals separatists anti nationals dive in
with farmers

one could also argue case of indian airlines which was expensive and yet of substandard quality with new market players other private companies coming in in end consumers won today we have better choices and quality similar case of punjab farmers land not suitable for paddy farming but with highly subsidized water and electricity they growing at high operating cost this model survived by msp because that takes care of operating cost in this scheme other states which more naturally adept such farming lags behind and so quality of produce and economy
indian farmers will bring new revolution
modi has said consultations have failed convince agitating farmers consultations should have been done before laws were passed and by debating in parliament not by rushing laws within minutes where nobody has clarity on laws
relevant question has any organisation of farmers asked for such law for them
but issue we wont get any support from russia and have threat from pakistan and china combinely as well if was not case trust me india would have been invaded afghanistan by now wipe out talibans
remember farmers backbone of our country
i told bhagat singh was from punjab fight british and now whole punjab they have fight against modi
as being daughter of middle class farmer i think violence not necessary and we can solve out but neither government and nor farmers ready listen i live in punjab also and been months since this happening but me and my family not involving in this we belive in talking and solving this problem so both people and government can be satisfied hope this fight will end soon with peace
and might lose some vote in punjab which never got some districts of northern haryana and some districts of western up

many people dont understand that this very very smart move in way why because 90 of protests not done by farmers but hooligans and separatists its very very smart move show that its not bill that creating issue

punjab me 2022 me election
at 2 33 00 made nice story that farmers cant get msp in apmc probably just justify that msp waste so if there no msp by private players its justified but since knowledgeable person why did not also mentioned that govt have too many agencies deal with corruption so do want say that all those agencies does not know or they do not work or they know or do not work
i not economist but have read pioneering book by adam smith this bill apparently in line of suggestions by prolific author also talked person from agricultural background and they see nothing alarming in i personally feel bill will bring increased profit for farmers but agricultural labourers may not be directly benefitted from this hope farmers will increase payment for them once their own income increases but let get prepared pay much more for farm products now onwards

this fellow well oiled by funds elsewhere that can protests wherever directed by sponsors not farmers but trouble makers but only restricted one state and portion of middlemen

5 deregulation of food items there no deregulation of any commodity because there was no regulation of any commodity regulation existed only on markets in order that markets facilitate proper weighment proper price formation process however despite apmc regulation even this day farmers given bili chiti white slips which totally not transparent even after 55 years of apmc act farmers still receiving very low price share out of consumer rupee because of market inefficiencies and market imperfections and several practices such as undercover sales illegal deductions by merchants exploitation of farmers in interlocked markets cartels among merchants depressing prices and so on
shame on godimedia
i support farmers fighting for their rights but now no longer farmers movement
why not make ware house for farmers locally available store their products on monthly rent basis

thank so much for making this video amazing job at summarizing issues with farm bill
usa had signed agreement they will leave afganistan and will no do any air strike against taliban but now they violating agreement which they had with taliban believe me taliban will respond this violation seriously
proud of our farmers
taking side very difficult in this case because i feel bills neither too right nor too wrong just timing wrong before complete capitalism complete socialism important so that farmers can be united and their produce can be sold collectively after complete socialisation government can gradually sell out shares of entity private owner or many owners i think this will help government as well as farmers and help reduce loopholes
grand salute all our beloved farmers united we stand divided we fall
but i confused so this bill actually helpful for farmers and need be understood by them or not good
well i am impressed with wire they always try show exact things and issues in our society ma am suppose if get your salary of 2021 in 2022 same things farmers get their payment in next year
their reason why rest of india isnt very keen on repeal or pasing of this bill they have accepted farming as profession which pays by season according market while middlemen
finally farmers won
these not farmers they black mailers
farmers graveyard for bjp that why they trying every possible way dipress their voice get ready face heat
most of commenting here does not know how agriculture works and hard work we put and return kind of small very cleary we proposed 141 page reform about agriculture law which government never accepted they framed law and executed without considering majority of agricultural unions if see new law mostly favored private players no support from government everything depends on private players think what will happen india like country
its hard believe bjp accepted defeat so easily they known very calculated steps and decicion and they have enacted much more controversial acts than farm laws before its hard figure out what they planning next may be punjab election or they may ask bjp ruled states enact 3 farm bills seperately

i will say problem of famers in uttar pradesh that sugarcane uttarpradesh higest sugarcane producer their price low in up thts problem farmers facing here but unfortunately in this andolan noone talked about our real matter even in panchayat they said remove yogi or modi and so on bro u could have just asked for price increament i support farm law but there some mistakes tht needs be improved please stop playing politics with please
so new law allows direct consumer model that cuts out middleman how that bad entire world moving that model if given option i would buy directly from farmer middlemen should be optional i get logistics of selling can be overwhelming for small farmers but they can always form small groups or use middlemen if they prefer do so supply chain portion might be challenging at first but not impossible figure out this way farmer becomes their own boss
i hope silent farmers who have benefitted from this law for last one year will raise their voice atleast now
farmers asking completely repeal 3 farm laws despite govt agreeing most of their objections making this entire protests as politically motivated farmers behaviour making them as part of problem now and not them as part of solution
watch this video about ten years back mrs shushma swaraj was opposing vehemently farm reforms introduced by then congress party in parliament was telling what now panjab farmers telling
everybody should come with kissans because they fighting for common people majdoor employees students small shopkeepers of india and not for cheaters and lieyer
2 protest includes many genuine farmers with genuine concers but slowly being hijacked into political movement
power should be in hands of farmers
mostly correct bill with aim of doing something good in government pov passes without noticing loopholes has both positves and negatives government good in their pov and farmers protesting make this bill perfect with some outside interruptions that made indians go against indians

there lot more grey in this arguments being made on both sides what certain that government has not cracked down on anyone government has so far been very careful and respectful in maintaining distance tbh farmers also keeping non violent except for couple of incidences that mentioned and farmers detested and distanced themselves from those who did
they bunch of criminals who fighting for power in of farmers

why punjab n haryana farmers r only enjoying this facility from last 50 years
now every case of inflation and farmer distress will be blamed on farmer protest
first of all human by nature loves peace and secondly waging war against any nation or group needs investment be ussr or usa today we all know what had happened these countries lose people and money and nothing gained usa has invested 3 trillion dollars during these whole 20 years we indians talk about 3 trillion dollars economy but still we indians die because of corona if have lost some one or have watched news not desh bhakti ones i am talking about news which gives information not mentality of hindu and muslim then must know how many we indians have died during these pandemic we indians in 2021 struggling our gdp growth evidence of so waging war not option yes no doubt if we push really hard fight for then we can win war but post war scenario will be really different we may even become second afghanistan in world there will be civil wars and protests all over country we indians do not have put our nose in some ones else matter best thing we can do remain neutral and analyse situation as other neighbouring countries like china and pakistan doing we do not want waste money on stupid wars and give advantage other countries like china or any neighbor country and still if some people as i see here in comment section who wants show off by stating we can wipe out afghanistan and taliban for your kind information afghanistan has seen war for past 50 years and if good at history then will probably find out what advantages afghan people have in their home mainly geography of country and not forget that taliban could do nothing without local people support so what i am saying taliban has upper hand no matter if usa or india intervene thing that taliban does not want india involve because they do not want any useless bloodshed and matter of their own country if taliban forms government there in future then india should forget about other things and shake hands with them because our country has also invested 3 billions in developmental projects there i can go on saying about all these but i do not want because matter of debate who wins or who lose rest depends on your knowledge and thinking jai hind

plz indian support farmers
thanks all dear farmers fought bravely bring before truth this freedom fight
liked video but i do not understand how could justify protests protests against bills does not make any sense at all unless there some hidden agenda
but must needed understand why only haryana and punjab when there 2 cr farmers in uttar pradesh and 10 lac only in punjab
great way of explanation but i have one doubt if msp legalise than consider if more farmer grow wheat and in market surplus of wheat and consumer still have buy at high price govt ca not fix price price fixed by market self definitely govt need control cartel and corporate interference
no doubt hr community mulak chahye i am very very thankful my allah that i am pakistani and i am muslim rajput belong from india kernal
but reality of government controlled mandi that poor farmer usually forced sell at whatever price broker cartel at mandi decides msp usually comes when government procures directly through fci etc for perishable items like brinjal lemon etc forced sell because cannot produce back home
i do not understand smaller farmers will be screwed how does not have logistics funds get out of state and sell crop
i do not support modi but farm bill good bill well we need think more of market economy country rather than communist country where we give everything for free
one word say justice we stand with our farmers lakhimpur
in end u mentioned land ceiling act detrimental farmers how
8 bjp refused have debate on bills they rushed them through
i am just 17 but want stand with our farmers but leaders who having lot more brain cannot see there our issuse
i thought doing indian accent was racist and stereotyping or does not apply right wing supporters
priya i really admire your efforts in making this unbiased video but situation on ground different as customer i was charged 7 for buying flowers without any processing in apmc i wonder how much farmer must have paid
i do not support these 3 farm laws and also i did not support this repeal what gov have do make some changes in this farm laws as what some farmers demand like msp and all
not several states mainly punjab and haryana
small shopkeeper also sells his goods at fixed prices but single farmer only one whose crop price determined by other people why like this i am also son of farmer and support farmer protest
i had opinion on mr modi as leader who had guts this handling of protests just shows just weak like other mayawati jeyalalitha and even mamta banerjee would have handled this better farmers cannot on vandalising everything and govt should have guts use force bjp has failed and will appease any1 for votes
scrapping limits on storage of grains food allowing private companies store and raise prices artificially icing on future planned farming monopoly cake
bengal gone with farmer strike punjab out of reach and if up also slips out of hand modi sarkar at center will face difficulties that reason for this change of mind
taliban should their islamic rules back pashtunistan pakistan and other areas not afghanistan this oppression will not last afghans will not put up with this they will fight back where coward international community and united nations stop this garage why was this terrorist group ever allowed power

these laws bring indian farming in line with how canadian european and american farming done most of india has adopted these laws in one form or another punjabis most gain from current system and operating cyclic bi culture of rice and wheat that destructive environment they do not want things change in india and most of them moved from india avoid stifling market conditions for farming absolute fucking hypocrites
people do not wanna change in india grow harsh reality and your decision back these laws just open door for liberals protest against article 370 and caa look weak at moment
3 13 this bjp government versus farmers
either politician or middle man from sugarcane mafia agro reforms for benefit of farmers appalling that goi does not have knowledgable spokespersons in hundreds if not in thousands spread crisp and correct information about agro reforms
3 msp life line for farmers when price goes down below cost of production of course nothing has been done
4 reason of appeal not clearly told by farmers that why they need repeal msp or what msp already guaranteed so what they fighting for
salute spirit of farmers

kisan bills were also against constitution
in india physically handicapped pay income tax whereas even super rich farmers do not
when these bills so good and favourable for farmers then why these farmers apposing these bills as per these protest seems that these protesters not real farmers these brokers who wants earn more profits than real farmers who grows such agricultural products with their efforts i support these bills
such shameless anchor openly saying 700 shaheed farmers means nothing shame on
what bjp going do when voters who supported them feel like this
what guarantee corporates will not end up exploiting farmer
our farmers will decide whats good or bad for them
wow what clear journalism cant find this much information and clarity in our indian media

my god that india biggest democracy of world lol
let political parties listen and aware of these facts very important politics should not be in matter of farmers
india having 28 states and 7 ut now why only 2 state farmers doing protest not other 26 states and 6 uts this law applied whole country now understand chronology some countries funding for this protest
surely win for rich so called farmers who in turn fund political parties
if want really understand farmer situation then watch godaan of gulzaar was launched on dd all episodes available on youtube
farmers r our soul they give life n they like god n we have full support them
if as sg says present agitation not about farm bills but about politics then abovesaid strategy seems be best available option for govt not lose its face on ongoing agitation
they so powerful they made usa led alliance joke and lesson for other countries threatening taliban india should watch media and step back they do not forgive their enemies that taliban be aware
government too soft solve these problems government should clear all highways blocked by these so called farmers they not nationals by doing all these blockades they destroying indian economy
what cheap government attacking farmers that feed people where indian citizens hiding why i do not see them supporting farmers

height of misinformation spread by congress among punabi farmers
this more of trade of between security issues vs poor farmers financial security
through 3rd bill anyone can store any amount of commodity thereby increasing demand and hence leading inflation
some ppl saying this rich ppl not farmers
shame on indian government they do not understanding farmers pain they demand their own rights guarantee

farmers have right use vote politics card get their legitimate demands met by deaf regime of modi yogi cronies government has used every dirty trick malign weaken scare and harm farmers vote politics only appropriate tool left for farmers use democratic legal non violent acceptable in all democratic countries so they have that route media should not question or blame them this different than entering politics or contesting elections
damn damn gave me crystal clear vision over what going on indian media tweet fests going on and with everything else all seemed so vague thank for this video
respected shekhar gupta sir i am great admirer of your journalism and have been following your work from days of kaar seva when i was just ager sir with due respect i beg differ from somehow when say that bjp has lost this battle on contrary my view that if anything bjp has succeeded in so far strategy of countering anti farm laws agitation and i find this answer in your statements of this episode i agree with completely that his agitation no more about farm laws but now purely politics and i have my doubts that political pundits who decide bjp strategy would not have ponder on point that giving leverage of 18 months halting period could affect their upcoming elections in up and elsewere especially if we all know now that just politics about this agitation what i mean say that government knew very well leaders of this agitation will not accept condition of 18 months postponement of implementation of laws and they floated this offer with utmost care keeping all outcomes in view and by not accepting offer farmers leaders have actually fallen into trap i also have impression this strategy of bjp can even sow seeds of disagreements among farmer leaders though that just guess feel
i support farmers
now opposition will ask for resignation of modiji
very bad treatment with farmers
sad saw his own father killed infront of his eyes minister gunda son ni pariwar barbad ker besharm miniter beta ni kush thefamily looks middleclass farmer peoplemust help provide legal assistance fight for justice

in addition farmers must pay taxes sas of every body else contry runs on taxes

so these naturally hijack protest in which small farmers lost thier lives and those dalals won b coz country dealing with internal threats of these khalistanis funded by china pakistan
so good let free market work when governments set prices they ruin economy never works props india
u said that there loopholes in bills becoz of which farmers protesting but thing many farmers does not even know clear picture of these bills even many educated people then how come they so concerned about loopholes thing that middleman making political war and these farmers their soldiers in which most of them does not even know actual thing
plz reality show n tell media should support kisan
bjp has power eggo bjp govt modi ji does not measure strength of any political social andolan they always believe andolan altimetly collapsed but they wrong they have no management how takle kisan hesitation now all poltical party shooting in back chanel kisan andolan make more trouble in future
no public was reported hurt sad 24 year old protestor was shot in head all criticising farmers should go and find out who that anti national criminal who shot him again should appreciate effort and just try imagine kind of great risks farmers took should be brave and should posses quality belive in cause spineless people lwill never understand that so do not bother

this protest so wrong and now proves that its all politics they just want ruin very important day of country and its so sad see i just wanna ask that where these so called farmers minister who said that they will responsibility and will do quite protest i oppose this protest and tractor march jai hind
im my mphil research understood market only increase productivity but had hardly benefited farmers
unfortunately media did not pursue champions of laws from within silent majority and give them airtime in equal measure mobilization of stake holders in this case farmers in cities towns across india albeit on weekends would have forced protesters politicians opposed these laws ratchet down their rhetoric and forced media present counter narrative
then what meaning of having democracy if dont debate on such crucial bills 1991 india was way different from today remember private corporates can not handle bumper production of indian farmers so in end farmers have sell at meagre price
this not acceptable removal of indian flag at any cost either farmer or police this responsibility of both sides protect and respect at least indian flag
rather than taking view of foriegn media let check local media point of view towards iam also belong farmer family iam not oppose farmer but so called indians opposition party want grab advantage counter government laws were demanded previously but now government change
mohdi telling that this international border this side hindustan that side khalistan what confusion congratulations on your independence khalistan zindabad

master stroke wah this godi media has no other work well paid by bjp
only ndtv i showing everything does not matter negative or positive shows everything unlike modi success who only show things which good for bjp
wil arnab trend modi with khalistanis or will say masterstroke
12 another communist party leader also supporting these rowdy farmers in communist country farmers do not own farmland read about how mao zedong lenin stalin simply nationalised every private property do communist party leaders in india own houses strange
and i do not think farmers have swollowed whole repealing at all hindi

proud be punjabi love atomesphere amazing vibes kissan majdoor ekta zindabad
indian agriculture sector needs reforms since old laws failing help farmers in current times as evident from charts described in your documentary currently state has monopoly over purchasing farmers produce leading rampant corruption in system deteriorating farmers condition even more farmers can not sell their produce outside designated mandis denying them freedom trade while 21st century all about market driven economy farmers in india still grappling with archaic license raj system which must go now
and they say bills in favor of farmers
ms shirin ji when modi and other political parties conducted election rallies roadshows during west bengal assembly elections no one followed covid 19 norms like no mask no social distancing right did your news channel opposed pointed out violations done by political rallies roadshows how much truth your channel showing general public
i am educated son of farmer and i like modiji no one pm like this person
sir why cannot government implement these laws in all states except punjab and haryana
i want these farm bills i am also farmer son i used be member of kisan sangh 1 and half years ago but people call me traitor i think people need be sensible and understand that these farm bills what we farmers need
if everyone had united and protested years ago against government including students aged farmers and all we would not have seen this day
first media person should ask annaji about those 3 farm bills and confirm unbiasness whether aware or not
given plight of our farmers please try buy directly from these farmers if when possible most of have extended families living in villages and would be helpful if we buy something from farmers from these very villages
we can see difference how tamil nadu farmers peacefully protected in delhi for 3 months vs punjab business goons leading violently
we proud of modiji and we very sad that some people could not understand modiji
modijis considering about farm laws due gandhi neherus successful democracy development
these protests were and will continue be covid super spreader event way before elections and kumbh farmers started protests flouting covid norms and covid appropriate behavior
i think govt will never back out in buying crops at msp as already increased list of food items under msp and only handful in india context about 7 farmers sell their produce at msp time also come increase some private investment in agriculture and cold storage as we see in states like up bihar many farmers leaving agriculture and doing meagre work in cities since agriculture in no more sustainable for them my only concern rather than making one india one rule central govt should allow state govts make rules for agriculture in their particular states as states know better of their people need they will implement this law at right time when their people ready
earlier even i thought that modi govt weak govt whom anyone can blackmail after i saw that took no action in bengal and maharashtra and obviously this tikaits farzi andolan but i was wrong modi does things very strategically reaches core and when has all cards ready strikes and choke neck from all sides leaving no escape routes for wrong people
u need understand taliban in not modi they do what they say
there some pros and cons in that new farm bills but in india 75 marginal framers so in this way cons more
three farm laws will come statetwise after elections
farmers do not know how produce effective
without farmers no food on our tables

remember how jio internet was free for 1 year when got hooked was rs 199 and now rs 350 zor jhatka dheere lage same will happen farmers
clear bjp had noting more loose electorally if did not recall farm laws or gain if recalled farm laws so then what was other strong reason which meant sacrificing modi strongman image was justified perhaps war with china or pak in offing
just went through comment section below and observed that majority of people very obsessed about bjp and rss though in this entire incident no connection of rss has been visualized not even any media house established any connection between this incident and rss yet but seems they seriously prone misconceptions and consequently making premature attempt amalgamate sacared organization with this tragic incident such organizations mostly indulge into selfless services and always galling see when people blame victim be ruthless this should not be done
i support farm bills i support free market capitalism
congress has have heavy price for this created nuisance
pm has regrettably given into andolan jeevis and regrettable egg on his face now what ever political expediency derived out of will be small gain compared emboldening break india forces and their agents with their workable tactics losers poor farmers and credibly of government if they wanted relent could have left with states up or not
i hope farm laws stand and do not fail i wonder if civil rights movement or even india freedom had been fought when social media was around would we be living same lives we need step up our game against information warfare

so called farmers leaders should be arrested and put up in port blair jail
rakesh takait and yoginder yadav behaving like kapil sharma comedy show even at this time and behaving like whom
only farmers can unite again irrespective of religion
what i have say that agricultural sector in india clearly needs reforms agriculture sector badly needs high end technologies digital tools entrepreneurs and farmer organisations provide services farmers but framework reform should also provide adequate safeguards farming community and clear out their doubts and fears they should not be left linger in concerns about enactments necessary changes can also be made upon consultation and hearing their views because they ones without any bad influence of dirty politicians
omg these r farmers
sir cannot we fix that what buy from farmers can sell just 5 more apmc then 3 more retailers and retailers can sell at 5 more by this common man and consumer will be benefitted
modi government has been wise in cutting their losses and retreat omg completely unnecessary caa crap that modi threw on this nation ended with delhi burning what was very wise about that retreat print has lost its mind because of repeal of farm laws
flag for which gandhiji has three bullets in his chest lala lajpath rai has several lathiyas and many more such leaders and this ashamed farmers this national flag identity in just one second

regarding msp u better ask farmer rice even produced frm single land will not be of same quality so if there hundred kg seventy will get good price and for remaining price will be lower some times at time of harvesting rain may come or lot of problems which can affect quality and price more than that since india member of wto corporates have choice buy low cost food crops frm other countries and central govt spending billions of rupees every year in agriculture sector through various subsidies and schemes and in newspapers we can check prices of crops daily pls check
after kisaan aandolan i started hating this pm modi bcoz i also belongs farmer family so i can feel pain of farmers and i also know strength unity and strong determination of farmers face any struggle in life
thank for supporting and highlighting this protest vox great appreciation from india as indian media has got completely corrupt n unwilling show reality

jai jawan jai kisan only they can go thru such harsh conditions and we cant even appreciate their struggles shame on those who not supporting kisans
why police start rude behave first punjab kisans not spoons of gandhj ji they sons of guru gobind singh ji they know how create path
i do not understand from where these farmers getting time and money continue protest farmers all around country busy in harvesting kharif crops september october how come these farmers have time protest
tomatoes rate getting farmers rs 9 in tamil nadu but in kerala price rs 110 mediators vyabharis looting farmers and tikait helping looters instead of farmers
this modi govt do not care two hoots about any farmer issues
farmers have be treated good without them there will be food crisis and many more issues this unacceptable shameless politicians
when msp secured crop insurance there farmers can think of running bills for three years see working and benefits when potato onion and tomato were selling at or above rs 60 no farmers got benefits when farmers seeing changes getting incentives getting timely payments getting loan waivers after having suffered for 70 years farmers must try bills as option for at least three years

our government really great they listen and do what farmers want them do really appreciate my government work no matter that farmers were wrong or may be right
as per w t rules indian government definitely removed msp that condition farmers knew so farmers do not trust farm laws
anchor and her language seems be modified of direction and production not tv directors and producers directors who now days fund media
because they care of their people they make policies make their citizens strong financially medically their people living quality life their youth has bright future not like tweeting for ssc and railway exams i do not know why our countrymen become blind devotee of govt i mean will they ever dare question this govt why farmers protesting for almost calendar year same farmers who grow foods for why our people shameless selfish arrogant amazes that this current govt every policies goes against welfare of citizens god help those who helps themself anyway do not think that safe but one day will come on roads for any reasons for sure
really impressed by resolve of sikhs and farmers salute them
modi follows trump so just common thing why do not they action do some favor farmers uneducated leader
i have always supported farmers protest despite loving farm bill i thought if farmers didnt like there must be some wrong with law but this not protest its pure hatred
farmers not agreeing for msp cofirmation which govt agreed
same on delhi police why they fire even our 2 kisans die and more than 20 farmers were injured seriously
2 government need formulate law create framework which ensures that farmer should be funded with promised amount as per contract
they farmers not terrorist
salute honest generous farmers of india kudos them
looking at punjab elections shame
here we can witness fact that members of rulling party always node their heads every right and every wrong when bills passed they all agreed now when bills repealed all of them agreed repeal without any objections

farmers suicide high among farmers those produces crops that not covered by msp this facts good enough understand why india failed its farmers in south india bill essentially said that now onwards state will have sole responsibility protect their farmers with parallel system of procurement of crops when market price falls down states such as west bengal doing for quite some time and by passing fci procurement systems supply food other states such tamil nadu or kerala food deficient states will have have forward trade agreement with food surplus states in order establish new equilibrium in crops supply in other words central government has minimised its responsibility for procurement and redistribution of food in india
please support farmers
subsidy which given farmers in form of msp can be diverted in form of subsidy on cheaper electricity seed fertilizers etc does not make sense when subsidy given directly beneficiary then being diverted through middle man
now govt trying break farmers and ultimately this govt will force entire nation slavery be at mercy of modi democracy will go dust bin
traders when have buy will buy from plaes where its available at cheaper prices be ti from other countries and our farmers will suffer when traders dont buy from them think of chines products that have infested indian stores in all sextors bcause of congress free trade policy by great mms when was fm in 1991
indian farmers zindabad very very sad watch this andolan our own farmers treated like foreigners very touching
speaking truth we farmers will support for lifetime
indian farmers have been holding peaceful protests for months now all across country against farm laws and had planned tractor rally across various routes on republic day as agreed with delhi police but on day many rogue farmers faulted plan and attacked red fort where republic day parades happen place of high security many farmer leaders disavowed these groups and stayed on with peaceful protests cooperating with police nevertheless months of efforts have been demeaned by actions of few
when guy hosted nishan saheb there i literally told my mom sb government favor me chla gya 60 din barbaad gye because of obvious reason media
worth noting that farmers freedom was never curtailed legally in state level apmcs act reason why apmc statutes were brought in decades ago continues remain in terms of exploitation of farmers in their market interfaces and nothing much has changed on that front for small and marginal land holders of country reality thatonly 36 of farmers produce gets traded in regulated markets there were however restrictions on traders and buyers operating outside mandis while other trade needs be decriminalised that cannot be understood be regulation
bjp chor modi chor sharm
why not protesting against them in ur country better demand for laws that exists in india
my salute farmers let election come we teach lesson bjp
we should not see only one aspect of any situation which our media social media tells jai jawaan jai kisaan
after up election modi g be like was prank guy there was camera
agriculture should become non profit cooperative business model by assuring basic income for all farmers and having control of land through cooperative setup this will eliminate corporates who want become rich and who dont want be regulated india poor country we should have regulation in everything and all industries should become non profit cooperative business enterprise model like amul and aavin cooperativesocialism way go
do even know what khalistan every thing has limit they were staying at borders for 52 days peacefully moreover if they wanted khalistan they would have unrooted tricolor flag and waved kisan flag dont be blind and biased

just if some one blocking capital high ways for weeeks that serious issue for govt too was there discussions with govt how many rounds does govt come down satisfy farmers there were committees setup but no conclusion
good move because khalistani and anti indian elements were trying make inroad in shield of farm laws
same thing will happen in open market also farmers will become price takers only

god be with all and with our hon ble farmers
ordered like general dyer no one should escape live all who feel right would need smash their head against wall feel atleast small pain what farmers had suffered
we getting potatoes today at rs 40 per kg and how much does farmers get will be surprised
left ideology dangerous for our future generations india did not develop because most of ngos and human rights activists of left ideology their history of violence they think rich people like tata reliance adani exploiting poor and their resources what congress did their news anchors did not report for 70 years for positions and black money secularism their agenda because they know dominate hindus they have divide them by caste reservations religion law removing their true history hiding facts from public every religion has religious place churches in goa jama masjid in delhi and golden temple for sikhs but no ram temple for 80 population for 70 years because of whom all religions came birth in india so hindus feels cheated for so many years and these gunda party congress who wanted promote vulgarity through bollywood divide people all congress advisors were left naxal ideology people who support china against india that why most of trade we imported from china even what happened at golden temple was because advisors of indra gandhi were left ideology people from india who support communist party of china they in press jnu offices students that why they stand with anti india forces in name of human rights and also stop development work so people of india remain poor and slowly revolt against govt this game going on in north east naxal affected areas for so long they use twitter what app groups mobilize crowds by spreading rumours and in security in public time has come expose these anti national forces india
farmers backbone of country
in india if anyone haveing education they r not willing do farming they want go outside do job thts harse reality as well
current mandi system also has huge issues we worrying about farmers situations but do not want change old laws how can that be
because of election modi
being from farmers background and currently practicing lawyer i can definitely say that these farm bills have power revolutionize entire farming industry will definitely be helpful in advancing farming industry we should have open mindset towards these bills
i will always support farmers
i do not agree with abhijeet that this withdrawal do anything with elections in punjab where bjp never had hold or uttar pradesh or any other state that your assumptions so do not fall in trap always your mind open for all plausible scenarios
such shame because of few farmers whole farmer community in india have lost their respect
govt should listen farmers

after one year agitation as govt doing nothing people doing what bjp govt should get carry on till modi resigns
okay so now fear of elections arrive and i am proud of farmers who stayed and protested for more than year and my sympathy all martyrs who fought for their rights
giving freedom for farmers and middle man profit removing also protesting people not vote for bjp anycost so there not worrying be honest farmers bills good
i think these 3 bills not good for farmers government just want leave their duties support poor farmers and these bills mostly support private companies indian farmers not as strong as private companies and they cannot fight for their rights from these companies govt duties help and facilitate poor farmers and in india mostly farmers small farmers
all politicians talk and talk and only talk of helping farmers only get votes but poor farmers got nothing because system was such only benefitted middlemen but modiji did not only talk but brought law really help farmers where they can now sell anywhere and anybody now middlemen do not have monopoly of buying farm products jai modiji jai hind jai bharat if agree with modiji new act supporting farmers please hit

u can see that farmers in were protesting for last 350 days and bjp not only keeping quiet but going against them in court of law by its affidavits supporting ruling ysrcp teach lesson for its alliance partner walking out from nda
modi ji doing good if these protestors had faith on useless congress for 70 years then why can t they have faith on modi ji my question why majority of farmer unions from different parts of country have agreed not they farmers before blaming any one be change that u want see around u jai shree ram vande mataram
your entire analysis on assumption that average farmer well informed organised and has strength deal with powerful capitalists living in imaginary world
gift increase petrol prices by 25 and bring down by 5 bring some laws which patently wrong and roll them back at best can be as correcting mistake no gift but huge cost farmers 750 lost their lives 1000s injured or in jails on fake cases untold economic misery
i respect your research but wd this opposition who always batted for these laws and when modi govt tabled they all took u turn would ready for discussion in parliament hell no these laws good for farmers as u said thats modi govt passed wd ordinance if would b discussed sure this would 10 years

ignorant ignorance and hysteria without any implementation and how would any consequence can be anticipated this just mass hysteria and passions that we indians associated perpetually girl speaks what has been fed very short information and very limited knowledge read farm bills line by line omit and deliberate loopholes this uncalled for

demand yadav making that penal provisions be included that if anybody buys farm produce below msp will be put trial and punishment in case done sure that produces will rotten if there oversupply in market example of wheat if oversupply there for wheat which can be easily produced excess produce will not be purchased by anybody due fear of legal provisions so demand for penal provisions utter foolishness will put especially small and medium farmers into more trouble
i used earlier appreciate vast range of knowledge that abhijit has but of late kind of comments makes downright nonsense and without backing with any proof or data discussion on 3 farm laws withdrawal case i want mention very clear that modiji has this decision with totally different situation in mind as against political reasons and without analysing this abhijit compares modiji with rahul saying another rahul in govt this utter nonsense which will be proven very soon
rajesh tikaith doesn t have that much guts join party and fight against bjp

its been 3 months government just ignoring so i think patience level of farmers might be over modi government responsible for this kind of riots i think government should listen farmers and their needs part of our democracy we independent we dont want any kind of dectatorship in india
link aadhaar card with voter id card next election cannot vote bjp new rule

supportfarmers modi horrible leadership
sir please tell truth of 26 january farmers need your support
modi ji doing great job for country
i think all labour unions must also come in support of farmers in total country
farmers will never forgive modi for centuries for what did them in last one year
contract between farmer and private company will be there in presence of mandi
bjp aur rss seigh whole nation nation media country in name of various jumala like vikash hindutva ram mandir ram rajya good governance aachay din not only this 2 carore jobs per years and 15 lackh for kaal dhan

farm laws were thrust upon parliament and farmers both such laws never work and such processes of law making never in national interest
like india always comparing itself with pakistan and showing that we growing faster than pakistan irrespective of other countries growing faster than similarly bjp always showing we doing better as compared upa irrespective of amount of production
sir apmc was abolished in bihar in 2006 has situation of farmers improved
farmers tight slap police

last time farmers had did something for police force and now return
this best informative video made by anyone on farm bill great work
issues 1 farmers might not get adequate demand for their produce at msp in local mandi 2 they do not have resources transport produce over large distances 3 distress sale of products at lower price at local mandi farmers
i am with farmers but whatever happened today was shameful those who behind this incident should be punished
i was so baffled that none of news channels on tv talked about how repeal of laws might be for his own benefit if this had been done by any other person they would have literally invaded their homes ask these questions and most importantly i have seen multiple protests in my lifetime and never have i ever seen media so blatantly against one god knkws where this going
this media still protecting modi ji
do not sell your land indian government or other people your god given gift be farmers
3 if any dispute between farmer and industry then farmer cannot go court only can go sdm court not this point breaking our fundamental rights because as per constitution there independent judiciary system in india for citizen
so that pakistan supporting jihadi opposition leader
repealing does not actually help farmer only helps middleman big setback for india towards progress
farm laws not liked by only panjab and up farmers and there were no agitations in other parts of india except these two states i am from maharashtra and i know here how farmers getting benitfits of these laws
thanks 4 helping d farmers
according prs legislative research percentage of bills referred parliamentary committees has fallen from 60 and 71 in 14th lok sabha 200409 and 15th lok sabha 200914 27 in 16th lok sabha 201419 and even lower 12 in current lok sabha since 2019 many important bills including three farm laws that were repealed recently did not get discussed in parliamentary committees
we with modiji whatever
1 apmc exploit farmers which usually run by powerful middlemen example farmers in maharashtra in 2019 got rs 8 kg for onions whereas sp was rs 99 kg or how farmers only got rs 2 kg for onions in 2018 in and so many countless stories farmers who have contract with mcd for potatoes in india doing much better
farmers should get msp law passed dis right time modi will listen before election not after election
no farmer no food
being farmer i know that most of farmers do not have store houses so that they can store their agriculture produce and wait for good price of their agriculture produce in free market they have sell their crop even if price drastically low otherwise bad weather can destroy their 6 month hard work and lot of investment
committee members not farmers they economists scientists etc who support tycoons entering agriculture market with money and technology now farmers depending on fertiliser pesticides when modern technology comes agriculturists will have depend for genetically modified seeds also they have buy at price fixed by these companies modern machinaries will come which small farmer cannot afford they have sell their lands and become menial workers in city losing their divinity and we consumers have eat all dangerous grains which will affect our health thecpharma companies hospitals and stick market will be happy
i support farming these pictures cnt give judgement whole protest 2crore zuyada kisan ko bura nhi
congratulations farmers
this shows weakness of modi first of all there was no need for such laws all govt had do was remove any restriction farmers might have in selling their products no new laws were needed middlemen who controls trade aided by khalistanis abroad used defame modi and test his will they succeeded now they will try bring him new lows and they might succeed in that also
i would also question premise that amendment farming produce trade and commerce bill will result in minimal benefit small farmer who anyways sells outside of ampc already and does not have means sell different states this fairly conservative view based on current state of technology and business models this can change immensely with changes technology and if private players get into distribution and e commerce style of operations of agricultural products good number of low income small farmers do have access internet and mobiles already
will dk dmk admk congress and communists now responsibility for disgrace of today india and appropriate action
nope india needs move move away from controlled economy supply and demand economy farmers suffer everywhere due climate uncertainty economic growth and government policies so they need become market aware and produce goods people want buy at quality and price they can afford they need tiger by tail and control
farmers as very intelligent when comes their interests and voting time will prove again states where these these laws get implemented will flourish
now understand was not about farmers was about election
govt bills policy and sarkari yojna prokolpo guli niye video upload korle valo hoy i hope i shall get see expected videos bro thanks
failure here of government much more so than farmers
i think this law will be give benifit for farmer and whole india agriculture system will boost
great journalism sir have also won with our dear farmers
modi ji drama up election chale ga agar kisan chahta 3 din me kanun bapas if farmers stop food chain supply this film making by congress till up election
in his book we people nani palakhiwala has mentioned that in india economical power lies in cities and political power in villages whole episode of farm laws has proved that was absolutely right
apmc can be used as benchmark for setting msp as minimum procurement price for commodities
respect harp farmer
this was bad decision repeal imo because provided more freedom and opportunity farmers but i hope in future government has some better plans for them and has better communication skills whilst introducing bill
good job modiji do your work in other fields
great analysis on farmers protest salute your courage
one of most unbiased video i watched on farm bill
edited after watching this video i did not get why farmers protesting
2 months farmers doing strike in such cold weathe amodi devil doesnt have good heart solve farmers issues but only after adani for his godowns cheaply bought items from farmers
congratulations farmers solidarity against modi and bjp next freedom for kashmir and khalistan
if second scenario case than will send false message about actual market because good prices farmers means good demand in market which will inturn attract more people do farming and than government have spend even more procure these products and because of demand and supply disbalance procured product will just rot in storage bins i e rotting of our tax money
this not only farmer protest its bloody politics
farmers for time being cultivate for and your family only
just oppose narendra modi india lost important agriculture reform all economic farm like imf also said these laws important
darandar muddy supressing farmers becouse majority sikh brothers
just one thing mention here as said there should be one intermediary between company farmers what chances that intermediary will not treat farmers as traders doing
some economists say that only 6 of farmers benefit from msp what they hide fact that these 6 farmers produce 90 of foodgrains this figure that dates back 2013 situation today very different and more realistic recent data that about 35 farmers have started using msp facility in any case these figures have many caveats and errors one can digging and soon begin see maze of questions and puzzles but question how these figures of 6 or 35 justify into decision of scrapping msp
my goodness such huge mammoth respect farmers
very strange why reporter asking questions with farmers why they do not ask questions with government or ministers bjp why only opposite party farmer
many people in my family farmers but they not out there protesting they in fields farming and these bastards who call themselves farmers not they same farmers who did same with policemen at red fort they deserve this
indeed sad that kisan did not come for discussion when govt called opposition too ditched nation for their own benefits so unfortunate that decision repeal farmers bill was decided on road and not in parliament this what call democracy then why elections let discuss on roads just imagine what will happen this nation if everyone sits on road block each other progress this was totally unconstitutional and undemocratic
i want tell that no big media showed that farmers were sitting there for more than two months peacefully
uncle ji tussi sikh isliye being respect bt sorry do not stand for d rights of ppl which right bjp giving ppl frm 6yrs n stil u r with thm aur farmers lathi charge b bolre will sit discuss hum hongay cz lathi aapko paddi aur seat pyaari sikhs naam kharab karre uncle sikhi definitely sikhati
your research absolutely correct as son of farmer i totally agree with because i witnessed apmc
farmers or middleman these mofos middleman who earns million just by doing nothing
let them have voice in process let farmers have real influence
feel so sorry for death of farmers and police men its unfortunate situation i wish politicians should maintain dignity by fighting for cause rather than making visits cash on emotions of poor farmers
with all that fuss even we were not able sell gvt those third party guys demanded bit less prices as they would gain in between farmer and government and moreover they have not bought even let alone this farmer bill find solution no solution be laws without laws
farmers i thought they were khalisthane
election isiliye bill
msp given only on wheat and paddy because government buys while other crops bought by private buyers at even less than half of msp government should try and focus on that so farmers move from one crop other
five sardars massacred by uncivilized terrorists in kashmir let italian congress team visit their families and protest against killers and pakistan if at all they have any concern for country
rakesh ji my brother farmer community get together united again now students also need leader like fight for their rights
talked about msp let me tell scenario of sale of maize this season msp of maize 1850rs per quintal so farmers should be able sell their produce at 1850rs but no they were not able do so and sold at around 800 1000rs per quintal because no one buys at msp
one should look upon timing wah modiji wah
i am really worried for my farmer brothers there they have created war zone around border media also not allowed in there they have stopped internet too do not know what government planning god help them
we stand with farmers
2 during election campaign bjp says that will provide free vaccine bihar people

i feel that this agriculture reformed bill proposed by gov needs some changes amendments ensure that our most diligent hardworking farmer brothers get their truly deserving rewards
1 i wish can talk about limitation that 1st law imposing on farmer if there dispute on contract farmers cant go court dispute
wt about bihar election i support kisan heros
must be happy that what guys called for and wanted shame on people who were supporting these terrorists police must open fire on them and al terrorist symphatisors should be behind bars forever
good law bad deployment sad shows slamming laws down someones throat doesnt make real consensus building through democratic means involving all relevant stake holders while can be slow and painful right strategy for india people clamoring for muscling up strategy on any issue over consensus building approach should know india too fragmented and diverse in its view points be strong armed into one this would have been best time for bjp use its cadre do drives related benefits of these laws rather than employing rhetoric nevertheless last part of what pm said gives me hope all party committe while could set back by sometime should atleast get some part of these laws back if not all nay sayers of these laws i want say one thing market economics only reason why this country has developed in last 30 years move against that would mean agriculture would continue slip as percentage of gdp we dont want be food importing nation again lets be together and do what takes revive this sector
do not talk rubbish about sant jarnail singh bhindranwale never demands khalistan do your research zee news

unprecedented support ajit anjum ji from beginning vapsi with fateh great movement victory with determination proud of our farmers
today we lost another information war corrupt people succeeded in manipulating farmers for their own benefit
modi ji swore on being truthful when said repealing farm laws for national interest by national interest obviously means national security now if really was being truthful then will be consistent with national security reason will not national security threat emanated or originated or was focused or was spreading from protests therefore first sign of threat disappearing has be complete call off of protests has not now if protestors do not call off and continue protest making other demands before calling off will mean that national security threat will not disappear at that moment modi ji has come back announce that since objective of repealing laws was not met i do not feel laws should be repealed and i reverse decision repeal we will proceed as per sc committee report and further hearing
only sikh farmers being shown everywhere
solidarity with farmers great jesture of support by people
modi god of india
if msp increased for crops other than rice and wheat subsequently year by year along with awareness campaigns among producers then i think farmers might adopt mixed farming
talibans surly supported for weapons and financially by some countries may be china usa and some muslim countries
union home minister cannot talk farmers but can fly hyderabad for election campaign shame they not committed help poor they committed beef up there pockets

another problem if all farmers start growing only one crop that has highest msp then when will happen fci because most mos farmer going single corp then water consumption more
government should have given punjab implement their own state assembly resolution as agriculture state subject besides agitation was restricted punjab only and so ther states should have free choice specially could be implemented in bjp ruled states establish its benefit at very start shortsighted govt should not have rushed with act without properly assessing ground situation its political blunder
god bless farmer in india
these were not farmers but brokers and mislead uneducated farmers who were told that their land would be grabbed by govt or private companies later so protest

i think that these protests largely fuelled by politically connected strong middlemen they benefit from extant status quo by controlling all aspects of farm business cycle and consequently lives of farmers farmers have been disempowered at hands of lowly middlemen urea manufactureres etc high time we care about farmer business model and not flood him with nonsensical subsidies
rakesh tikat living legend
we with carry forward your work help congress win elections
underlying problem that presenter highlighted in most of drawbacks apprehension that govt would abandon and cease exist as player hence leading exploitation by private entities but government has assured that would not cease exist as player and included strong provisions protect farmer in various situations further if market forces resort such behavior govt has tools and capabilities further enact laws protect farmers interests but based on this apprehension alone fair disallow private players who could reduce inefficiencies in system and portrayed successful co operative movements like amul and others plus we have examples where govt continues exist as player alongwith private entities airlines power oil telecom banks etc
farming prevalent in other states of india also but why only punjab farmers present at protest predominantly and all people present actually farmers there huge political agenda behind protests do not be fooled by mainstream media be smart read actual documents read data analyse and then draw conclusions
this decision of modiji was shocking but we have compulsion of modi till no other hindu leader comes forward really too sad and bad decision

would like see all cut clutter videos regarding particular topic in one list guess its 4th ctc video abt farm bills
after taking anti government stances perhaps have forgotten that capitalists backbone of any great economy and india had great chance transform agricultural economy but punjabi farmers did not wanted that cuz they still want go canada and uk by selling their farm land but farmers from other states should have understood especially up farmers that people of up son of soil and they will never flaunt like punjabi farmers who go canada or uk as illegal immigrants
yogi should win but modi should lose been saying this since 2019 elections
in vancouver theres indians protesting in streets huge parades its dope cant drive without seeing support farmers sign and orange flags
police should listen bombay bandook and let farmers protest in peace
but i have question in my mind question that how poor farmer can stay away from his her for so long time of more than 1 and half years i ma not supporter of modi and as of i think there only about 2500 5000 farmers there in protest from past few months and not possible pay such small group of farmers i am saying this because in my district in election of jila panchayat sadasya competitors had paid poor peoples go with him in election campaign and if such person who have very less money as compared national parties or who want repeal these farm laws

print becoming one of most genuine source of news in this right and left leaning digital and tv media space watching today media feels like either they of extreme right view or extreme left view feels good have media network whose news based on solid research and facts and that talks sense rather than being mouthpiece of either ideology this type of journalism that india needs we hope with passing days print becomes bigger and stronger
correction modi ji kisan nhi pure desh even pappu ko v malum
mr dhruv can explain viewers on why these so called farmer leaders choose abandon these three farm laws completely initially govt said talk on these attributes and agreed do all such changes in law in favor of farmer this rational approach just kid and talks with half true facts which i believe as good as lying your viewers

even in theory free market in agriculture will be disaster because markets never free free market fairly tale markets either oligopoly or increasingly in case of india monopoly so say that in theory these laws good laughable just check condition of small farmers
real reason that bjp mlas in at least 100 constituencies in up 117 in punjab and 70 in hp may not able come out and do electioneering in forth coming elections in early 2022 arrogant leadership left speechless and failed call on 500 bjp karyakartas victim families during in wb and kerala recently concluded elections but found time speak film star about leg injury

whats wrong with indian media
money saves rich poor farmers even judiciary didnt care about them
i know police have follow ministers orders bt they all should feel ashamed before stopping or attacking farmers
i cannot claim understand these laws and i usually trust gupta ji declutter such stuff i am more inclined than ever invest in modi because actually was bold enough want reform and opposition inc and actually hindered progress just because if they were all really interested in welfare of farmers and country they would have aided passing these reforms really sad state of country when mob holds progress hostage
farmers agitation only troubling poor public and govt appears be least bothered
sir best wishes those all farmers and those media channel who stand in front of this government and stand with correct things thank

i agree ministers and mechanism of govt totally failed make people understand that why they bringing laws and how will help farmers and also failure of media houses who were busy making trp they promotes that protest more key question good for farmers
disbandment of apmcs has not worked well in bihar farmer who owns 4 acres of land in bihar acts as labourer in panjab because growing any kind of crop on his land in bihar so disastrous india socialist democracy and merely copying and pasting policies from capitalist countries not applicable here in west single farmer will have land holdings of thousands of acres and only having subsidies makes farming profitable for them farmer struggling there as well if farmer was making 70 cents on dollar before corporates got in now makes about 14 cents rest goes into pocket of corporate its not possible replicate that model on farm holdings of 2 acres or so

group of chad farmers or virgin indian government
all these years farmers in maharashtra were doing suicide because of these farm laws now they will all live in luxury thanks their support punjab farmers
what they were trying do was pass bill without any voting with help of voice votes by bjp members opposition on saying that please consider voting but speaker didnt listen very manner in which bill was passed was wrong unconstitutional and against procedures of rajya sabha but what opposition did also bit questionable as there violence was not required in fact violence bill rukta fayeda bill pass hee gussa nikalne bill ruka isliye in my opinion violence mic toddna fayeda its not solution in fact they should go court and challenge this bill on how was passed that would be right way and they should protest and do dharnas thats right way not violence haasil
bjp must be taught lesson farmers will do that
devote be like farmer anti nationalist

3 agriculture census 2015 16 published in 2019 revealed that average size of land holdings in respective states of punjab and haryana higher than average size of national holdings and much higher than that of state of up bihar odisha wb mp chattisgarh and other states who have greater dependency of population on agriculture sector for their subsistence therefore creates condition which coupled with assistance during green revolution and resulting infrastructure and ecosystem favours punjab farmers more farmers of other agricultural states in terms of production capacity volume automation supply on large scale and etc

i live in haryana and daughter of farmer
interesting how government intervention created problem yet indian farmers rather operate under centralized governance rather than free market society although many jobs would be potentially lost in process would also benefit economy as whole history has shown that competition can lead increases in efficiency and can help solve problems that could not have been countered without such competition even if farmers were entirely replaced which would be indication of consumer favouritism job opportunities would still be created and might favour those with education or who wish increase quality of their lives this process which has occurred historically in many countries that evolved from farming industrialization almost necessary sacrifice if societies wish evolve and should not always be resisted
thanks sir for raising farmers voice

now this seems me as gorilla tactics of afghanistan government forces on taliban ofcourse with aid of air strikes earlier afghanistan government had maintain long supply lines and taliban chooses strike wherever wants and now afghan government turn strike wherever wants and cause damage and loss taliban gorilla sword sharp from either side takes efforts run government and only strike disrupt similar tactics being played even in politics in india takes efforts run country smoothly and all takes protest bring country halt so anybody who stops country for petty protests should be penalized for loss of production including taxes and should also be jailed for quite sometime

true example indian farmers not only did achieve this for which i am so happy for but have shown rest of world things not hopeless give me strength
mandimers tour delhi if farmers rich like these india may be no 1 in world media hiding many realities due vested interests and not thinking actual farmers of country
alot of people not thinking outside box with private players entering market farmers will have more employment opportunities not bearing risks involved with damaged crops also fact that private enterprises statistically more productive compared government enterprises in india this invariably means that there will be greater level of focus towards achieving high standard of productivity also private enterprises would have ability raise capital and make investments implement better farming technologies in india although private entities will be entering market government will still impose logical and reasonable regulations like how rbi regulates large proportions on private banking functions in india also important know that mandi culture currently mafia driven culture where middlemen and government officials in on and if this bill comes into place would be hard for them make their cuts illegally so this just my opinion after doing bit or research although on face value we do not see this because no one covers positive angle this story
modiji indian government wah ji rajniti bich me log fas or mr very good

rakesh tikait has given appropriate replies ajit anjum twisted questions with wit and cleverness of farmer leader famous for
took control from states and made 1 act for whole country centre govt will issue guidelines related state and no role in except adherence guidelines mode and manner in which payment shall be given farmers
fact that we live in such politically polarized times very few actually get or want read objectively understand reality of any new legislation i am not surprised by usual stupidity of my punjabi brethren in protesting such reforms who willingly or unwillingly allowing themselves be misled by hypocritical lier leaders with vested interests actually reminds one of fake narrative peddling being done create controversies out of thin air as was done against caa central govt has actually lost initiative in this battle of narratives they now struggling get actual truth out in public domain

do note indian flag was flying much higher behind two kissan and sikh flags that were put up on that pole i doubt farmers really have any desecration of nation on their mind as most of them were waving indian flags proudly at red fort alongside kissani and sikh flags this case of agitation which has slowly built up and up over course of many months
thanks bro for true reporting thanks for helping farmers

country no farmers no food
police dis good job they not farmers whole world knows
sg talk about required changes and shift from wheat and paddy production which agreeable but these 3 bills that have been passed do not seem problematic from top but when get details contain serious issues when big corps come into play they can easily create artificial demand or vice verca reduce price and with no msp in place farmers can be easily exploited plus gov also put in rule that states farmers can not go court if any problems with contract or with company only one gov officer for every district will oversee protests reasonable sg pointed out obivious changes that needed and they will be implemented but some details of these laws going cause severe misery farmers decrease in growth rate gdp of punjab mostly related rooted corruption of government most of caused by akali dal and bjp coalition that was in punjab from past 2 decades
thum logo headlines hamesa varkaw rhata that all farmers ok and indian logo chah ok

made assumption that farmers getting fair price from middlemen any data back up
i respect both of but like all analysis this one also lacks ground reality yes know facts but do not know mood and distress in rural areas modi ministers and bjp party has done more harm than farm laws by calling these people names rural areas in these states were core bjp supporters and its allies we were telling from beginning that this fight with its own people completely unnecessary and that too over these farm bills now can argue about their benefits but again on ground concerns were real and rss factor i know our local rss people and their uncomfort in saving gov face over their actions in past daali baite ko kaat

down controversial farm laws problem solved i completely blame govt for this make laws for farmer farmer did not like then why still force law
thank for your video furthermore these 3 bills of law will simply remove 1 1 relationship farmers have with their buyers create mass unemployment in already poor rural areas and furthermore leave farmers mercy person big corporations these new laws remove courts federal state and larger governments legal capacity support farmers during contract disputes and moves this in hands of bureaucratic officers so we should ask corruption still issue in india current mandi and arhtiyas system provides number of other key services farmers they provide small low rate loans labour network farmers together and provide assistance farmers when they struggling also worth noting that farmers small businesses and if ask any business owner cash flow heart of any successful business as many unexpected costs can often arise these laws will erode current credit system and no private company will not replace this and why should they if farmers in one bad year at mercy of corporations have no access credit and state intervention or legal recourse they will be forced sell their land respond short term problem when they arise once they sell their land they sell only asset that they may own in fact in every western country well known persons earnings only contribute 25 of their lifetime wealth whereas 75 wealth attributed what they own asset value and land asset that grows in price this has happened repeatedly farmers in times of recession when markets manipulated by inflation and deflation of markets anyhow today farmers in europe have much more advanced mandi and arhtiyas type of system which known as cooperative farming which provide these necessary support services that farmers need bihar farmers have already gone through something similar and lack agriculture credit system crippling their farmers current system its something that india should be proud of and should be expanded throughout hindustan jai hind

what many people dont understand 1 central govt does not have budgetary resources buy entire product of all farmers around india that why they do not want make law otherwise they will be bound buy everything economically and fiscally this impossible 2 apmc mandis strongly cartelised meaning only few people can buy from there becoz getting license very difficult and costs lot 5lacs so these traders buy produce at low prices eventually hurting farmers also small farmers do not have money their produce by tractor mandi pay taxes and storage cost till produce sold by legitimising outside mandi sale this will help them legally sell outside mandi farm laws have been in implementation in rashtra for over decade and now and mandis still intact 3 conflict resolution problem genuine this something that govt should consider 4 repeal of essential commodities act will benefit traders who will now want buy produce sell at higher price without govt intervention even if we imagine that this will lead steep prices will not lead many people beginning trade sell at slightly lower price than competition be at profit this will ultimately ensure correct prices this basically essence of market economics i e promote efficiency through competition and self interest

regarding court settlement of disputes do they want drag these honest poor and innocent farmers web of lengthy expensive cumbersome legal procedures of indian judicial system nowadays taking more time get dispute redressal in reasonable manner must also note that most of sdm young ias recruits who entered system with utmost vigour competence and ardent devotion doing good for society should also note that workload of local judge more than same as sdm of course no system perfect and blemishes free even if farmer allowed option approach court there no guarantee will get suitable redressal because of widespread corruption in indian legal system so i suggest each and every one approach issue in more open and unbiased manner we cannot allow our emotions rule over visible facts figures and realities i know i am not that educated but i always try approach issue in honest way without any prejudices

modiji spineless think twice before speak rubbish analysis by mr mitra modi ji never did anything for votes leaving this midway not worthy
john stewart would have done more research that 250 million figure wack farmers living in one small section of india ruled by opposing party participating in this protest farmers living in most places in india do not even avail these support prices due various reasons and support new farm laws farmers of one particular region have been made fear free market by socialists and some anti national forces current system needs change as 10k farmers kill themselves annually in current system due debt and this privatization and establishing open market seems be only way these protesting farmers will also still be able sell their produce at support prices even after bill passed they have additionally been given option of selling in open market and they protesting based on conspiracy theory that soon these support prives will go away and corporations will destroy them
mistaken farmers have not blocked road they wanted protest in traditional ram leela maidan in delhi prevent them from going protest site police have blocked roads
on other hand one could also argue that bigger companies would first lure farmers in by providing them better than msp pricing slowly enabling shutdown of apmc markets and no msp and once done that they can become like zamindars that india was trying escape in first place due which apmc was set up valid concern i do acknowledge
new farm laws dont anything away from farmers they just give them more option sell their produce protest and everything ok but wouldve better if guys went into details about new laws this protest wont work as its baseless
extremity of bjp government total failure vis vis farmers agitation limitless brutality but cm enjoying his get together

farmers produce trade and commerce promotion and facilitation ordinance 2020 allows intra state and inter state trade of farmers produce beyond physical premises of apmc markets state governments prohibited from levying any market fee cess or levy outside apmc areas

i am rubber plantation owner from family in this business for more than hundred years in our experience whatever economists scientists bureaucrats politicians or journalists say or write about they always get away if their prescriptions wrong because unfortunately there no accountability for all above classes of people all they have do shoot from hip mouth and pen and whether people suffer or benefit of no consequence them there trust deficit between farmers and all other classes i have mentioned above and this issue can be solved by talking with people affected farmers not some idiots living in rural india in fact many of more educated intelligent and hardworking than our urban counterparts but unfortunately all classes of people i mentioned address urban india because that were moolah and many urbanites think that farmers can be easily twisted by some third rate politicians do some real research i wonder when was last time ila patnaik took her head out of her numbers and interacted with farmers find out their real problems because such interactions will also give birth some lasting solutions jai hind bharat mata jai
i hope farmers and people involved will restrain from acting violently as seems that they being provoked retaliate
finally paagal pm bow downs farmers not before killing 500 of them
farmers for freedom
nothing wrong in asking for discussion why laws being repealed what happened because government could not bear see more farmers dying at morcha or some other reason like upcoming elections in some states democracy
one dead farmer killed himself by driving tractor at high speed into barricade and tractor toppling on top of him what your headline seemed miss was numbers of indian police men and women who died as result of protestors actions protesters were protesting against addition of option sell their crops by themselves without middlemen eating into their profits this riot was backed by non else than greta thunberg who was involved in producing and releasing google toolkit outlining incidents on these dates inciting these people do what they did environmental greta backed those who destroy indias environment by stubble burning use pesticides prolifically making that area cancer capital of india and whose indiscriminate use of fertiliser has polluted water table well done greta
pm of india should learn from farmer what ever takes r how long takes common people will not be able bend for more people will shed their blood then listen mr pm

hahaha great video this actually sounds pretty good msp for security and free market for prosperity lot of farm produce get wasted in india this will actually help reduce time sell these perishable goods and reduce hoarding but may also lead large scale industrial farming and totally push poor farmers off equation high time people left all farming automated machines easier said than done though

pm modi has done great job liberalize indian agriculture and paved way introduce industrial capital in agricultural products which in turn help boost rural economy will help extend market on which modern indian independent capitalism will grow will give india great purchase power like china every country will come india sell their goods will extend india tax giving people more than 100 crores when 80 indian peasants start buying things for their choice and requirements industry will grow hundred and hundred folds unemployment problem will solve great great thumps up for very job by bjp and pm modi jee has hurt interest of 5 i and canada one of them they white colonial and extracted labor of black people from africa they enslaved and tortured black african and made money like uk usa australia new zealand they along with their follower who want extract blood of poor peasant of our country red salute bjp who did great job which left could not achieve for their majority left of india should support bill with some constructive suggestions and rectifications
1 everyone knows that we need reforms but change hard and people with vested interest in status quo will not like so helps everyone govt talks stake holders and try them along modi image in india quite positive and people do seem be very forgiving towards him forgiving him after stupidity called demonetisation for example so should use that resolve issues personally if needed for example meeting farm leaders

ok that comment at 3 28 not correct there no mention of withdrawal of government mandis in bill please read bill before making factual statements also note that protests primarily only in single state there no other protests against bill all over india there farmers in every state of country death rate mentioned by report largely from other states not punjab which has fraction of total death rate if bill was so bad this would be all india movement instead of just one state as such bill good but politics bad which what has led this situation
our issue not with what farmers get freebies for our simple demands that physically handicapped punjabis also get free electricity may be only for their work places factories only and physically handicapped indians income also exempted from payment of income tax
that why i am supporting farm laws and against making laws on msp
i think bjp will induct these laws state wise now rather than centrally that better solution if punjab and haryana farmers does not want their betterment leave them alone
legends still thinks these farmers
prasoon jee thanks farmers grow food grain for indian people government business can buy food grain from farmers mandi msp must vote chot no vote for bjp bjp will loose state governments bill bapsi ghar bapsi and msp on 23 fassals in law indian from uk

why does this guy talk so negatively about modiji
may god give strength these farmers continue protest till anti farmer laws repealed back
news channels insulting farmers why says farmers gundas
this farmers bill 2020 forcefully passed by bjp in rajya sabha
bad decision ultimately bjp sacrifices interest of overall farmers for sale of pampered rich farmers who cornered majority map this why india will never grow continuously at higher growth rate like china this shows that too much democracy not in interest of nation two times majority having party abundance important laws for few rich farmers
punjab already has contract farming and ppl r really happy govt has just expanded other states
democracy dus sdm know eats food produced by farmers anndata

wow i love secularism rakesh tikait said one of greatest secularist words
today farmers make history salute our farmers
before farmer can only sell their crop mandi at some fixed price now farmers can sell their crop anyone where they can get good revenue in return along with mandis still being maintained now farmers get chose who sell their crop
almost 90 percent of people from delhi with farmers
stone pelting they joking theres farmers on both side throwing stones would result in cross fire and funny thing if single person throwing rock was actually captured in video this clown media would show over and over and over again slow motion high lighted
second whole world watches and knows that delhi police has blocked roads not farmers although honourable supreme court in delhi still does not know that who has blocked road then honourable supreme court mistakes
modi also asked msp as cm nothing wrong if farmers ask
bbc statement that 3 farm laws were detrimental small farmers complete lie in fact reverse these 3 farm laws were for improving income by small farmers by allowing them sell as cooperative outside regulated farmer market called apmc mandi in india however this would have made large farmers and middlemen in regulated farmer markers lose their political clout and latter were ones protesting on streets especially in punjab and western up states of india
pathetic politicians instigating farmers indulge in violence
jay hind jay bharat i love my india and proud of pm modiji great pm of india
big bazzar owned by reliance now modi govt removed apmc for external buyer such as big bazzar what coincidence

deep sidhu and lakaha sidhana was right becoz when protest was started they both were with farmer no committee was with them but now defamed all them on one basis i am from punjab so i know well becoz i see directly when farmer was on haryana border no committee was their they and their fews friends help cross haranya border so i do not think was wrong plz see pervious news carefully
so some regulation needed along with strengthing infrastructure of markets by increasing their frequency and enabling small and marginal farmers form their own societies or cos so that trade cartels or big corporates cannot exploit them
problem with these so called farmer organizations which reportedly protesting that they headed by zamindars who always up for sale highest bidder infact in states such as punjab haryana only zamindars have wherewithal be elected as representatives be sarpanch or for that matter cm
sir u did not talk about msp leakages how much amount of money middle men elite farmer why only punjab lets see implementation after 2 3 year then compare previous and present situation u r just doing speculation this was same thing before lpg reform everyone was against but now situation completely changed

farmars became looser apmc dalal winer
jawan kisan his my hero i always in support 5sali donggiii ayege aur jayege
punjab elections aarhe
very weird kind of voting system chairperson should be neutral what need of debate after having repealed law why law being repealed that should be discussed before repealing what way india going
farmers should fight for decent pension and universal income too they souls of nation not voters
and why our pm repealed these laws just before elections and no mention of 700 farmers who died protesting
farmers mainstream for future india
they farmer not criminal respect theem
truth that unless and until hindus enter streets their voice will not be heard in india whether its bjp or congress or something else ram mandir there just because few brave hindus decided enter streets and dismantle structure built over ram lalla
good act by government for farmers

marre kisano gharwalo ko 45 lakh cash one government job but what about other 4 bjp workers 1 journalist jinko peet peet lynching mar no help please mudda uthayiye inko arthik madad milni
this not victory of punjabi farmers its victory of old ways of farming and old ways market i usually do not agree with india policy but this was something which would have thrived indian economy our villages and ways of our farmer sell their agricultural produce but this has showed something that farmers do not trust regulatory bodies and private entities
these farmers fighting against fascism named modi
india should stop trade afghanistan because india still says taliban terrorist so how can carry on trade with terrorist
whole story not shown here why doing like this quint they look like khalistanis not farmers
modi weak prime minister congress much better deal with these pet
corporate ithu muthalakkum ennu paranju oru doubt chodichotte ee paranja corporatesinu mandi marketil oru binamiye vachu koode appo will benefit more there no option for farmer sell outside mandi also athu kondu ayal mandiyil thanne vilkan nirbandidan aakum even for low cost
most of indian farmers dont go through mandi system most of indian farmers dont get msp today problems being faced from system already dependent on market people coming up with these policies bit divorced from ground realities and if this so good for everyone why rush what happens federalism when push through legislation like this merits and demerits of policy aside centre pshyological construct states reality who invest in that idea of centre if centre takes this way of functioning matter of time states start pulling away that investment
india will never ever grow or advance under democracy good luck stay poor farmers
parliament but protesting farmers unions change stand after dec 9th and want full
where were tikait before 70 years or before honorable yogi ji and modi ji
these misguided farmers actually think so
said right there in beginning of video farm laws by en large mostly beneficial farmers people hate changes and yet they want changes
farmers right there tons laws aginst fraud corruption murder rape there laws for not following laws but how many of these actually implemented how can farmers believe they can fight against giant companies in courts or tribunals for years and years
indias agriculture laws have potential increase farm income
government not responsible for farmers who lost their lives
i am from tamil nadu i love farmers of indian soil farmers source of this country i do not know language but i can understand those feelings
parliament of punjab wtf com on i support few of farmers demands but what that

ravish kumar ji true journalism true patriot sincerely concern about future of india indian may god bless more courage more energy bring true picture of common people
11 if companies or consumer sell goods with more than 70 profit of buying cost then atleast 20 of profit should provide farmers in back
fundamental problem lies in way modi brought these reforms no winning national debate on farm laws before bringing such laws no boots on ground i e no street power back reforms incapacity of indian state implement laws including overall law order modi should have learnt from his land reforms setback agricultural reforms done and dusted for next 10 15 years now i myself from jat sikh farming family in punjab supported farm reforms wholeheartedly its been textbook case of subversion of truth and society by vested interests and forces hostile india progress especially leftist clique middlemen and jat zamindars
everyone talking about bollywood and kangana ranaut but no one will stand for farmers
3 new farm bills for adani ambani not for poor farmers
first fought against british now indian government
those unaware people who shitting here should know this law not only for punjab but for rest of india
and these types of bills will continue be passed until people of india get out vote and most importantly when evm out every developed country has banned use of evm sc of germany even ruled evm as unconstitutional
also this agitation has put economical strain over already cash strapped farmers bjp played cheap politics over farmers lives
i support farm laws anti farm law protests middlemen protests so they itself anti farmer period
if these not farmer not reporter show some honesty
secondly msp only given on most rice and wheat predominantly grown in north india like up punjab and haraya which bill abolish
robust farmer organization only solution in nutshell there no simple solution problems of farmer
farmers 0 since independence
while right that any law should be made in consultation with farmers not government duty protect underprivileged may be appalling hear one uneducated but level of literacy in indian farmers considerably low not that fact as per census data collection if current system working so well how can explain no of suicides by farmers
come on its not farmers winning but mota new agenda for something big
first of all this not modi farm bill represented by government of india
no arrested yet and no arrest will ever place and no justice family of deceased farmers
shame on press abp news sold out godi media
mixing hathras rape in farmers protest deviating from mob lynchings
more over coming farmers remember people or troops who were in opposition of this farm law before going happy this termites of 4th generation war where people fight against internally
2 these bills were implemented in bihar and farmers from bihar go punjab work in fields as labourers apmc trader price maker but fir change time punjab dhaan fasl price around 1800 rupees per quintal whereas in bihar where similar structure implemented farmers sell their dhaan at 950 rupees per quintal so how this helping
so akali dal untie alliance with nda if not anti farmer untie knots with nda otherwise look like fake
from being forced sell monopoly anywhere who offers them better deal will improve farmer returns long term
farm laws repealed
farmer see draped in flag was claimed be shot dead by police later they released grainy footage some cctv camera claiming innocence but they hid fact that they had away cctv from premises where shots were fired from that footage still missing even post mortem doctor told relatives of farmer that injuries were consistent with bullet wounds but that they couldnt put their findings in writing and on record for obvious reasons
modi ji please make strategy by implying these laws in new bill should not be direct should be hidden in facade statements
before rejoicing or dissing volte face farm bill repeal we could do no worse than not examining who or what might stand reap maximum benefit from all these creative hullabaloos
i am resident of delhi i have seen how systematically farmers have followed their protests since 2 months there some local bjp people who against farmers tv channels hiding ground level reality
pakistani media spread false statement that national flag removed from pillar and khalistan flag hoisted but truth that they hoist nishan sahib flag in another pillar beside our national flag rumour spreading from pakistani side divide india
there many loop holes present in new farm bills exploit farners farmers also in favour of agri reforms but they need minimum priced fixed whether its private buyer or government itself
farmers have right protest as long do not disturb other pple activity request modi govt will do sumthing help this farmers demand our daily food from farmers all of should give respect farmers
modi ceo of adani group doesnt know india social fabric
will cover today incident 26 1 2021 while tractor march cover if have guts who were all those who attacked on police and army literally uun logo ne police pa tractor chalane koshish
farmer very hard worker they do not let down modi have do back and farmer make history
i support farmers
bill was intended for greater good and for letting farmers get their fair bit of share by open sales and not restricted mandis kind of win win situation however fear gaint companies who will offer buy their goods going impose laws and regulations which will go against common good of farmers and eventually they will start losing their inheritance on their assets moreover law will allow third party mass buyers decide rate and in due competence farmers will be compelled sell at lower price than their profitable prices even i thought bill was good later on hearing multiple agendas and possibilities i reside against
farmer disputes market prices contract farming etc matters cant up by court only up sdm seriously so basically farmers have rely on corrupt sdms solve their matters with corporations like adani ambani
adutha criminal plain da punjab farmers total india farmers appu da ready modified modi transformer of seed free farmers and urias seed with animals disease virus urias with extreme chemicals amanda modi da
farmers should have right fix price himself
even i was with farmers till december with all my heart but when protest gone violent we really hate punjabi farmers
from your video evident that these bills advantageous farmers then why farmers of punjab and haryana protesting these bills for their own good then what makes them oppose these decisions
what can we expect from ravish ji ghatna hoo apka modi virodh pakka tod marod ghuma firake aajate

one year of protest on roads during covid pandemic and then worlds biggest democracy chooses repeal 3 farm bills
what will happen once mandis closed and farmer sell at high price corporate after 2 3years there will be no mandis corporate will only buy for cheap price as farmers has no option
easy support taliban and sharia law while sitting in free country
punjab so called poor farmers either mislead or they afraid that they wont be able exploit farmers by manipulating prices and sell those crops at higher prices in trucks they living in
shameful in democratic india supreme court of india action and thanks bbc world media
im little kid i am sikh i support farmers how will they live without food
jai javan jai kisaan big win win for indian and india democracy thank farmers
yesterday when rahul gandhi spoke about compensation for farmer immediately government sent proposal for farmers agreeing pay compensation
be honest i think this victory of taliban in afghanistan would hav in bolden pakistan taliban but if they try something in same lines as what there counter breathrens did next door i believe they will get shock of there lives pakistan military not 300000 force like as next door plus has 1 of biggest airforce in world they might try something first but i honestly believe that pakistan military will them off 4 good
all farmers united n only punjab farmers targeted for leading agitations n way they pushed aside barriers clearly suggestive of genuineness of their concerns
even arun jaitley opposes these farm bills and also modi asked for msp when they were not in power
shame on indian media
adani group already started construction of huge godawns in haryana collect agriculture produce now we will eat as per their choice and price
if sp rld congress joint form government in u p then tikait baba next president of india

they really farmers because i also son of farmer from east up please i did not belong any political party or some cell as per my knowledge whole people as i know say that this some kind of propaganda running like caa nrc actually his protest have nothing do with farmer any one here can tell section wise which section not good for farmer
tikait not fool like do think will say what want him say ask some sensible questions all decisions by kisan sangathan protest all over india but concentration at borders as said all ststes organising protests farmers poor and all of them cant come delhi
excellent support farmers cause irrespective weather farmer mazdoor or not for their just demands god bless farmers majdoors
thanks ndtv stand with farmers
i love my punjabi farmers god will see through
1st became khalistan movement as we had seen redfort indian flag was removed
india will never develop what use of bjp winning majority
what about home minister amit shah all along been adamant saying that come what may there no question of taking back 3 farm bills pm modi sudden u turn and announcing repeal of 3 farm bills on national interest or on punjab and u p elections interest
omg pardon me for voting bjp in previous elections on behest of badal
bjp just behaving like congress back in 2012 2014 digging its own grave
totally inhumane people still do not want understand they r just chanting modi modi and very painful that media of our country do not want show reality
all chanting yogi and modi here should understand if these guys looked at common man lpg petrol food prices etc sirf chu bana rahein
security for farmers what security why not show figures that farmers spent for protest
they will never allow country prosper n farmers grow
major concern of farmers that gradually govt will stop buying their produce and they have suffer current situation private buying at apmcs of selling their produce at loss in private market also and their concern genuine legalised msp will safeguard farmers interest and governments promises of better rates in private market which being propagated by this bill
thanks for showing our farmers news bcz our mainstream media totally ignoring farmers struggles
removing of msp will effect farmers big time because they will lose their sure income from 2 crops wheat and rice
best analysis all indian citizens should watch this video even all farmers in india including people who agitating
long live indian farmers
even if intentions of government good in future lets say after 5 or 10 years rich corporates might start taking benefits and leave farmers hanging in middle
by election defeat in hp and rajasthan resulted in this decision if bjp loses in up then petrol diesel prices will be back upa era rates
i support farmers there vital difference in statement of bjp leaders their practical performance on ground level they officers in their ruling states unresponsive against offence followed by corruption despite written request with evidence hence they liable be rejected for ruling in future
this was meant be peaceful and farmers protest how did religion and chaos over this cause
as usual vox presenting conjecture thrive its ideologue none of three laws can be ascertained as loss making or detrimental for farmers there no guarantee in life similarly there no guarantee that these laws may not be loss makign for farmers these laws promote free trade by setting up minimum support price msp by removing mediator and giving farmers more power sell their produce anybody that they want contract farming agreement between two parties just like any other agreement where nobody supposed break contract if farmers feel they dont want get in contract then they may not nobody forcing them
can we differentiate farmers and trouble maker and niyu
more than 4 lakh farmers cometed suicide in past 20 years
actually victims of these farm acts states but states silently passing resolutions ratifying acts gst was also ratified by states without opposing them gst took away right taxation on sale of goods and services from states loss compensated by states by imposing usurious taxation on sale of petrol diesel and liquor and debates going on about loss of income states because of ensuing closure of apmcs but fact that state govts collect taxes from farmers state govts land revenue department collects taxes that why state govt officials called revenue officials and district head called collector collector of land revenue this revenue not only meets salary bill of land revenue dept but also cater developmental expenditures of states when this farming converted into trading industry states cannot tax them because corporates pay taxes central government under gst then how can state governments meet its salary bills and other needs states would become dependent on center even pay salaries its employees we have wait and see any new taxes on anvil from state governments
i so happy that scoop hoop and few other digital media outlets exists i was never ashamed of anything about my country except loons like republic tv aajtak abp india tv zee news etc etc i mean they stooped down level where even pakistan media feels better they have lost true sense of journalism but in guys i see light at end of tunnel this what called true journalism love and respect guys and your commitment shows in fact that stayed their up until 11 00 we can feel dedication and hard work behind that cute laugh
my heart with all families of farmers who lost lives of elderly members of their families
only select leaders mp or mla who have family so that they will understand pain of losing family members yogi and modi never understand this pain and public has suffer for their own act of supporting bjp modi and yogiji
i do not understand why farmers being dragged in caste politics farmers occupation based community
i would had also cleared all roadblocks these so called farmers have made
demonetization and gst were implemented when elections were around corner bjp chances in punjab slim but all other 4 states they expected get majority not sure how this decision based solely on elections in mind
7 who they its proxy war its not farmer cong agents
rakesh tiket biggest leader in farmer community
1 msp procurement by government benefits only states of punjab and haryana government wants open more avenue of sale purchase and discontinue msp procurement since huge burden on economy and favouring only few states also crops being procured by government on msp through revenue generated by government from taxes of various kinds and crops not fully sold consumed by government
i have watched so many videos on this but by far this best explanation for all three farm bills kudos
msp has become maximum sales price instead of minimum support price
modi blind supporters secretly stalking comment section end up getting depression
my request people in panjab continue supporting ajit sir ji and his channel encourage him continue doing good for farmers we should appreciate his true journalism salute sir ji
modi just using his fanatical hindus hindus together in short time and look combative and organized against his indian counterparts modi facing not only turbaned farmers but also landlord class plethora of domestic opposition parties and foreign ngos that sending rice and food and year worth of covid 19
over 140 farmers martyred in just 2 months and government did not uttered word
i was in favor of farmers till now now i regret i was wrong
i never understand that when traders can go for collective bargaining power why cannot farmers have same by making cooperative unions
why in progressive state like maharashtra farmers r not part of agitation
2 20 i would like point out that govt will not need out apmc brick by brick sir issue here that corporates have certain financial backing with which they can provide price slightly hire than apmc for couple of years 3 4 years lets assume farmers will therefore sell these corporates at higher prices and no procurement will occur through mandis this will effectively drain mandis of mandi tax and mandis will eventually fall into ruins by themselves in 5th year when corporate silos will be already full due excess procurement in previous years farm production of wheat paddy has always been greater than consumption for many years now corporates may choose not buy at all or buy at very lower prices and option of mandis at that point in time may not be available at all i hope this gets point across
i think these all so called farmer leaders traitors central government should very strict action against these low life traitors
thank bbc for covering this its so important support everyone in agriculture and farming respect their wishes if they ones growing your food theyve already suffered from cancer and disease brought on by all mandatory pesticides that overpriced and forced pay out of their own pocket if they trying up with rest of world and regulations government should pay not farmers
what about that farmers who died in protest

edit there about 100m 150m farmers in india and of 50000 protesting that too from specific state where issue of khalistan had been hot for long time does not seems suspicious
most of farmers even do not know
punjab farmers had done wonderful job in initial years of green revolution but gradually massive subsidies no income tax and msp free electricity wrong entries of kasht actual tiller status in revenue records by corrupt patwaris etc turned these once hard working farmers into super middleman and brokers for small farmers artiyas sort capitalist absentee land lordship exploitative form of functioning new farm laws gave small farmers opportunity become independent
had been any private entity would have gone bankrupt precisely why i do not understand that how procurement process going be viable for small and medium private players if only large players be involved how will they shift cost of services provided by registered mandis and arhtiyas by procuring at as minimal cost as possible or by inflating prices for consumers

at end of video one of panel experts recommended organic farming which has been covered and debated extensively about conclusion unproven snob ish will not help at all at increasing yields if not make even worse so govt should not at any cost incentivize that we should instead focus on tech that regulates and directs ample amount of nutrition directly at grassroots of crops so that we minimize exploitation and save money for both govt and farmers

ca not farmers already sell their produce consumers directly
what all need understand india has many small landless farmers who also uneducated and do not know about market or laws their produce also less sell in wholesale market as result they end up selling big so called farmers and very very low price which then sold on mandies which by way also controlled by these big so called farmers small farmers cannot sell in mandies even if they want whole protest make sure that those small farmers do not get access free market and they can be exploited by big powerful so called rich farmers honestly i feel mob accumulated as farmers not farmers thats paid mob can buy anything including mob hence education necessary for all that includes as well please read these laws mr trevornoah

4 law says that any one can store rice wheat pulses and vegetables which can be stored for long time without any limitations if this happens then rich companies can have power on deciding prices which will increase prices basic knowledge if they hold food commodities in large quantities then there would be shortage of supply then people who has this commodities will control prices

those supporting punjab and haryana farmers effectively against other farmers of india especially maharashtra where suicides maximum in 2020 if we still support monopolistic corruption ridden socialist policies and infrastructure like apmc we effectively ask for poverty ridden shitty life that we experiencing since independence support market economy support entrepreneurship will see india growing
by far best video i watched on farm bills thank bro

central govt ko farmers products warehouses aur storage facilities arrangements govt neh esh problem karya
rss and bjp new taliban this fight save democracy this officer needs resign or should have been fired by now
if there were stones pelting on zeep cars of bjps gundas then they should had stopped theirs cars instead of crushing satyagrahi kissan local press reporter and then by way if bjp gundas had been killed by kissans then these gundas of bjp would had been remembered as martyrs of bjp by making theirs staues in lakhimpur
reforms necessary in agrarian sector but should be beneficial farmers
agriculture most healthful most useful and most noble employment of man farming more than land crops and farmer our heritage existence and future modi govt have neglected truth that farmer craftsman of highest order in our planet i support our farmers
there far too many problems farmers facing unfortunately for policy making body this knowledge not available hence even though sincere effort being made by government doubling of income would be only dream what required at present identifying all factors affecting his income look for solutions each one overcome same if not possible what else can be done need systematic approach solve problem in my opinion we have not done homework solve problem we all living in fools paradise ultimate sufferer farmer his woes we have no knowledge
dictator modis ego shattered and sanyukt kissan morcha farmers labourers won
whats deal with french belgians farmers protesting and milk its always friggin milk
can see intention of govt right from start when goes with ordinance route then where those farmers and farmer orgs who approached govt and asked for these glorious pro farmer moves these defintely didnt come from farmer can watch such videos and get inkling where these ideas coming from then in which privatization right of one party approach court away this apec formula already there in bihar i think media needs go and visit bihar and study mess its agriculture in and what this one market nonsense farmers and buyers with resources even now buy and sell from anywhere now how make so that all farmers can do needs govt setup storage and improve transport and infrastructure answer not setting everything be sold corporates
i dont know about your local areas but here in lakhimpur kheri internet services have been shut down extent vi still for some reason but no media coverage or internet on this matter well i think media finding aryan khan
this not farmers protest
simply why govt introduce such laws which against farmers tell
idk why farmers of punjab and haryana having problem with new law farmers from other states really appreciating new law
all indian farmer know well modi trik
and now farmers will enjoy lavishing life economy of farmers will rise 10 times which were never happened before khusia manao congress bale hi farmers bare me sochte jamane hi farmers condition
all in all this has now become proof of concept that will of indian state can be opposed ultimately broken by well coordinated sustained campaign aided by support from foreign enemies in terms of media money management until inevitably acquires grassroots characteristic
this farm bill would have worked if first govt of india would have provided some way so that farmers can have warehouse where they can store crops till its sold at profitable price further if its law that msp has be given then they would feel more secure sure crops in india not of very high quality but that does not mean that government would put such pressure on farmers who already living in distress
police doing what upper official says them bjp trying stop who so ever raising voice against bjp
how do we explain fact that 94 of farmers not serviced by mandis but this has not helped farmers how will removal of mandis help if pvt sector has been buying at prices lower than msp
i am telling on my opinion that all these happening because of jio mart give more benefit ambani with these bill will directly entered in farming sector and will earn more profit in these sector
as son of farmer i always believed that no matter whatever government does for farmers never successfully benefitted them kisaan niwaala chhin
all farmer be unity and destroy ambani and adhani petrol pump stations and destroy only corporate company property better then we will get good result
while covered most of points of bill missed very important point that resolution of contracts etc will not be done by courts but sdm as know our farmers so game with contract law and sdms in india so honest this will work perfectly in favour of farmers whenever issue with corporation arises
shame on this type of governance where can not protest man who thrashing farmers most probably 70 of police man would be belonging from framer background but they also
i am daughter of farmer

topic i neede i had doubt from start that why not other state farmers protesting great video
modi ji app ess desh pm ess desh people ne vota paia tanu ajj up vich hoia nae
one argument against msp that causes imbalance in cropping pattern because incentivises farmers into growing crops that offer them good returns this argument classic case of putting horse before cart see like this punjab not land suited for rice and yet this happening because there no msp on crops that can handle better if government declares and enforces msp on every crop then punjab and haryana more likely shift oilseeds and other cash crops infact declaring msp only way of ensuring balanced cropping pattern
no farmers no food
taliban has also captured hero splendor plus gifted by india
if these laws passed will benefit farmers in poorer states
will increase income of farmers
all nationalist people should vote support bjp for national favour

farmers were will be foundational core asset of indian economy so need focus on empowering prospering our farming community see strong economy growth of india on global platform
exactly what said i do support this bill but msp should be guaranteed and free market should also be taxed like mandis
if this true then bjp leadership shoul apologise else people should throw them out in all coming elections give them lession

at last farmers won
farmer need only specific prices of their respective crops
clauses of contract farming act seem be written in way attract private players farming sector that may be fair from government perspective they too need be encouraged into participation but farmers have their own apprehensions so allay fears of farmers farm laws can be tried in few pilot states if experiment succeeds then model can be replicated rest of india
ajitji have really won heart of farmers for your excellent work gid bkess give courage do great things as reporter
allahamdulilha farmers real warriors

straight forward thing that if law made for farmers and they donot much sensible those laws back
farm laws were good and should not have been repealed
bbc should make video on indian media known as godi media
farmers true hero they try divide amongs farmers
poor states like bihar will suffer good luck farmers of punjab haryana and western up and for will get cheap cost labour for farm never want them grow
after listening this whole video i came conclusion that farmers lost too much
sir yogiji aggresive veer worrier karmyogi yugpurush or anantkal rahega
always perfect vision in hindsight i am sure govt will learn too when look at number of tough laws which have been passed and implemented i do not regret one of their calculations having gone wrong i feel that democracy upheld by repealing even though may not be in best interest of farmers

make more more and videos on farmers because national do not support them your work great
how could haryana police enter punjab without punjab cm permission this shows congress in nexus with bjp in farm laws
actually said something opposite what farmer leaders saying
dont think we digressing and over analyzing issue here cant we just not accept fact that they just messed up right from start they rammed laws on faces of farmers without building consensus most of farmers who voters of bjp did not understand laws completely they were perplexed because of communication gap opossition used this as opportunity further peddle their rhetoric which ultimately derailed process bjp has 150 million active members also rss they did not use them effectively communicate and make farmers aware of benefit of laws none of incumbent bjp chief ministers bothered hold talks with farmers of their respective states they over relied on modi name alone this not how push pro market reforms that too in very sensitive agriculture domain in liberal democracy where people have been living under socialist structure for far too long i believe this repeal wise step start afresh use your election machinery evangelize importance of this reform at granular level and then bring in laws
master plan so later people will not blame evm and godi media can tell u that modi g won caz think about farmers and poor people thats why people vote him
zee news also coming under bjp funding should raise voice of farmers
elections every month will evil mind at bay chest must have reduced 56 micrometers after relenting demands of khalistanis
6 how come farmers in illeagal possession of tear gas guns see picture leading national daily newspaper where did get how much did pay whom who supplied did come from china or pakistan

this channel did not show sentence which said that only thing being discussed was farmer laws was dismissing khalistani or violence link and that good

still protest going on but godi media shows nothing just wanted views at that time now have forgotten
there no point in making statements based on what happened today was resultant of continued torture and denial of rights govt imposed on farmers who were protesting for their genuine cause many of today incidents were created by other malwares should be proud that farmers still managed conduct their protest and damages ended by this i would give full credit them for conducting this neat actually i admire them no other political group could have done this with this much precision was hard blow on bjp dictatorship

love for farmers from kerala
those who protested against laws will never support this government but this decision makes rest of farmers and indians who were with government look like idiots
great video godi media could learn something
baffles me how people call violent protests like these functional democracy not speak ill of these farmers at all functional democracy one in which individual would simply vote have their voice heard yes protests guaranteed right in practically all democratic countries but they always last resort as form of self expression society which relies on such means communicate with state poorly functioning democracy if not failed one this not democracy doing its work this people trying salvage whatever left of that democracy
yaar aam admi pareshan in farmers
this will be master stroke and game changer by government if farm bills implemented and executed properly connected entair india by 5 years agriculture sector income will be more than usd 5 trillion economy
as yogendra yadav said there no laws existing in our nation which restricts farmer sell his produce outside of apmcs in fact in places like kerala which ruled by left ridiculed by gupta ji coincidentally apmcs do not exist and farmers have their own farmer produce companies moreover many of such companies hold monopoly in cash crops

problem with farmers that some have very less land about 3 4 acres farming can be beneficial if less people do rather 50 population indulge in farming if 10 were indulged scenerio were different
which shows clearly farmers interests not paramount excuse please corporate stakeholders
i think mandi will also loose competitive edge because now pvt companies can also go for cheaper price from small farmers too this means poor farmers could get better value for produce than when mandi monopolic rates so now its more like competition between mandi and poor farmers and this can not only increase productivity in farming industry but also get better produce and overall market growth

just saw republic tv reporter trying change narrative by shouting police pleading joining hands farmers
government setting up parallel markets outside mandi but there will be no tax on purchases in these private markets hence all buyers will prefer purchase from these private markets and not mandi who wants pay taxes everyone wants more profit hence farmers feel that this will destroy mandi system cos no one will want buy crops from mandi

lying i know everything because my father farmer
those who protesting worldwide friends or relatives of those farmers from state of punjab and haryana new reforms applied entire nation but community of these two states creating trouble they not realizing that reforms prevent corruption and abuses of farmers by so called commission agents
we sikh nation not hindus will not tolerate any dictatorial laws imposed on plus not msp only we will not tolerate any private player entering punjabi farms markets creating any such farm clusters
after 2002 had different thought about modi have changed that why will we change our thoughts about taliban
govt should begin understand that farmers not idiots and uneducated
intellectuals just present their opinions emphatically with limited knowledge they have in fact they cannot stand anyone opposing even their line of thought on contrary politicians esp leaders like modi who have risen virtually from nothing understand when things work against them appearing weak by giving in demands may matter lot for intellectuals not for poor poor will still fall for concessions offered them not endorse some ten twenty year goals when their day day life misery people will see chankya in modi if tikait farmer endorses bjp or they come up with new bill or they sweep elections
sir 86 farmers small scale farmer of they got 5 25 why they attempt they always happy in 25 but we have pay 100 for 5 my god middle class walo choir chalu do

modi new india
these laws back not buz govt care about farmers buz of election in punjab uttarakhand etc

time listen farmers and acknowledge concern
also said that farmers do not know about bill clearly
we have supreme court after more than 500 death in protest our justice system finally started speaking respected supreme court request do daily basics hearing on case and 24 7 and make live save our farmers jai jawan jai kisan
just think who would get benefit from this violence farmers or bjp farmers have alive protest peacefully for more than 60 days do really think that they will gamble their movement just for religious flag hosting
6 most of people were clueless in protest farm bill padhna dur mtlb nhi pta aur baithe tents me
listening dk singh anytime yes dksingh says they did support farm laws in principle yes but at same time shekar gupta was propagating about how poor farmers going suffer just by making assumptions and painting sinister color
my heart bleeds for farmers so special
for bill sone negative and positive aspects there what can we do for upliftment of our farmers constructive criticism welcome one see pathetic condition of our farmers after 73 years of our independent india some opposing modi government policy because of political and religious angle criticising group should put forward some solution easy complain but putting alternative important
stone age or talibani public farmers themselves sitting on roads blocking movement courts governments must stop this high handedness by farmers too much politics into this system being mocked every day where this so called peaceful andolan going charuni tikait all responsible instead of taking n listening sense they creating empire of their own stop this non sense
if really want know how these farm law will change agricultural sector ask average farmer who does lot of hardwork for entire year and gets just fraction of as income
no government working for farmers
even after tuticorn massacre of innocent civilians by corporate goons jaggi still supported corporations and went against interests of people there
not that i am against but going forward bills cons and loopholes should be properly discussed and place suitable checks ensure does not become another failure like gst bills which brought down economy even if govt blame on corona and millennials
when did start liking bjp boot india today becoming godi media fullest shut up yr news channel why fabricating story

man i seriously love samdish like really i have watched all of his videos over 10 times each but what saying here wrong firstly breaking of apmc mandis will let farmers sell anyone without transacting with middlemen in mandis they would not be restricted go some specific place sell their produce and can sell anyone without any consent secondly msp only required when demand in market very low and farmers having trouble selling produce why will they need msp if they able sell at price much higher than almost throughout year samdish here hid some facts because oppurtunist and wants gain support of people who do not want be informed

easy for govt pass laws and for sg sir ask farmers diversify but easier said than done for farmer switch over completely new crop and figure out everything from scratch starting from seeds right upto harvest these issues would have come out if only was not passed along ordinance route
congress party rahega aatank wadi nehi
i think that bill had two flaws 1 removal of msp outside apmc market which bad 2 non interference of government in sale of agricultural commodities outside apmc i e in private markets there could have been strict laws according how private companies can enrich farmers rather than impoverish them for their own profit making purposes for companies charging less than msp there can be strict tax laws or penalties for them
these farm laws were not there for last 50 years but farmer suicides were there there no correlation between these two things i dont know why people think that if these laws back things will be better
at morning when we started our tractor prade correct route closed by police we have no choice but follow other route that was opened by kmsc or deep sidhu followers also we did not know correct route untill we surprisingly reached at front of red fort and farmers going in or out without any restrictions as said in video decided route opened late by police and no signage was placed for farmers
when farmers against this law why hell modi government forcing them accept this law this itself proves that this law not for farmers and for corporates like ambani n adani only hats off this brave farmers
democracy against modi

except new rules not devastating they promote farmers these rules help actual farmers get fair trade bc now have make physical contracts with business that buying crops from farmers ones protesting people that buy from these farmers not actual farmers

farmers sell potatoes 10 20 rs per kilogram and chips company sell 50 grams potato chips for rs 10 means 200 rs kg

hon pm modiji decision always in interest of hindustan
hahahaha mr reddy farmers not fool
why do think that out side apmc they will sell for less outside apmc they will get 8 5 more money just by saving surcharges also they have option sell for higher also contact farming really good option instead of growing something which then they have sell in apmc here they will get contract before start farming in all developed countries they have contact farming and that makes their fathers rich companies like walmart and big bazaar government putting condition that they must purchase goods and produce from local market only in that case farmers in benefits
indians stands with farmers modi bill only for corporates sack new farm bill

when telecommunications was privatised they never said they going kill bsnl but was put on doses slow poison and corruption within has done in because spectrum owned by govt we do not understand business where in farming farmers ones who produces crop which like spectrum in telecommunications and if there dispute can not go court of law but has seek remedy from dm that like moving backwards for developing country which tops chart in most corrupt countries list
brother contact direct farmers and do some research with farmers and u will come know ground reality
but i support whatever farmers want i do not understand laws so do not know who right or who wrong here
i think all farmers should stop growing grain for people except for themselves only and private player or industries will feed all nation at cheap prices
2 why only farmers from punjab in this protest against farm laws and not from other states
protests just because something good has not been communicated well as alleged on bjp now on these good laws does not away fact that laws still v good for farmers let pl kill bjp failed communicate narrative and condemn this protest
good policy for farmers
problem that even after food surplus farmers not getting actual price they deserve
2 way front open now china border insaide khalistani kisan
if only farmers who protesting why they not coming negotiation with govt
i do not understand hindi but want support farmers and those who support them just subscribed
so this bill was about farmers or all multi layered bicholias in between that increase overall cost
really unfortunate that 3 farm bill has been back failure on part of government that could not understand benefits of bill
bjp was calling them aandolan jivi khalistani etc thn why repealing farm laws now
please form political party with name kisan mazdoor party india and participate in mp elections and also in different states assembly elections like punjab 2022 and haryana be your own boss rather than looking towards corrupt traditional parties if aam admi party can form govt in delhi then why cannot after independence this first time so many people from different states gathered under one umbrella so try avail this golden opportunity if kisan can manage this dehli morcha peacefully and properly why cannot they run country
centre has set bad precedent by giving in pressure of farmers hereafter other sections of society will follow in footsteps of farmers get their demands fulfilled
best video i have come across regarding farm bills thanks lot sir
was started by rahul gandhi during september 2020 when drove tractor rally from state of haryana punjab
this win of all of win of righteous labor farmers and most importantly democracy
we support farmers
its responsibility of indian student save their country from modi govt
seemed biased and have also not mentioned about amendment in commodities act 1955 change in essential commodities and government will not interfere till price increase upto 100 and about allotment of land big corporate houses
we support farmer
traitor rakesh tikait now give solutions farmers stop putting burden on tax payers shoulders that what rakesh tikait doing dirty politics rakesh tikait should be in jail
bitiya your spirit which won this battle for farmers
today our great republic day but on name of farmers terrorists made black day strict action needed on responsible persons they should not dare play with our tiranga my tiranga
i am farmer and i feel very sad about repeal of laws only shows how powerful middle men
owaisi help bjp win election
kisaan ko marna govt no need do any reform for farmers
congratulations everyone indian economy going be same as pakistani economy
even this not coincidence that when everyone was coming delhi first day came delhi around 5am was not stopped by police from delhi and haryana dont know why then came india gate seesh ganj sahib gurudwara and was posting everything on social media while police was arresting others who were caming delhi before and after him
no discussion and consultation was made for passing of farm laws there also no discussion and consultation for repeal of farm law parliament becoming toilet of bjp
these farmers good example of terrorism
no farmers no food remember
they acted like hynas and hunted this lion hearted sikh farmer
leaving farmers at mercy of market like handing them over death sentence
therefore govt reached spot of no return and with elections in 22 might have thought that withdrawal of three farm laws would be better face saving one than doing so after defeat in elections
become independent rich farmers struggle for preserving their vested interests sadly new farm laws were also being given communal colour govt in punjab also controlled by these very influential rich farmers lobby
sir phood dena goi must strict action against him who running this country we not dependent on who yoh at front of indian army navy airforce army havale aise bolne walo ko
must ask every farmer fighting against these reforms that now onwards how would any govt dare reform any sector especially agricultural sector this agitation was just reputation tussle not any logical base
haryana punjab especially going be heavily impacted but instead of slowly assuring farmers about laws and properly consulting about listening what they want way they hurried and passed this bill and labeled every protestor as terrorist can see where this leading up
we support in farmer movement and diljit
mappu mappu studying savarkar in modi this only election drama bjp not forget people not vote for bjp elections not banthi kia fayithahe how any people dead one year kussan protest 600 people dead kia fayithahe abi canceled gst every thing failure bjp poor people unemployed and uneducated
i stand with farmers
poor farmers have no voice these rich ones
if problem actually with over excess production of wheat and rice why did not bill focus on that specifically bill could have just disincentivise sale of these produce which would have automatically resulted in farmers shifting other produce
well saidwe stand with our farmers
legalising msp which calculated based on surplus tally right thing be done for farmers
farmers those who in support for this laws should come and protest
2019 bank scams reach record of 77000 crores and ruling party bjp has no idea what happened and media did not said small information about what modi did for rich people
their hands tied not by ropes but by greed of intermediaries that system has generated who eat up farmers income while on its way into his hands
kerala there no protest here by farmers only political drama nd bandh created by parties
always support farmers
we harming nation by these comments modi ji doing no one would have ever imagined need have some patience
jai jawan jai kisaan totally biased achor that called bjp media
i in support of farmers but today act was so shameful and all focus from farmers bill shifted khalistan matter
they produce and whole india eats farmers for their right
in short these 3 bills only good on papers but practically they will exploide farmers very badly and this only farmers can get i am standing strong with farmers
2 after killing andhra sriramulu power hungry nehru who was not shaken even by bhagat trio hanging got scared and passed linguistic reorganization bill periyar nayaka and ambedkar opposed centre formation in delhi and as per eu model demanded separate countries for non hindi regions but were not heard as racist british already raped and produced slave macaulay generation who now bollywood army and central govt employees from north indians
would not have been better if u had asked them ur home u would have saved all trouble u isolated them from most of farmers who celebrating and showing people whose agenda aligned with that of yours
but some people who hates modi and khalistanis who over andolan
only channel which presented neutral view on farm laws i do not support bjp but i still support farm laws after understanding economics behind
farm reforms must be formed by only those people who involved in this business starting from manufacturer transporter stockist warehouse distributor and price regulator other people incapable of doing
guys if these farmer bill sooooo bad why only 2 states involved in this why not other millions of farmers in india
farmers real ruler of india
proudly with farmers
congratulations bjp upon winning 2022 up elections
that we need treat goons as goons not as farmers
so either protest politically fueled or farmers misguided by those who do not like current government
long live farmers long live their patriotism long live sikhism long live their fighting spirit
shame on india hitting farmers who feed
protest taking place literally only in punjab and haryana lol pretty sure farmers exist outside of those two states in massive country of indian xd
thank so very much for repealing 3 farm laws on gurpurab god bless pm modi ji
i request india stop your nonsense put pakistan and afghanistan down jast stop taking nonsense woomen well work
aar kisan terrorist h law wapas gov ne gov chor j
this video has provided best ever discussion with farmers got know true motives of protest
teaching or trying justify farmers protest try teach do not act non sensible
agar modi bill lata hi nhi all responsibility goes one and only modi
2 i think government also creating monopoly government should maintain apmc mandis alongwith with private trade

defeat of small scale farmers allah bless them may their soul rest in peace

lallantop really do appreciable act show ground situation of hardness and sacrifices of kishan this will lead great impact feel pain of farmers in everyone heart supportsfarmers savemotherland
how about limiting number of farmers cropping same crops and or limiting area of crops for each crop example limiting sugar cane crops 1 million acres and divide that by number of farmers doing that crop then they can crop something else if they have extra land left
if farmers can sell this milk directly customers with private transportation can help them gain more money
farmer should be given freedom protest smoothly
finally arrogant government was forced bow down in front of farmers jai hind
one can see where india heading everyone must support each other and fight against modi supporters otherwise they will ruin country
liteally having tears in my eyes after scence where punjab and haryana farmer where huging each other best documentary ever i have watched on farmers now i am thiking that why we learning civivs in our schools because there no democratic right in india goverment throwing water sticks wtf happening now from daily 1 or 2 farmers dying but media not showing that and on onther hand when susand died i think issuee was there from next 6 months farmers also people only i think india becoming germany of hitler times there also same happen so people of india ope your bloddy eyes and see what happening there many people saying that there mella no people dying there so plz now call any person sitting in rain in this cold winter days khalistani or terrorists have be murderer or killer of farmers so plz dont trust any media i am with farmers kisanmajdoorektazindabad

we farmers
sikhs brave nation and one day they will have their own country in so called india because india continent of 154nations like kashmir nagaland punjab
5 due monopoly and high power in corporates they will force farmers sell contract for free
not happy with govt outrightly repealing law should have been amended if flaws there may act as catalyst for other protests across country so what will be govts action for other similar protests then we have see highly disappointed with govt repealing law under pressure where protestors have caused mayhem and ruckus in and around delhi i do not know why there were no protests around other places in country except delhi and ncr not farmers everywhere in country or govt bending ways for those who can afford protest in and around delhi and not caring for other place farmers
but all bjp cell or media only show farmer who have stone in his hand nd called him dangae
agreee i hope this issue resolves soon between govt and farmers
escapes me when sg says new laws ground breaking and farmer friendly too basically these not be called new at all these simple repealment of apmc apmc was created help farmers get fair treatment in selling their produce may have failed miserably in ensuring msp for non governmental purchase in which case new laws should be strengthen where current system fail
finally justice for farmers
farmers responsible and real and royal for democracy
thank so much sir i get more information from your channel but i will contact so which time connect your call sir please reply i am son of farmer from small village

international human rights organisations need bring this up and high light in western media also bring india human rights violations in united security council as soon as possible
i stand with farmers

very easy say that farmers must produce more vegetables edible oil but why would one do so if making less money

kafan chor arakshan chor raj mei mahila police samne chir haran jattiwadi thakurwadi yogi jahil taliban hi
farmer should not allowed starve like that government must reduce budget on arm support them
using farmers as weapons
vice team good see young people taking initiative overall good report on your next report please spend more time on what wrong with laws point by point most independent economist including at least one at world bank say these new laws will decrease incomes of family farmers and increase food prices for consumer they very cleverly written concentrate more wealth into hands of ambani adani of india not capitalism cronyism we have already seen in state of bihar where these laws were implemented at state level farm revenue has been cut in half imagine when this implemented across all of india over next decade and competition obliterated current system not perfect but that not excuse wealth from middle class and redistribute 0 000001 yes that real number 17 billionaires in india worth over 5b 1 353 000 000 population for many of these 17 though not all most of their wealth comes from massive transfer of indian taxpayer funds through corrupt contracts and transfer of indian tax payer owned assets for pennies on dollar does not come from innovation or great business acumen in fact they stifling innovation and gdp growth china not exactly model of capitalism or great governance was growing at almost twice gdp rate when their economy was at 3t these ambani adani types could teach class russian oligarchs on corruption now they have set their eyes on indian farmer unfortunately for them farmers may have allot less money because honest money but they smarter and more resourceful than these so called business tycoons
what indian farmers need not unguided freedom what needs help both financial and technological
tribute farmers lost their lives
now indian farmers would earn equaivalent american farmers now
we want hindi movie on farmers protest
3 essential commodities amendment act 2020 as part of broad strategy reform indias agriculture

thank lallantop news channel for showing farmers side
one thing clear farmers youth poor middle class asha workers contract govt employees teachers etc will change govt
i thought this press conference was change name of farmers
personally i support new farm laws but i dont get why people making such big issue over flag seems bit childish me ive seen many people favouring hindu rahstra flag over india flag but i dont care because most of people who do this innocent and not that educated guys shouldnt so seriously
demands of farmers very reasonable government should accede their demands without further delay
if not ready accept change change will change goes for both government as well as farmers
i thinks bit difficult for example my family from bihar which one of poorest state in india these new farm laws can literally make our annual income from crops twice like right now my family cultivating cauliflower and if these farm laws were in place we would earn almost 5 6 times on this crop itself but if u r rich farmer or from rich state like punjab or haryana then these laws can decrease ur income and security quite lot in simpler terms these laws giver poor states more opportunity and money and all that money and opportunity being from rich states like punjab and harayan thats why farmers of these states they only one protesting in way its kinda like socialism
sir 700 people died his party netas call farmers as terrorists and jihadists modi didnt even give single speech sadly stating like amarawathi farmers farmers all over should start walk each and every state and publish about rest of laws loss caused farmers by and fight till each and every farm bill repealed farmers should be supported by each and every state government and help them acehive
waiting eagerly on your takedown of media response on farm laws
hats off all those farmers who fought tooth and nail and finally got victory my sincere gratitude all those families who had lost their near and dear ones while fighting for nation

fear of exploitation by pvt sector misguided becoz if were be true then liberalisation of indian economy in 1991 would have made india destitute country by now for this reason support agriculture bill by modiji
shame on reporters who use their skills oppose price which by definition minimum these sold out journalist will never cover stories on why we buy items for rs 100 plus which farmers sell for 5 and why they cant get assurance sell same at say 2

congress sonia ji went away from india when farm bills were introduced in parliament facilitating smooth passage of bill and now living away from delhi pollution when farmers protesting against farm laws at doors of delhi
farmer protest wins central gov surrender
even more violent and cruel subject these farmers and their families poverty and even lower quality of life stop demonizing people who trying upscale their quality of life decent standards that have long been exploited by capitalism for maximum profits
most farmers satisfied with farm bill
important that south of vindhyas informed about details of farm bills and how they going harm farmers interests while country vast necessary that sizeable southern part not left uninformed there seems be little awareness in states of karnataka and tamilnadu or even in kerala in telangana cm kcr repeatedly announcing that his government wont implement new farm bills as they go harm interests of farmers excepting this there little commotion in southern states generating opinion in southern states will be important element for success of farmers country shall speak with one voice or else there will be doubts about reasons and motives of movement
big victory for farmers unity in farmers once again proved itself like bhagat singh had gotten victory over britishers by hunger strike was continued more than two months
well examples given did not rise up actual problem because always been double edged sword in which only farmers will get killed by that sword i support protest because acts shamelessly passed just because finance minister does not eat onions onions out of essential commodities so its baseless that people think that middle class person eats burger from mcdonald than eating cereals like barley and rice

3 how can bill on farmers price assurance be truly effective in absence of price regulatory body so that farmers do not fall into exploitation of big industrialist groups

voting ultimate protest in democracy no policy of elected govt can get 1 billion people support even if 10 against then 100 million people protest
truth that if these farmers then kasab was freelancer
two years back even farmers from tamil nadu protested in delhi and this govt did not even care about that
implementation of msp will cause food price inflation which will require doubling of minimum wages across india which means shutting down small medium businesses creating feedback loop of destruction new agriculture bill aims correct that by shifting price burden on private sector thereby making sustainable long term arrangement benefitting both sides
negative talk on bjp future impact ambhani growing day by because of this type beneficial bills 4g cab

guys your video really good but i belong farmers background and i am keeping active watch on protest from bengal but as i know bills most favourable co operate families like ambani as u have said in your video that there should be people who will make farmers understand contracts so what if one who explains contract also bribed by rich and due this suppose if in contract time period in contract for example 5 years and one explaining says as 3 years then farmers will not be able work in his own field freely which his ancestors have made by working day and night
well done farmers takes big person recognition his mistakes well done modi now bring country together
people who saying these bill good do they even know how these bill were passed opposition was outside parliament and bjp leaders were passing bill one after another without any discussion

another thing most of small farmers were already being exploited by bigger farmers since these bigger farmers were buying crops at price lower than msp point of this law was provide path for smaller farmers sell their crop directly wholesalers which would guarantee them better price than if they had sold these bigger farmers about giving smaller farmers more agency over price that they receive for their crops this two way argument cannot talk about one side and ignore other

how come manifesto of all major political parties had somewhat same kind of farm reform laws in even 2019 i guess different government committees in past 20 years studied this matter and also suggested about farms reform even rakesh tikait at first praised reform and later dissociated from in fact print reported that kaushik basu also had same kind of suggestion congress but when laws came through nda started come up with different problems in this law definitely failure of demonetization made pm weak as cant say now that whatever decision takes will reap good so failed push hard for these reforms as credibility already questioned on one major reform i e notebandi

i think as per apmc laws buyers have pay tax cess mandi fee not farmers information given in this video seems be incorrect because non apmc mandi will not have any tax or commision buyer can pay more farmer even after retaining his share of profit thats why farmers may get better price in non apmc mandis apprehension that after few years because of less transaction happening through apmc infrastructure will become unoperational and then private buyer will start squeeze farmers but as i said its apprehension

mr tareq fateh normally i agree with most of time i always like listen in various discussions in this discussion while i think pakistan indeed in cahoots with taliban by supplying arms etc but there others also however i completely disagree with your suggestion that india should send several thousand soldiers in afghanistan was kind of foolish say that we have 2 million strong army and soldiers not here look at what do think 5000 soldiers can deal with 25 000 strong taliban when indian army most likely does not know terrain rule that should get into fight where do not have decent chance of winning any war has have goal what goal of indian army in afghanistan please make guess equally foolish say that babur came from that area babur did not come from afghanistan as know however babur and other came in 15th century this not 15th century i am truly surprised by your silly illogical and wild comments in this discussion truly surprising situation in afghanistan tragic there no fast solutions we have see so far as india concerned if indian leftist intellectuals and 5th element in control india can care of foreigners i am more afraid of enemy within

farmers have been there for months all away from their families no one wants be there
in contract farming there was also loophole like if any businessman refuses purchase contracted crop then who will action that was in hand of sdm of that area no farmer could go court for that so that was totally blunder but with few changes that law can provide good benefits farmers

best video i can recommend anyone talking anything about farm bills watch before giving any opinion
bjp cell active for manipulative facts didi know these bills beneficial for corporate world not for farmers but actually diverting mind of people against farmers
would love see samdish cover whole protest until our beloved farmers get what they want and until then samdish providing them love and support
i wish should also cover other 90 percentage farmers which not in punjab and haryana whats their view and what they will gain from this law
sir problem this mindset of on name of quality farmers get exploited sell below msp cost price hence harder sustain and finally quit sell farm or commit suicide
should ask income will be double not crop price will be double and ask him how rakesh has accumulated so much wealth
best would be have definitive plan laid out which has crop diversification and compensation money states as suggested incentivise farmer from current practise would have be done over minimum period of five years
based on mos son mobile location which clearly shows was present at that location of attack on farmers enough evidence arrest that person see how they were openly threatening farmers

1 first bill not mandatory on farmers meaning farmer can choose if wants go for contract farming or not in case if feels its not going be benificial for him can continue in normal way growing and selling apmcs or in open markets second bill
only 36 of agriculture produce sold through mandis and that too mainly in punjab and haryana so we need actually replicate that system and expand mandi system elsewhere while leaving farmers at mercy of private player with no safeguards not solution
using jeep as weapon and weapon was supplied by so why ajay mishra saying not involved if claims and his son were not present when farmers were killed than dawood and osama were not present in new york or mumbai where people were killed but we blame them because they provided weapon and ideas were master mind of whole operation
not victory faliure for farmers

big bang reform may be difficult government after cool off period should experiment with full private supported value chain models farm fork and stabilize better produce and payment will naturally attract more stakeholders proof of concept i know i am talking corporate utopia if successful makes larger implementations easy
istandwithindianfarmers
could 2 3 years for this get implemented in better manner but this bill was needed india cannot become 4000 gdppp or 10 trn dollar gdp with rules and regulations of 1960s and 70s apmc made sense back then but not anymore

modi government work for few oligarchs not for 130 crore people of india
what shame this been against farmers common on modi they farmers who feed our stomach not criminals nor terrorist we indians all will forget all these incidents during election time and will vote again and will make him pm again common people
reduction in percentage of gdp in farming due growing industrialisation and over all size of economy increasing does not mean that money in agriculture drying over growth in agriculture produce and investment has been positive adjusted for inflation except couple of years after 2014 few facts need be checked
indian farmers should be definitely taught about this bill
this what that india always doing in pakistan by his planted grup
can we expect protests from farmers in favor of farm laws
bjp agreed because of election results only
great farmer

for those who do not understand hindi said more than 80 farmers have died during protest because of suicide and sizzling winter in north india
this unfortunate decision small farmers want maintain their rents from current system at cost of market efficiency they hampering industry growth and nation progress one day i hope these reforms will be rammed through
man should be building large storage centers and warehouses help small farmers store their grains and perishables so that they can sell at right time provide short term loans against these stocks instead of building 800 cr parliament
farmer respect republic day and their country property as well as country flags

black spot in history of india killing our own food feeders taking part in issues people facing certainly great if people want feel faith in congress party should be democratic first and then people should have feel that party belongs people of india and not of some individuals and families
but actual point nobody force any farmer make contract outside mandi market
durand line not in quran or geeta was drawn by british who looted india how ever matter has been resolved we talibs know not quarrel pakistan country who gave bread for so long
most of time i think stream media part of talibans or supporting talibans no one talking about northern alliance resistance glimpse of hope which could really use support of them but yet no one talking about them

taliban can be neutralised by india
why only punjab haryana
very good analysis of problems of farmers really appreciate
this khalistan protest not farmers protest

nexus of khalistan taliban active under access of active now but government in centre only busy in meeting eating and sleeping
only god can save farmers yet farmers will still loose for fair price who will be left in hands of middlemen hoarders and corrupt politicians who will control price rest of farmers of india were so happy that they got better price for their crops and accepted agricultural laws leaving only punjab farmers under pressure from middlemen and foreign funds protest who were not even paying tax and controlled price shame
yes said everything in support of bill but what will be method of selling items these big corporates will they provide facility or medium contact each and every farmer who have land of 100 500 sq mtr will his crop also sold like big farmers and what if crop standard will not match with company norms will they be hold responsible for taking crops please suggest this point also how can small farmer will contact these corporates and like said most of farmers uneducated will they be able cop up with big fat contract of compny and if something will go up and down how can that issue be resolved suggest that point also

mr gupta if farms laws were good for farmers they would have any time farm laws for corporates in name of farmers if really believe they for benefit of farmers do episode on no point repeating government rhetoric

if this would have been done by bollywood star or muslim imagine what headlines and strict actions and godi media tamashash would have been made
wait what hell truth there clear video of farmers tilting car and smashing driver with sticks what truth
urban housing societies be promoted as marketing societies also so that farmers output fpos rural coop of youth can be purchased directly these 3 acts could have been more beneficial for such marketing but now lost opportunenity

farmer sowed seed god jesus n bible seed of god word satisfied ur soul by his death n ressurrection c bible in google
normally i am not inclined comment but after this ctc necessary say needful would have been truly impartial review of farm laws if had immediately stated all of what have stated in this episode as part 2 of first ctc episode this one appears almost reflection of what stream media saying right now below expectation
these laws back not beacause government care for farmers this because upcoming elections in up punjab uttarakhand etc

lot of respect for modi ji
violence has never been or will be solution of any protest in my opinion what happened today on eve of republic day was very unfortunate and should be condemned but govt should also understand policy or bill should not harm any group of people and can seen from past few years all amendment and bills brought by govt has been opposed by various people of country let say caa now farm bill govt should look into this matter seriously happy republic day brothers and sisters
plz make short documentary on farmer protest from may 2020 we will share if possible for this paredes video wah
modi does not want repeat of post bengal voilence in punjab since china at our border may look stupid but real possibility otherwise why appolozied instead just revoked i do not think right criticize modi but we lack unity that modi has confident will come back power

modi ji should bring back laws no matter what small farmers will be benefitted
this failure of farmers and won for middle blood sucker
after winning election bjp govt does this everytime
farm laws were surely dead before arrival just from different perspective farm laws needed regulation market economy when introduced needs regulation laws failed introduce regulation therefore neither market economy or market freedom dead before arrival joint study reforming agri markets in punjab in federal context by iim and punjabi uni patiala authored by sukhpal singh depicts well
international media can speak for if we can dicuss there matter like amzon fire india one of largest democratic country if democracy effected effects credibility of democracy all over world
modi now been considered as manhoos in global world reason when supported trump trump gone india supported sheeroon israel pm sheeroon gone india supported ashraf ghani had leave afghanistan supported armenia ended up in breakdown of armenia and list can go on and on

this not work of farmers goons saale
who really responsible for death of 600 farmers
bill also mentioned that any farmer can sell their produced yeild at mandi as before other than this if they like corporate offer thay can sell corporate
we farmers who r very down 2 earth not politicians like u kangna who barks everytime speak that much which others can tolerate otherwise u will have 2 pay for this
back square one now i think another group of farmers will start protest and create problems for bringing back i think farmer situation hopeless they themselves do not know what they want
4 why such huge population from punjab has settled in usa and canada exploit gains of capitalism but oppose any step towards in india
interfering indian govt and farmers
victory of our farmers well done
goverment should not roll back farmer ordinance some changes should be made but completely rejecting ordinance not solution
khalistan punjsb annexe report from british government has been sent and from uk supreme court by sfj and nothing can stop dream of having our own land back india had its opportunity for 70 years work with sikhs and respect our freedom and beliefs but instead we were treated like guardians of hindustan shri guru granth sahib ji was disrespected time after time after time and one generation of sikhs inpunjab were murdered by indian state for decades our people have lived under threaten by indian central government if they thing farmers will clear decks of delhi then they even dumber than previous guardians of indian government modi will be hung and his entire chain of command coming as far as cabal and billionaires will all be extinct withing next 12 months just like mughal empire and general odwer

neither rakesh tikait economist nor any agro specialist why this unwanted and antisocial person called on tv debates unnecessary camera exposure has channel not got any reasonable personality
i am surprised that almost no one in india ever bothered improving rnf sector rural non farm sector at national level these generally industries that suited operate in rural areas will help diversify rural economy agriculture products used in whole basket of industries as their primary inputs on top of being used as food so will help create additional demand for agricultural crops which means farmers will get more places sell their crops
i stopped using jio cleared reliance from my demat account standing with our farmers some people may think that i am idiot profit important but business ethics necessary full support our farmers love

these farmers r supported by bjp
sir i am great fan of cut clutter and follow avidly your analysis of international geopolitics however your analysis of agricultural economy in context of ongoing farmers protests left me unconvinced in my perhaps simplistic view imbalance in agricultural production rice and wheat versus oilseeds for example can be corrected simply by rebalancing procurement prices disservice farmers in bihar due low priced availability of foodgrain procured in punjab and haryana seems be matter of bihar having abolished apmc act and not giving its farmers incentives available farmers in punjab and haryana why cannot government simply increase procurement prices for oilseeds maize etc and reduce them proportionately for rice and wheat why do we need new law and open doors for ambanis and adanis into agriculture why cannot fci simply export excess foodgrain rather than allow them rot in open storage why must we allow ambani adani crony capitalism into agriculture when absence of big business did not prevent from getting out of cycle of famines and become self sufficient in food did not get answers these questions from this episode clutter was not cut
problem only 2 state was following msp properly so farmers over there having problem but they still have option continue with same just farmers who do not want sell in maandi they can move out and find other options
if each and every party protesting against one party then bjp 1000 right

when change government happens one day parties that opposed today may start singing another biggest drawback of ruling parties their illusion of majority and power majority fickle because based on first past post and not 50 votes that why forthcoming election generates fear and all bravado vanishes unfortunately these elections able influence only negative feelings and convergence set of positive feelings not generated by them consensus building art all political parties have learn we have seen nearly same ideas getting supported or opposed based on make up given their avatars farm laws were talked of by congress but they readily joined agitators because they thought can be way defeat bjp congress clueless party that could not find robust growth model all about appeasement all time bjp should also realize they running out of runway and if can not usher in reforms with adequate consensus building approach they will also crash all so called majority governments have just about 30 votes only

govt should declare its targeted purchases of food grains under food security law wheat rice dal etc at least 1 year before and announce schedule of quantity and quality of its purchases from different states and mandis along with start and end dates msp declared before sowing starts should spread its procurement widely and not concentrate only on punjab haryana and up should not purchase food grains beyond minimum buffer stock requirements this will remove undue benefits farmers from these 3 states getting but central govt should also remove all subsidies gives and distribute amount saved as dbt all farmers in country along with minimum income support all farmers and landless workers this will free farmers decide what and when and how much produce and will change conditions for better

sir i think its time for farmers understand now they demanded repeal and now its done still protests on going and they came up with 6 7 more demands this ultimately causing inconvenience
people who neither farmers nor understand ground realities have crafted these laws start small test and then scale do not assume just like assumed benefits of demonetization grandiose egoistic plans do not always succeed
these farmers can never succeed because there no iota of truth value in their struggle for regression into land lord feudal caste based class structure struggle against parallel competitive market actually fraction of desert land enough produce food than so many of them inefficiently do they can use high capital intensive techno agriculture which they cannot opt within outdated regressive government supported expensive cultivation of unwanted crops using bloated employment patterns that flourishes only narcissist identity cults media uses fuel hatred for somebody like ambani adhani not at all related media punjabi vs gujarati because modi from gujarat even mahatma statues defaced they spin narratives phoophooing nationalism because modi represents national interest they push hatred for hindutva because modi hindu they even sell dislike of chai wallas as they dislike modi what nasty distance narrative pushing can go
shocking me see intellectual like vary happy with bjp election propaganda

unfortunately as justified as protests reforms along with gras roots level awareness programs onky way reform punjab lopsided agricultural sector that riddled with structural inefficiencies and lack of capital too many people chasing too little capital somethings gotta give either small holding farmers move onto other sectors while increasing holding size for ones left behind or they shift other crops that less water intensive like rice which fuels alarming rate of ground water extraction in punjab which incentivised by govt policies rice farming in northern india disaster if these farmers cant see that drought that cant be managed will indian governments central and state not exactly known for competancy let alone efficiency these policy measures of intrusive state support for inefficient farming kick started this whole thing when india was facing famine and living on american grain exports those days long gone indian government scared of people making noise about rising food prices so by their logic from crisis management point its better deal with relatively small number of farmers than incur tye wrath of gigantic indian consumers these protests result of failed policies that supported inefficienct farning in one of india most fertile regions for decades farmers merely looking out for their livelyhood doing what govt policy for longest period has dictated these reforms should have been carried out atleast two decades ago punjabi sikh farmers doing well in other countries why not in india idiotic state intervention from well intentioned but misinformed socialistic policies
great go ahead farmers neither they will get tired or give up until three bills back by ego central government whole nation with farmers those against these farmers dont deserve eat anything
i know private companies may do monopoly as u said examples jio but they will increase competition and healthy environment for farmers as jio did farmers will start taking its benefit by cultivating many crops rather than rice and wheat and sell them in market

sorry i am from australia so trying understand most farms in india very small between 5 and 10 acres farmer afraid that they will lose minimum support price there for they will eventually need sell their land large companies start buy farms on mass and effectively destroy farming communities but would i be wrong in saying that solution might be form co operatives in local farming communities create stronger bargaining position
but if i may ask what loopholes in bill how can fail why government so arrogant why ordinance route if corporates try manipulate system what poor farmers can do privatization not inherently bad but there should be some failsafe mechanism and people who disagrees with stop harassing them peace

i have listened various opinions on this topic farmers bill was put forward with best intentions however external forces funding this protests extremely strong most important reasons why pm would go on backfoot 1 meeting with capt amrinder in oct where submitted report and there was cross verification done on his claims regarding increase in anti india activities in punjab 2 supreme court has put stay order since jan 2021 and recommendations put forward by panel no action has been so honestly bill has been dead for long 3 i dont think that pm would withdraw something becoz of up or punjab election with or without farm bill vaapase bjp still has strong hold in up bjp will never win anything in punjab anyways 4 bjp leadership must be acutely aware that repealing one bill would bring other issues be challenged as well like caa i would like understand this better in coming days no matter what i will still support modi n yogi unless someone can show me better leader that him do not ever dare bring mamta or kejri that will be end of swatantra bharat

laid threadbare logic behind msp and why was needed then and how has outlived its utility and how state of punjab skimming off msp finance its agricultural mandis and also rear within its precincts parasitic class of arthys who too cohorts with government in skimming off portion of msp and pocket for themselves so situation of i scratch your back scratch mine between government of punjab and arthyas as said laws were in right direction but was enacted so hurriedly as give rise misgivings even in minds of farmers who stood benefit from most arthiyas took full advantage of apprehensions of farmers and cooked their own geese in fire of farmer misgivings in fact i suggest leaf from book of kerala which has been most welfarist and socialist but has not mandated such mandis for farmers in fact farming in kerala has shifted more cash yielding crops such as rubber cashew etc i suggest do video on farming practices in kerala and why there no farmer suicides there suicides of farmers may be talking place but not for indebtedness incurred for cultivation

1 did parliament have power pass farmers bills
everyone gangster until farmer start speaking english
sir farmers also not against this bill until promises from government not only words in air they just need assurance in written that msp should be paid them and why government cannot add this point into bill getting profit from privatization will be just bluff

very aptly put by sg i was waiting for sg clutter however i do not agree when sg says repeal was only option left bjp they could have made some changes law and left states implement states where people more entrepreneurial in nature like gujarat rajasthan maharashtra might have accepted this law and punjab haryana up could have tried this later
just teaches one thing that never waive small farmers loan even if they do suicide because they one who supported politically backed famers

all reforms for private will come first with benifits continues with exploitation ends with deaths of poor because indian politics controlled by corporates see sufferings of communist china who used their welfare ideologies corporates we need proper interactions and convenience people if they can not believe in speaker or doubts about future repeal but i also appreciate narendra modi ji for his various initiatives india born with protest no army weapons power stopped indian freedom from british same way once massprotest accepted by common people then governing leaders need strategies stop
need expand your reseach hear voices in other states as well india huge country and punjab and haryana not only states that we have if go state like bihar will get know that no farmer can just choose produce what wants sounds unfathomable right but this what traders and mandis impose on them they dictate what farmers must produce and they also dictate when farmers can sell not when farmers want but when they want there not enough cold storages in other states and small farmers always exploited by so called mandis and traders there many new food processing companies coming up and they would like procude directly from farmers while cutting middle man middle man should have been focus of your video

mr rahul actually in 2011 and 2013 congress brought this bill introduce
example of sugar cane private factories even though msp there but sugar cane farmers at marsy of private factories in terms of payment of their crop payment can be delayed upto 8 9 month and sugar cane 1 year in field so indirectly farmers receive fruits of their hardwork in 21 months after that much waiting that fruit also becomes rotten because farmer has so much debt that money goes repay debts of banks
govt brings industrial policies after discussion with industrialists in five star hotels but acts as all powerful and omniscient while bringing farm related laws no discussion treated like something insignificant and dependent we participants in democracy listen ensure enough checks and balances make stand before big corporate first create job so that children of farmers can find jobs otherwise stop projecting yourself someone as benefactor pull not push we voted for your because did better in gujrat and use as model now people of punjab and haryana have bihar as model where apmcs were abolished and we dont find that encouraging we not regressive which hell bend on protecting just loyal land and not want be second class citizen under riches include in law making process we will support positive reform

research provides very limited view of problem please check how many farmers were actually able sell crops at msp before this law this law takes power away from traders who exploiting farmers today whether alternative big corporates will actually exploit farmers still just hypothesis

amrullah saleh will be declared terrorist soon and taliban as sons of soil who fought for their freedom this will encourage other terrorist organisations do same
i think what was real protest now has became more like political war between centre and farmers union this makes real reason faded and get dissolved in politics i really hope farmers get their demands and centre might actually listen them but modi called these people andolan jevi dumb understand that his ignorance and dumb logic of his bhakts making things worse just my opinion
these laws optional n that end of debate govt already agreeing have demanded ammendment but few protesting as farmers totally scrap this pro farmers laws

farmers in india facing bigger problems than this
in modi yogi we trust

bills do not force farmers change track they only give more options can choose option or not your choice real problem of protesting farmers that they used go buy produce at much lower cost from bihar and sell at msp as their own produce now msp will be linked land records so these farmers cannot cheat other farmers and will get their share of msp benefits of course these farmers protesting punjab has become hub for drugs christian conversions and anti india activities these being bred by foreign hands destabilize india today water table in punjab has sunk very low where could often see atician wells they have disappeared grow rice need certain amount of rainfall punjab much below that greed of few killing them protest totally wrong sadly money coming from opposition foreign lands that want destabilize india and psudo sikhs who want form khalistan and being used by islam against india anyone supporting them knowing or unknowingly behaving in anti national way

thanks jatta u really helped raise voice of farmers
next year there elections in uttar pradesh and there opinion polls coming down that why they repealed laws only up elections which bow them down

farmers of punjab get free water and electricity at cost of taxpayers if not farmer cost of electricity in punjab highest in country high electricity costs mean that no company will set up modern industry in punjab

all highly recommended farmers having much more money can do anything not small farmers nearly 70 appreciated this type of gathering because they getting their money in time
congress sajis 200 farmers sit on protest
one draw back politicians will loose commission income which they used loot from poor farmers for last 70 years and their cartel can not decide selling price of any produce of farmers no doubt state govt will loose 10 mandi tax levied on poor farmers but state govt can easily make up for above losses by increasing tax on liquor cigarettes etc or by curtailing free bees given rich people like free scooters given working women free laptops given students of rich people free rations given govt employees tax payers free deepavali and pongal gifts given affluent families levying 10 tax on donations received by trusts owned and operated by politicians levying 10 cess on pension money received by politicians like mla mp municipal councillors etc as donations received by any political party and pensions received by mla mp councillor etc exempted from income tax state govt can levy just 10 cess compensate loss caused due forecasted reduction in revenue on mandi tax etc

however discussed only flaws of various apmc acts and existing practices not how new bills will resolve these issues except few did not discussed about new bill for agreement between farmers and sponsors how disputes among them will be resolved what will be power of courts in this regard what if sdm unbiased or his decision otherwise prejudice farmers what if produce will not match quality grade standards criteria inspection will be done by sponsor and they can reject price can be varied and corporates smarter than innocent farmers and they may undue advantage of section 5 bargaining power of big corporates may induce individual farmers sell their produce at lower price no other central law prohibits corporates can now stock huge in their cold storage and sell later at higher price
simple solution solve problem for grain storage would be that farmers can form their own regional cooperative like amul will reduce financial burden on government and at same time empower farmer concept of msp on all crops not feasible will increase fiscal burden on government
poor farmers giving everything
7 all contracts between farmers and companies or consumers must provide compulsory insurance against any misstatement or fraud

i farmer and i know that each of these bill will eventually help farmers whether big or small and for those who think why farmers protesting its all politics just like anti caa and cab
this people who protesting even do not know what amended farmer bill
sikhs will always regret rejecting offer made by british get their independence by making west punjab their own home of khalistan
4 sir i am not well aware of farm laws yes i believe that msp may increase food subsidy but indirect removal of msp through farm laws not in interest of farmers future government did not included msp in farm laws only ensure guaranteed price which governed by private trader and farmer and we well aware farmers were not afford negotiations with such big players government says msp administrative matter not legesative in my opinion government must ensure msp farmers in written form for safeguarding interest of farmers
i have come across many comments saying farmers with luxury vehicles there for they fake
taliban india we will exterminate frm this planet
actually three farm laws was kill small farmers anyone can buy crops without proper system because of mass production of crops private buyers would not give good prices and if any one not paying after buying crops farmers could not go court they can only go district officers but due corruption district officers would not listen farmers farmers dont have storage systems in india due which they cannot regulate market market would be regulated by big corporations and they would decide sell and buy prices hundreds of farmers died at protest but govt did nothing not democracy not bjp doing only for votes farm laws was just for business and corporations they would have crushed middle snd small farmers in india 70 of people dependent on farming but government did understand government told that they not farmers they terrorists good for prime minister say these words for farmers and see now how changed his views worst pm
sir what about mandi tax which licensed trader has pay in apmc wont neo liberalism attract more private traders beacuse they wont have pay this tax in apmc catering towards downfall of apmcs so now farmers will still have msp but there chances of selling at profit at apmc will reduce but before these ordinances they had safety net of msp while also chance of making good profits now because private traders will move out farmers cannot be certain of getting that msp i just had this small doubt
ndtv only channel who talked in favour of farmers
we need strick msp laws and msp farmers right
though i do not agree with shekhar gupta on many issues still i agree that bjp must not alienate sikhs win even if farm laws right they must try end crisis without further delay and in such manner that sikhs do not feel cheated if they nationalists they must be able see repercussions in long run
if wanted see these day then what was lack in congress home guard under haryana police inspector bribe every time i suffered from these many times even these days i had done electricity theft complaint but no action even they open my name this happen under bjp government now i hate bjp government and their partiality policy no value for honest civilian

who needs spokesperson when have media channel like india today supporting them
republic day happens ever year its show of our military strength now our brother farmers want show their love for this country which denied all these years so nothing wrong in showing tractor rally which reflects soul of country not arms but tractors
ravish mahapanchayat was mark my words day history of this country will remember when we look back in history of india naturally historians who writing present day will try write otherwise farmers have given message loud and clear and even if for graceful exit if not for politics government should pay attention their demands if not vinashkale viparit buddhi will be so apt and fitting proverb
this step not in interest of majority of farmers in long run no govoerment further will dare agri reforms poor farmars will pay cost
sir with due respect what explain that at for good for ideal condition i am giving one example what explain considering bihar in up sugarcane most common products apart from government purchase its private prices almost half with same day payment not 10 less while discussed case of rs 1600 100kg for bihar for commn wheat draw back of agriculture storage and safety i mean self life of commodity lesser than any of products
govt should strengthen apmcs so that every farmer get benefit otherwise will remain as political gimmick
kisan neta must be arrested against this heinous act
first private companies gonna give higher rates for few years so then no one will sell msp so basically msp gonna finish in few years then these big corporations will not have any competition then they will play with farmers they will decide their price farmers will not have any option than selling their crops on lowest price only punjab and haryana has msp system and farmers of punjab and harayana has highest income in this country if msp working for then we should change other states of india already has open market and whats going on there how rich r farmers getting there bihar and up already has this option but people from these states r coming punjab and haryana for labour jobs
congress bjp and even communist party all several colours of chaddi gang they all

i can understand your disappointment disagreement with pm on repealing of farm laws but all these theories about electoral gains and winning elections at cost of people nation way too harsh without any substance i still feel has better perspective about everything since occupying chair not and me so instead of giving knee jerk reaction wait and watch
they will implement open market only few plyers having biggest warehouse and cold storage facilities will become top bidders u can guess who they will determine price naturally who can compete with giant noone they will determine price this retail giants ordinary consumer will pay like petrol and diesel after right determine price was shifted companies
congratulations farmers of punjab indeed stainless steel

4 20 4 55 wow so from here on out your whole argument only about surplus crops farmer has after has sold his crop at previously decided price corporate how much that surplus 1 2 5 how much this heading into conjecture territory now surplus only will not be able sell surplus for msp which will lead fall of overall prices and farmers will lose negotiating power because of that surplus crop that in this hypothetical scenario could not be sold sense baat 10 surplus 10 crop will cause remaining 90 crop value crash serious and for comparison this already has happened in milk poultry fish and they all do better than cereals and sugarcane which beneficiaries of msp and untold subsidies upto of 1 22 lakhs per family in punjab why has not happened there hum khote we met style chao aage badho aur gyaan hi do

congress having allowed dynasty enjoy power without accountability even party paying price let congressmen come out dynasty trap only way congress can be resurrected dump dynasty and serve as constructive opposition irrespective of what bjp did when was in opposition this their moral responsibility especially when they enjoyed dynastic power for 70 years
indians have little work do so they all do politics this talk also obsessed with political fallout of annulling farm laws rather than long term consequences on indian agricultures future modernization of farming practices how will indian agriculture produce be competitive on global scale

we can see only punjab farmers since 2 months of protest why ist so its hijacked from khalistan protestors
modi weak i want against punjab farmers mad
correction bro only 30 farm union supporting not 400
similarly entire price control mechanism has been managed by these middlemen class who mostly form working base of political parties hooligans people with larger syndicates around them they one who get licenseses from government control everything regarding price hoarding i will bet its them who have put this restriction on onion export so that local market price can be controlled they also controlling unions those who put up these colourful protests everywhere know people who facing blowbacks its farmers majority of our farmers who effected directly by this would come out actually support this bill if food supply chain has be freed from middlemen palm then introducing free market best only option for our middleclass hypocrisy should end somewhere
solidaritywithindianfarmers
why does government want three farm bills remain and also minimum support price msp
why were farm laws repealed
modi ji pllzz try send those farmers their home who lost their lives just because of yoyr ego their families waiting welcome them

congress and other party knows rule very well what converted wants meet their families at this crucial time when government wants control that area supporting your government makes stupid at this time also then i would like vote bjp once again
channel every farmers says law should
as for central government perception this act may root out all concerns of indian farmers and i wish good luck but my concern on execution strength of governments especially central government because reforms by modi government become curse people of india in every aspect for example note ban by government become grave small scale industries even after completion of 4 years bad impact of that decision not come down due that decision unemployment rate reach mountain level in our country same thing in matter of gst also our constitution always taking about decentralisation of everything but due gst in financial matters central government become iron hand and now states become minority share holders in financial spectram of our country same thing happened in lockdown issue also we all feel be shame after watching such painful visuals of migrant people here my question and concern that whether central government creat any platform perform this act without mistkes if this act become one more failure act india will witness very painful situvation before making these kind of laws center go one piolet project in particular state and find out result and make any correction which needed implement all over country with out having any ground work they think implement never be good because strength of this government not up mark in implementing of these kind of acts most of indians face bitter experience due acts of this central government
i concerned that media and these liberals dragging india back dark times of congress rule sad see indian will never become like united states or west where they embrace meritocracy capitalism and lower corruption looks like india going back congress rule and back 2000s era policies and politics of dynasty rule and nepotism thank media and delusional liberals thank
last year tamil farmers went delhi and protested for months together nothing happened i expect same for punjabi farmers why because if modi government gives in then sign of weakness and bjp cannot afford this
pathetic apology by modi basically says i am sorry farmers too dumb understand we know better what good for then would know yourself
thanks for your social media support regarding indian farmer need more from everyone
this exactly what we telling our muslim brothers and sisters of indian subcontinent including pakistan since that time when turks and arabs made them slaves of their culture

if handful of people have opposed farmer law what happened rest of farmers either they not aware or dont care if they dont care about themselves what bothers govt leave so many people died why no protection no law i had minimum 5k people roaming around me if atleast 1 person was taking care of 1 farmer they would have been alive today i dont know why this party donno how protect their own people instead of wasting their energy and time on people like me im neither farmer nor in defense nor in politics prime minister apologizing weak or congress strong
thank u sir for this wonderful lecture clearing all doubts related this farms bill
such disappointing design will boost moral of such groups running parallel govt and they will interfere in designs of democratically elected govt still love modiji if modi government stepped back then believe me no one will try revolutionize agriculture sorry say but we do not deserve be super power

why whole india has bear loss of farm laws for one single state farmers from rest of country kerala karnataka up bihar west bengal andhra pradesh supports farm laws because d help them sell their crop directly market but these greedy punjab farmers actually they more buyer and seller want continue loot farmers of whole country

should also say that in 2014 bjp said they will give atleast 50 more msp if they come into power been 6 years now still nothing and now this bill bjp always lies istandwithfarmers
if taliban wants rule afghanistan following iran taliban must be educated enough understand that taliban mullah far far behind iranian mullah in intellectual thoughts viewpoints tolerance and above all mentalities without election if taliban wants rule by force in name of islam and quran situation will not be better than before
defeat of small scale farmers

zbnf farming way forward govt schemes though well intentioned will be squandered by systemic bureaucracy selling at msp mis result of not adopting marketing value add or forecasting methods by farmer
absolutely loved last part if there indicative price realtime application for prices of farm produce would be awesome
modi repeal 3 farmers law immediately bow down democracy nothing wrong

farmers in our country now get independence in earnings this law would make farmers happy and those opposing dalal procession in punjab haryana not real farmers but they bichaulia sukhbir of badal akali has sukhbir agro comprising most of places doing as bichaulia so they opposing bill and one minister of sukhbir badal party resigned sukhbir earn 5000 crores as bichaulia per year and sharad pawar earned 10000 crores per year by grapes onion
i standwithfarmer and u from west bengal
now i got video which tells me right way about farmer bill and i can make right decision about farmers protest
biggest problem in india illiteracy people really do not understand what they protesting for in plain english this bill out middle man and now farmer can sell their products directly end consumer which earn them more money still they protesting nothing but utter stupidity this my observation modi government will do everything help people if they can understand
any legislation be introduced in parliament after consultation with stake holders in this case farmers were not consulted and didnot farmers into confidence any concern from stake holders must be into consultation before drafting legislation which was not done in this case which wrong in democracy this not radical reform but high handedness of modi govt
there no question on need for laws get rid of unscrupulous middlemen between farmers and consumers how does taking away mandis going help mandis were set up prevent exploitation of farmers in first place how come become breeding ground for middle man
modi politician at end of day thought of doing something in his capacity for farmers and vast majority were happy with but if vocal minority of rich powerful vested interest group with strong pr denting his image worldwide why would care about farmers but when silent majority actually realize what they lost will be too late they missed golden opportunity if they so naive comprehend who their friend and who their foe they better off being left their fate modi will find way win election but
so do not compare these farmers americans
2 who will give monetary helps farmers relatives nearest and dearest who died in this period
we cant trust govt any more bihar farmers now doing dihari in haryanas farm these draconian law
limited selling options one of reason farmers not able excel economically
lot of gray areas undefined in act itself speculations if went as they thought by farmers will result really bad
your caption prime minister announces huge relief farmers inappropriate change your caption made appear as if farmers have been undergoing sufferings due unjustified misdeeds of someone else and prime minister has come forward eradicate sufferings of farmers
very sad doctor and farmers suffering only in this country
proud of being farmer proud of being sardar
only one wrong info inadvertently though mandi tax not paid by farmers but by buyers
people need accept msp subsidies loan waivers tax breaks short term measures not perpetually guaranteed policy they have go away with time once their short term goal met they polices support not bring incompetence today farmers in punjab well of thanks msp but that prosperity cannot be ridden on govt for all times msp policy instrument and cannot be perpetually guaranteed govt policy if done would be economic blunder in long run and for political party will not hurt in short run make msp law just be in power but will create more problems for future of country as whole
big companies will do everything manipulate market prices according their benefits in end small farmers and middle class will suffer
interesting that so called controversial farm bills unopposed by farmers of 27 states
proudly with farmers
congress wanted introduce this bill twice when they were on power
punjabi farmers themselves do not consume this 3rd rate product and actually eat crops produced in up etc
india made of farmers not just punjab all states of india run my hardwork of farmers who give food but please stop hate towards other indians who not from punjab
they killed farmers that farmers burnt vechiles
after disaster of demonisation good because i came from farmer family and i know how bad apmc now in india and corruption and cartilization stole market and farmers get nothing as there middle man in middle man so becomes long chain of middlemen and destroys farmers
goondas won real farmers like ambani and adani will suffer sad day for india
yati baba words turned out be true now in india difficult be hindu in india justice for kishan bharwad
great government who made confrontation of two most important people farmer and soldiers by keeping themselves safe
only one solution khalistan zindabad
modi pls hear voice of farmers
finally pollution in delhi where these 2 states farmers mainly responsible
once in your life need doctor lawyer policeman and preacher but every day three times day need farmer support and respect farmers
but we need educate farmers with this laws
farmers cannot do such things
my theory that bjp govt strategy stretch protest as long as can so that public will feel brunt of protest and revolt against protestors instead of govt
first destroy godi media everything will become normal
its great sorrow that no one care for poor people who feed them farmers protesting for their right which they deserves government playing with them
they not true farmers they very rich and prosperous farmers get msp but marginal and small land holders happy
i have just watched vinod dua sir video about farmers protest and underlined fact that farmers blaming pm for not reacting on their demands so do think his teflon image tarnished bit
i do not support any political party but this not way of handling things bjp gundaraaj chlaa haii but we know kisan or even hum unhii haii
welcome modi ji
modi govt should this farm bill soon
2 lack of crop diversity and supporting industries india surplus producer of stuff like rice and wheat we just produce too much of while we end up importing some other major crops like pulses now somewhat of side effect i can say as government gives msp guarantee on rice and wheat in lot instances which makes artificially more profitable grow than other crops even though should have been other way round where prices on rice and wheat should have gone down if supply too high and discourage farmers grow them and grow something where there demand for or else just waste of food money soil and effort now i do know issue with this as farmers fear leaving stable and safe source for something where they end up making less so i feel government should introduce some sort of floating msp system where msp will be set according demand and supply
why were so many farmers against this i thought cutting out middleman means farmers would have been paid more
we proud farmer
600 millions farmers protest like some number came your mind and just said in flow
farmers being almost half of all workers have lot of power just as long as they can hold out until their demands discussed and hopefully met
i hope people also come forward in support of farmers reject this policy
and they can also buys from farmers directly more price then this msp and why they need law for this or standing parllel mandi
during bihar election campaign where social distance and rule i feel very sad for farmers
media job show news from both angle not show just negative news against farmers
each person pay tax in whole country even farmers too so farmers also have right and what about that time when police dump roads and try stop farmer go delhi when they were going for pueceful protest
thank for supporting farmers
i know farmers concerned but instead of demanding repeal whole act but specific amendments should be carried out which denied by farm leaders therefore farm leaders need be more sensitive this issue
time will answer that this revoke has deeper reasonings and true losers would be farmers who would either live peasent life under mandi traders like tikait or hang trees like always
proud of our farmers hope they win their righteous fight

america cannot be compared because they have alternate employment if we do that and all farmers move lucrative alternate jobs we will have import our foodgrains from outside msp should be guaranteed for marginal farmers first as they donot have enough land care of family for 12 months msp guarantee would increase mrp we need in account as well and ensure inflation does not rise on pretext of increased output cost also middlemens should be totally uprooted from system and profits should go directly in pockets of farmers msp guarantee should run in phases starting with mp up and bihar only punjab farmers already rich then if successful should be moved wb orissa and chattisgarh but priority should be small and marginal farmers
elections coming what power these elections hold they can even make biggest of biggest politicians bow their heads we should have elections every month then india will truly progress maybe online elections
fighting taliban like fighting another country not ordinary terrorist group multinational organisation
bjp will do time pass with rrb ntpc candidates and farmers like before 2022 going be year of protests
central government responsible for all this why they dont care what farmers asking for from 2 months red fort more important than peoples lives how about when they sold red fort wasnt shame at that time every single day one dead body goes punjab from border why government dont feel bad that time

this peaceful protest so let end and give farmers what they want by rolling back these black laws that were implemented without proper consultation and due process
but surprisingly state govt reinforced laws yet there congress party ruling than bjp

fact of matter that pafc on behalf of punjab government already promoting contract farming on large scale bring necessary diversifi cation in state
time hit where hurts boycott ambani boycott jio where sunil mittal should offer special rates all farmers and convert all jio customers airtel

do farmers really watch parliamentary debates does any meaningful discussion ever happen during parliamentary debates opposition would not have agreed even if there were lengthy discussions in end would have come vote in parliament on laws and majority would get their way also by your logic government should consult everyone on income tax defence related laws this way we will never be able pass any law one should either believe in democracy or not once government chosen by majority one must allow them operate rather than blockading cities
great analysis so proved that apmc not working because of its flaws and farmers mostly selling their produce outside mandis below msp in cash transactions new act will mess up incomes of state government hampering development
one of biggest issues pointed out by farmers fact that bills exclude price guarantee mechanism like msp
indian made highway dam hospital consulete etc control by taliban bye bye modi your dream death only left behind afshraf ghani and modi
good job very good r d made by both before making this video providing every details in brief i choose share this video over dhruv rathee or aakash banarjee video because have not only sum up problems related farmers in india but also suggested some solutions in this video
6 01 tear gas was used when mob had started break barricades and march on non permitted around 8 30am 9 00 am rakesh tikait has admitted on camera that protestors wanted start march early but police stopped them so they broke barricades so in my opinion police decision of lathi charge and using tear gas was totally justified
meanwhile indian sellout godi media be like why opposition misleading farmers against supreme commander modi
or 2 those 96 poor farmers who cannot afford sell their product even in their neighbour district
this should have been done sooner but probably easier do so now since taliban showing its cards airstrikes important now against taliban
modi government this decision due elections but there possibility that this will backfire and increase problems for bjp let hope for better
sorry for asking but would not this situation be resolved if government just introduced new minimum price laws for produce of farmers and enforce them that way three farm laws would be acceptable system would rid off middlemen and both farmers and government would get what they want again apologies for my naivete regarding issue just wanting understand situation better
most anti poor and anti farmer prime minister india ever had and would never have
farming very different from other industries as every crop harvested in short span of time every year this creates large gap between demand and suppy hence making free market was curse on everyone thanks that some wisdom prevailed and farmers saved from ruthless hands of corporates need of hour that we work together bring crop diversity and motivate farmers grow crops which imported this will make self reliant and decrease imports
i feel that this reformed agriculture bill proposed by gov needs some changes amendments ensure that our most diligent hardworking farmer brothers get their truly deserving rewards
anyway farmers always have option go apmc mandi if they wish
wow brother this most fact based video i have seen about farmer protest
what wrong with people if farmers have done something like that then they must not be having any other option but atleast this should not be shown on big screen its nothing more than insult and that on such important day
indian government should act strictly against these goons
mr gulati totally confused between corporate farming his analysis totally wrong indian government running agriculture like runs air india
farmer sports party bjp
by way hats up farmers for making democracy alive
8 22 while here said msp will not be provided outside of mandi and so farmers will not be be able benefit with msp

all should do google once know details of farmer suicides across country for decades and root causes and which govts failed utterly
stop producing food for 6 months then they will learn how treat farmers starve this ais officer
time get rid of modi and his bjp
shekhar gupta casually compares alaudin khilji price control msp while at same breath explaining how was maximum price set for soldiers not minimum this approach lacks intellectual rigour can draw baseless comparisons of every economic and social policy with some practice that occurred centuries ago most of indian laws policies and acts based on something or other introduced by british this does not necessarily undermine contemporary relevance of any law or act nor does make particularly special what shekhar gupta should question why centre adamant on implementing these acts even when states have shown that they can easily reform suit their own situation which seems be using as his primary argument
salute every farmer who sitting there nation will remember all of as true nation saviours
very bad decision by modi ji repel this farm laws i am stunned by weakness shown reward such blackmail by such few middlemen and khalisthanis decide fate of majority of farmers and indian industry this decision will pave way for more such blackmail at every step of this govt i just hope and pray that this may not prove in future be written in annuals of history as historic blunder by bjp its senseless harakiri and cowardice shown at time when battle was turning decisively in your favor today i feel sad and i feel like its victory of bad over good today not good day for nation bjp and modiji need course correct as they have invited more troubles now everyday they will holed for ransom by few hundred crooks
allah akbar allah pak rahama show everyone right way insha allah ameen summameen from pakistan love too much taliban because they make muslim government insha allah they will be successful ameen summameen allah akbar i request do other muslim please do not fight with tham should support them for allah pak please think about nicely and do not listen non muslim about that and do not kill each other please do respect each other
courts had already suspended laws for 2 years plus whole opposition was creating so much ruckus about this in parliament and would not let any other reforms pass and about election this protest would have impacted u p elections too and loosing u p not option and security issue that calling crap just imagine if some blast or something would have happened in protests everyone would have turned against modi for not finishing this protest fast enough
where intention double farmer income by 2022 as promised by modi
1 43 whoa i stand for farmers bcs they jsut working
doubt sir even if farmers able sell their produce private players at higher price will not lead increase in prices of food grains and in turn lead inflation
why should police be caught in this trap set by politicians police should stand down let farmers politicians protesting clash with public let public feel brunt public will be upset and action against protestors
but this bill has not mentioned anything about msp providing farmers better market this bill will really help in demolishing middleman
fascist indian government will bow down farmers who real strength of india
pose question if farm bills right or wrong but present facts with such biased inclination that bills seem right which isnt fact
one furture thing missed in this video there link bw pvt players and inflation and soon pvt will become like mandis in all ways loss for farmers
i feel like why still in house i have join this protest not farmer but my heart hinsdustani
banarji sabi am being farmer from south side telling we should be thankful modiji that responded farmers call in withdrawing bill
we stand with farmers
and now farmers from all states across india coming up in support of protest but bhakts will say only punjab and haryana as they congress ruled and this gives them opportunity call them politically motivated
hope all journos on twitter be from any tilted side watch spread information rather than trying infame farmers or slur debase issue
modiji why high earning farmers most of em upper cast still income tax exempt
but farmers still will not give vote bjp that would be real win of farmers
1lakh 50 thousand crore lose in this old agriculture system 2003 this act will announce by congress leader bjp just move this act now this rule very good for our india pls suppport our government

abhijit absolutely wrong if really believes that farm laws were rolled back just for punjab elections then could not be more wrong
modiji did not apologize for farm law said they were unsuccessful convince particular group of farmers hence withdrawing 3 laws as per farmers
stop supporting farmers if rich and can buy food at any price
moreover i thought earlier that this guy tekait with farm laws protest has not much support in up for which modi yogi govt has worry about but now after back i think bjp govt afraid of these people also in up they feared abt tekait that can create big trouble around election day
now all farmers will vote for b j p and appreciate central government
farmers mass of india there needs must be met
ultimately small farmers who will pay for idiotic political farmers
decision of modi quite good oppositions unnecessarily taking vast interest reasons behind this which declared by modiji absolutely correct
secular farmers doing their master congress job shame on these people for spoiling reputation of entire farmer community

violence condemnable movement has lost sanctity and purpose because of violence and anarchy this was not expected from annadatas farmers thev have broken their promise of peaceful protest rioters should be dealt with strictly according law and charged with relevant sections of indian penal code
few more points can also be added such as hoarding by corporates rising of retail prices at wil and wish of corporates corporates will buy at their own rates they may not buy crop produced by poor farmers present day average farmers will loose their livelihood poor farmers will reduce labourers for corporates
whatever happens still bjp and modi will win we have started resemble russia and china

0 58 apmc mandis not perfect but we will not tell why and how
from 3 10 3 40 explains everything that was wrong with new farm laws punjab and haryana richest farming states in india and on other hand have bihar where mandi system was eliminated and new reforms were presented in 2006 and yet they still amongst poorest in india this clearly proves beyond any shadow of doubt that new farm laws will not improve economic conditions of farmers but will definitely improve profitability of few large corporations which close this bjp regime
most probably that 755 dislikes from bjp supporters
support farmers they our life

i am from nabha punjab i will thankful for your support

solidarity with farmers
clearly presented arguments from both sides however last point that our government can in fact regularly does limit free market operations in agriculture by banning imports and exports at expense of indian farmers should not be held against this particular bill fact exists independent of this bill we can only hope that tendency will reduce gradually as only hurts our agriculture industry

stream media must support farmers not govt
some city dwellers know as much about farmers issues as pub g player knows about armed forces very unfortunate supportfarmers
know irony vice use tell about laws that causing distress in their other series but over here they have not even made single explanation i have read 3 new laws that root of problem for them only problem that exists that they cannot get supply and demand of market in right coherence so that farmers can sell their grains in set time before goes rip and this only fault with law also what i think caused this protests not actually actually family farmers taking charge but business official retailers who usually buy from farmer at lower prices and sell made products much higher rate cause if this law passes farmers can sell their crops anywhere and anyone as long as recorded by indian government this caused great protest they do not want money transparency and also i am not bjp cell just indian guy who thought better we sort this in our own country cause every family respects farmers and this age of misinformation just upsets and destroys rational thinking
ground report failed moment called them farmers
farmer food no future
time for govt start chinese style education camps for these khalistani terrorist bastards who pretending be farmers
no that not all that government says ffs they have said they will give in writing that msp will not go anywhere apmcs will be there private players can only deal in crops and not in land or any other property with farmers

going by your own logic india should also should declare itself hindu nation and verbally mention we will care of all minorities like taliban pakistan and bangladesh we all know then how do they care why leftists eyes have closed their eyes on what happened minorities in this countries although they were part of india at some point only difference between india and these countries that islam in majority in these nations if indian muslims really celebrate taliban victory do think their thought process any different why do not blame their dharmik chashma because your chashma does not see

central bjp govt has made life of every indian miserable have not seen one ache din in last 6 years god please save india
this bjp spokesperson anchor junior front of rakesh tikat ji
farmers support this protest but its very far reach and difficult live in that cold weather they not used cold weather due geographical differences locations language another barrier they have never entered delhi far reach capital
farmers protest right because if trading started outside mandi then minimum support price msp will be not there and initially they will get high price but mandi will collapse soon and after mandi collapse since there no msp farmers exploitation will start and big companies traders will purchase in very low cost outside mandi without tax and legal support pressure
wise decision of modi government whatever laws bringing this country but there casualties innocent lives lost wealth of ordinary people lost unrest everywhere why why bcoz unfit for job and if bhakts want him please build temple and worship him we common people of india have no objection let man with heart become pm of this country one may be proud of 56 chest but that empty there no heart of size of ant

and farmers cannot lose their land as under new law land of farmer can neither be sold leased or used for any purpose other than those related agricultural trade activities
farmers have been heavily exploited over there for long time even on certain paper test this cold truth used as material which indicates pesticides and seeds so expensive and they can only afford them by borrowing money from companies who sell pesticides and seeds
never thought megalomaniac like modi will repeal laws but really glad finally did reform required but have consult and work with farmers

jindabadfarmers real heros of our country proud of
real problem even bigger than just taking back these new farm laws thing already existing as said here large amount of trades between farmers and traders across country do not ensure minimum support price putting farmers in never ending debt leading thousands of suicides every year govt needs ensure this too
i think this great for indian democracy i am not expert on farm laws but i leave expert i am only examining functioning of democracy in india imagine since bjp took over for every thing they pass ordinance which means they do not want any discussion at all second president signing every thing and never on single occasion questioned why urgency for ordinance and way parliament sessions conducted even worse speaker chairman does not bring any bill for discussion until last minute and then passing them through voice votes even way finance budget was presented last year was horrible fm does not give any details and asks refer budget addendum for every thing that will be shared after session and after session was all crap with no data definitely current government does not want questions and accountability democracy failing in india and if that continues we will end up way like china
reason for taking back these laws inability convince benefits real farmers or we can say lousy attitude of real farmers let these bogus agitators represent them
still this decision has more advantages and disadvantages mostly based on imaginations that can happen or what if this happens for now will be profitable for farmers
shame on modi government this government taking india 40 years back

5th now govt have agreed give choice states levy tax outside mandis also though not levying tax on agri produce was in favour of farmers and consumers because there also 4 gst which shared by centre and state on food stuffs and ultimately paid by consumer
just one thing has protest solved amything when there was dialogue going on i checked in some other channels many farmers happy because they can sell any people they wantti centre was calling for dialogue then they were supposed meet on dec 3 so could not they wait till then i heard that farmers in many places that farmers especially in punjab very rich they were used all benefit from government now if that true this political gimmick by opposition belief i as citizen want farmer get their die i would rather pay farmer than shop why not make payment in such way that once paid most of goes farmer modi has brought on many changes i have full trust that will come up with something farmers can protest quietly let them wait till 3 rd also they have no right damage property that has people taxes if any thing damage farmers too must pay bill

lesson be learnt farmers movement and caste based reservation two topics which any government should never mess up with if bjp government wants consolidate vote share then make their stand clear on msps and implement

addressing conference of chief secretaries of states dr manmohan singh said there need review and amend agriculture produce marketing act enable farmers bring their products retail outlets and also allow retailers directly purchase from farmers this would bring better remuneration farmers check wastage and allow competitive prices prevail in retail markets
did hindu stop hiring educated people who know difference between two states and several states how can say several states and then follow up by saying punjab and haryana your propaganda getting that lousy your favorite leftist lobbies not paying enough for oropaganda or they themselves getting lousy and cash strapped no not terrorists propagandists i am farmer from karnataka and several farmers from my state from tamil nadu from maharashtra and from every state except punjab and haryana have been committing suicide since green revolution and apmc system with arhatiyas were established as they have benefitted none other than farmers in punjab and haryana my message rich non suicidal farmers and arhatiyas of punjab and haryana sit at home and think of how spend loads of money have earned so far time for from other states make money now outside non functional apmc system
so according mr rathi parliamentary procedures which were legal before 2014 not violation of conduct and undemocratic open market bill much better than monopoly of apmc
punish them clear propagandist farmers will never think about these things
essential supplying farmers good job but when water was not supplied in delhi till 15 days then where had party
some extent procurement policy of fci responsible for lower prices of grains in open market if they could ensure smooth procurement and timely payment of dues farmers market price could have remained marginally above msp fci could then sell excess grain in open market after booking some profit besides this more categories of msp for grain needed in consonance with variety of produce fci may also think of value addition and may itself become supplier corporate fci solely for purpose of pds very bad idea
in long run repeal of these three agricultural bills will lead huge loss farmers day will come when farmers will spit on tikait
if this how lallantop tells story then what can say about rest of godi media shame on lallantop i thought were better than this but disappoint me neither do know real story behind george floyd nor do have guts tell what happened ranjit singh just another shameless channel absolutely nothing draw any parallels between george floyd and ranjit singh concept of freedom and right stand for self protection so alien cowardly people who report like this that they do not understand what stand your ground means people who fought for india freedom were very different from people who running now ranjit singh had nothing wrong and was just standing his ground when was attacked by gunda elements of bjp brought in by law enforcement agencies what did that day absolutely commendable proud of brother ranjit singh honourable society will learn from and and dishonest people will try propagate lies on top of lie malign bravehearts like ranjit singh image once again lallantop big mountain of shame on your face

msp not beneficial for farmer because what happens farmers go mandi then they have given token means they need come after atleast 15 days and also farmers need transportation and sometimes happens that they need money as soon as possible give money labours etc so they sell them at home at low price because they do not have money for transportation
i am also son of farmer but i think that provides more choice farmer where want sell their crops
why cannot farmers form strong associations directly deal with markets both local global rather than dealing with these corporates after all farmers can make contact with overseas across punjab thru world trade leaders cud negotiate with government set up ports nearest states look at other small trading nations
ndtv only showed that very diffcult sell in mandi for small farmers in mandi they have become member pay middle man and all this farmers who have gathered on delhi border no doubt they hardworking but they want earn over these small farmer they growing just wheat and rice which government have necessary buy despite overflowing silos and still our people go sleep without food people always afraid of change
this attempt make by far most unbiased and simplest video on farm bills on internet
no government howsoever brute in majority can afford enact laws that antagonise target group pm modi has realised albeit belatedly apology n appeal by him on farm laws have definitely enhanced his stature as statesman and also underscored his astuteness as leader after all coming elections in up punjab n others necessitated this unprecedented move which in way has undermined majesty of parliament but certainly going be case of once bitten twice shy on part of government any type of reforms will be big no from now onwards upto 2024 half hearted ill baked ordinances legislations have done more damage than good however this rollback will bring more troubles ahead
bro u doing great job its really unfair law for farmers

tikat congress agent his task now defame every person who speaks against raga as mr owaisi exposed impotency of rahul gandhi on several occasions tikat calls mr owaisi as bjp agent perhaps himself congrss pittu his barking will not impact popularly of mr owaisi
i am actually supportive of move reforms can only happen if bjp remains in power and farmers big vote base
1 as farmers education background might not be enough read contracts government can add single contract for all through technology blockchain can be traded like stock shares
means now entire india against bjp and its corporate looters
this mudder of indian democracy by our prime minister modi i fell ahame that i born in india justiceforkissan
potato price 40 45 per kg in villages due essential commodities act but actual farmers getting 5 10 per kg
now farmers will suffer for next 70 years
bjp doing better than congress and india needs
u have earned true fan and subscriber today after exploring protests and farmers heart u guys knows about true point points u raised here very true and nobody was able understood and believe me there so many loopholes in these three bills and nobody talking about them from first day i felt like we need informative channel that can help raise our voice in english bcz global language thanku very much all ur team
why farmers of punjab and haryana in particular protesting
as usual mr modi has turned victory into defeat and then by quirk of fate or planning defeat has again turned into resounding victory farm laws were initially lauded and seemed be sailing smoothly with opposition not able put strong voice of protest then amrinder singh played his hand and used punjab farmers put modi on republic day parade was expected be knockout punch but violence against police and chaos gave initiative back modi tweets by foreign celebs who have no clue about what they talking about has turned this into question of nationalism now smart analyst will be able see similarity of current situation pulawama attack and aftermath farm laws not going go away
ppl r now in favor of modi after farm law news
my eyes were full with tears govt should listen we r farmers and farmers pioneer of country
whether i do not belive that they talk with farmer before implementation of farm laws
intentions were genuinly good for smallfarmers asking forgiveness humbling
most of profit owned by middle men twice or 3x times of which farmer paid
3 private buyer corporates can fix any rate on produce not required buy crops from farmers on msp
maha punjab zindabad politicians ne inlogo ko bant thaa abh pass anne lge this good all state respect each other
if govt and supreme court has come know about harsh reality of role of rakesh tikat what have they done so far does not raises question on working and efficiency of these two bodies
little guy can so much however farmers here have been protesting peacefully for months camped up on freezing streets and this march was also peaceful bar small section that had been lead stray by negative forces within ruling bjp party
we lost 4th generation warfare from antinationals now this will trigger other groups also do same this not right thing do pm modi should have stayed on its stance moreover real and small farmers will suffer and this cycle will go onnnnn
i am very thankful scoop whoop because ones that do not know punjabi can get informed about situation going on in delhi just because of as all other hindi media showing wrong about these farmers thank very much
i am not from farmer background but i can feel pain what they facing talented presentation world class
now i can understand govt did for their own good cause but there misunderstandings and lack of assurance between farmers and govt
wow farmers doing peacefully i can see that
by far best video on farm bills thank
this news not that viral only i see aryan khan was arrested on godi media
this asininely statement that farmers opposition pointless also illogical because farmers aggrieved party which was never consulted before drafting laws does modi government knows better than farmers interests better than farmers themselves modi exploiting majority by churning out laws without much thought and debates everybody knows about demonetisation gst and other half cooked disasters
concurrent entry 33 for trade and commerce in food stuff but farmer produces food grain food stuff as per constitution processed food
farmers right for repealing of laws but patienly listen them those who last thier lives their should be adequately compensated kisan zinabad
they r not farmers they r brokers
only first started attack farmers and now complaint about them this oldest ideas of sangis always blaming protestors who protesting for their rights
i think they need education education of farmers billl
farmers more educated and intelligent than our prime minister and home minister what farmer said all well said
media dont show when these farmers giving food and drinks police they dont show farmers removing police barricades make way for ambulance these channels so biased its disgusting
how many people have read three farm laws who pro or against
10 why farmers did not listen leaders
1st time came through your channel nice explanation every thing there i understand both govt and farmers farmers basically worried for their security
amazing this by far best explanation i have got for farmer bill and one of few videos that i watched without skipping anything thank think school guy for making this video up
i think in essential commodities they will have also include another amendment also add also minimum price that farmer can sell their produce because i feel competition could get so verse that even these guys could buy produce from farmers at cheapest prices later in future that could drag industry rock bottom
law ko repeal nhi karwana chahta modification chahta this law very good for marginalized farmer and bad for big farmer phir bade log jeet chhote log haar
for all people who in support of farm laws congress bjp mili dono congress bjp dono ko chori chori support
easily understand each every point your thoughts on topic at right direction we surplus in whet and rice farmers shift pluses chaana dal ediable oil good for them very informative video thank u sg sir

i have many punjabi friends i mexicans best wishes for your fight in mexico we had same problem but now we have awesome president who cares about farmers corrupt politicians blinded by money
why farmers not allowing bjp do panchayat farmers fault do not blame police n bjp for sake of blaming
1 mentioned farmer cannot sell its produce outside its mandi please revisit your sources that outright incorrect farmers can and do sell their produce outside their mandis now i am not saying farmer from punjab sells in andhra but then what do with that flexibility
i thanks bbc bcz u cover farmer protest in positive way otherwise according godi media we all farmers r terriest
no farmer no food
farmers and get control of their little lands and make and your children enslaved for ever
hosting sikh flag on ramparts if red fort insult jawans who gave there everything for country insult nation constitution insult first prime minister and azad hind fauz only tricolour must be there in its full glory these not farmers but traitors on tractors who deserve jail
previous governments have also not bothered implement reforms infrastructure for farmers
but in this new bill if market price 30rs and in contract price 20rs then also farmers entitled get above market price only despite of having contract they will get better price according market price
this what real punjabiyat feels like mad respect for those protesting farmers
godi midia ko batado ticket sahab bjp jeet hae

supreme court has also expressed its displeasure against these kisans when matter subjudice why creating law and order problems everywhere t
just 0 9 farmers large farmers in india so even if 3 benefit thats huge number just pushing propaganda
vox plzz covere more news about indian farmer protest help indian farmer
sandeep we common people in cities should start bargaining in all supermarkets and chains its really shocking that produce farmers sell at 2 or 3 rupees sold at 30 rupees in supermarkets or shops in cities
farmers from 27 out 29 states happy with this law itll be unfair those states if we remove these farm bills ideally bjp should recommend these law every states explain benefits and let state decide if they want implement law
shows that no one can divide farmers
support farm reform
this government who did announce 2015 at november 8 same super pm modi telling media that devaluation of currency who suffered poor farmers and people in villages so modi said give me ninty days if not i resign but till today his not slow currency problems farmers bill pass with in twenty four hours announce they has parliament also opposition did not listen them because only thing they majority in parliament they did not want know anybody they king
one good thing out of this farm protests govt forced left nri others spend money continue this agitation and made their pockets leaner financial strength of this eco structure was made weaker if bjp totally gives up on farm reforms then will hurt badly modi no quitter first attempt surprising forced farm laws failed waiting for second attempt by modi
indian army will blow taliban
suppose msp becomes legal and no one can buy produce below msp price and msp price of wheat rs 2 015 per quintal and suppose cost of producing 1 quintal of wheat let assume 1600 1800 so in this case farmer getting 400 200 odd rupees per quintal and somehow managing his working capital as well as personal needs one day crop destroyed and quality of crop not up mark that will get 2000 quintal then in case of situation where msp legal nobody going buy his crop and going be in mess whereas if msp not legal there will be someone who going buy his produce on discounted rate and farmer will not be in total loss
yet not cleared why farmers protesting
its for all of u not just for farmer or political party
but for farmers they selling tomato 2 5 per kg

i think problem could have been easily solved if farmers were willing talk on point point basis and did not directly demand total deletion of these bills
this shows victory of khalistan over mootstan
4 share center vision with farmers so they should call in what best for this country
same fate happened australian farmers deregulation of dairy market in 2000s with milk prices small size farms could not make ends meet against big corporations who have dominance on pricing from 88 in victoria state in 1983 with deregulation in 2000s just 33 now as dairy farms collapsed minimum support price also not mentioned in law bills so can turn too horrible for farmers
all indian humens with farmer
this what happens when rats if know who i am talking about enter protest and turn into riot for their own agenda almost every protest has become this those real hard working farmers out there use your pesticides remove those type of people who opportunity do harm more than help through your protest

one rather thinks that key lesson for bjp that ways as important than ends if not more they will get more skilled about there no doubt this 2010 new bjp has right intent mental muscle needed for india prosperity they must will succeed
support maoist and farmers of india
2 farmers can sell their goods anywhere big farmers can benefit from but small farmers any way do not go mandi but governments way get out of farming business and selling private companies means facing ups and downs of market government will not intervene by giving any subsidy or help for procurement
police shoot one farmer shame delhi police
just imagine if all those farmers stop producing food for country
so if look at whole picture america has failed on both fronts failed on political front and pakistan became chinese puppet and failed in battlefield against taliban
farmers will win because they have god blessing
more than half of protesters workers of opposition party almost all belongs punjab state which being governed by congress party
government oversight should not be reduced farming sector must be capitalized this should be balanced death of farmers because of lack of farming education corruption maleficence and no government assistance
i cannot see female farmers feminists where at

while no one can defend demonetization but if talking abt gst thn talks were going abt 2 decades so i do not know wht more consultation were needed and while all thing being said abt how complex or arduous gst being entrepneur nd hav 1st hand experience been lot easier nd lot less cumbersome then previous regime nd also less rate of tax as compare earlier being small business matters lot and talking abt adhaar has actually been big success in stopping leakages nd providing direct benefit who need nd ample research hav been done by agencies and other ngo of its benefits so i do not see how was disaster also while have enumerated d experience of freeing farmers apmc in bihar bt conveniently have not talk abt success in maharashtra so give complete picture so say not always black and white sumtimes grey also in fact most of d time which need 2 b presented as such
protesters apmc business man they not farmars

sir just one question why this same system failed in west had similar system for few decades result only 2 of population left in agriculture and they surviving on huge subsidies bottom line when leave small farmers fend for themselves in trade with corporate they bound suffer govt can have simpler solution of ensuring msp on crops on rotation introduce crop diversity if farmers get price assurance on maize and not on rice in market they wont grow likewise every 2 3 years govt can rotate this will address govt problem of surplus will ensure crop diversification open up innovation in farming and farmers will get assurance that they will not be looted in market

sg your analysis was spot on and has been vindicated today vide modi declaration that farm laws will be withdrawn
modi government wanted improve farmer lives if they do not they would not risk their vote bank
i really like your videos but if i may say this i would have liked more from this video political angle way bills were bulldozed and how there were no prior consultations with farmers perhaps adding why fear of farmers about big corporations and contract farming not unfounded should have been included maybe because these short videos and these complex topics could not get into details but i would have liked more points maybe about how various states which did away with act have fared etc this video really did help me in understanding what laws theoretically aim at or but i think did gross injustice practical aspects and also generalized things little too much but otherwise i really like your videos
never happen in usa same as never happen in india worts raja ever democratic shame in india same work do bjp in india god bless farmers
we pakistani spourt our kisan brother
yet another winning strategy of modiji time will tell

wajha bi farmers lage great work sikho owaisi cong other partis shuld also lern in up punjab elections jao
we know about other nations situation as well so these laws will definitely not work in favour of farmers see what adani did in himachal
taking some highlighted portions from three acts and presenting narrative made good video under 8 minutes but only covers partial facts these 3 farm laws cannot affect msp system which not bound by any legal provisions policy of government and msp has only increased in india over years apmc has legal backing and its passed by state legislators this central law cannot nullify that also if msp guaranteed in apmc why would someone sell out of what percentage of farmers have apmc coverage apmcs does not cover entire state and some states doesnt have apmc acts
finally anti farmers won and true farmers loss shameful

most nonsensical clause that farmer can sell their crop anywhere so small scale punjab haryana farmer who merely has less than 10 acres on average will hire cargo aircrafts and his wheat and rice tamilnadu gujarat
sucide bombing too can not be ruled out by break india brigade always on road with tikait inspired by congress from day one
thanks for wide explanation as far i think these farmers reforms bills will not effect badly on farmers so these protests being carried out by some middle men like commission agents and hijacked by politics and antisocial elements nothing else if someone feels some gray areas of bills can be resolved by peaceful process by central government and farmers i agree with your concerns about 3rd law about special commodity can be further define by taking stringent steps like enactment of law stronger more
abey ravish joota kapada metals fruits wood glass crafts or any other material how transferred from one place another place that industry growing more faster than agriculture and farmer postive jao not fan of any just trying understand what wrong with this bill brokers and govt of state getting upto 8 intrest on farmers production

as maharashtrian farmer i want say this most stupid decision by government here in maharashtra most of farmers do not prefer sell their crops in mandis as price we get there 40 60 lower as compare market price most of sell our goods private merchants or middleman get at least justiciable price mandis helpful only when got no buyers and season coming near end otherwise useless
do not know about implications of these farm laws but if govt do not control price rise of essential goods including diesel and cooking gass future looks bleak for bjp
corporates will give very good rates initially then all farmers will sell only corporates
both bjp and opposition parties killed farmers for political gains
all these years hewas living for his close aides whom has converted them into multibillionaires during these yrs of his rule finished middleclass and almost strangled poor and marginal farmers god great knows his ways

not everything should be seen from perspective of economics such thought process good for western countries especially united states where current liberal economic policies originate from india land of 1billion plus population majority of whom farmers additionally every state has its own manner of farming depending on weather patterns cultural dynamics and set historical patters now when economists such as interviewee try impose their western economic models where agriculture practised in different manner they bound get disappointed in india every state should have own farm laws customized local farming practises we should not always look west for progress but can develop our own model based on our circumstances
godi media channels not showing

momentum girl invite abuse and insult from bjp that will be propeller lk advani resigned when his initial were found jain diary

quite insightful analysis increase in paddy n wheat production even though helped india come out from begging bowl position of 60 has also made her center of diebeticians n bp patients both paddy n wheat with its near nil fibre content floods blood with sugar within half hour of meal consumption so need of hour other than shifting oilseed production in great way also go for higher cultivation of millets with higher fibre content like little millet foxtail millet kodo millet browntop millet etc which not at all water intensive and hence does not need fertilizers n pesticides and which have much more market price

sir such learned person and with whole lot of experience under your belt one of those people who questions government because believe in ideology based on years of learning through experience literature history and not for sake of asking questions but i am very sorry say that your analysis so wrong at so many levels on this what rejoicing at sir victory of kisan netas of selective states who held democracy hostage for approximately 1 year pause and think about this at times these protests became violent and now has overpowered elected representatives of people of this country would staunch believer of democracy and constitution rejoice if our democracy succumbs such protests sir student of indian polity and know very well that even if current government was ethically incorrect and ramrodded bill they still had numbers overpower any opposition by calling joint parliamentary session if say believe in constitution then shouldve denounced whole act of kisaan netas here instead of rejoicing and now when govt who equally responsible for this debacle has pulled plug on these reforms we can all kiss goodbye any agri reform for next 25 years at least and so can 80 poor farmers of this country who couldve become part of free market economics this victory of kisaan netas and dont tell me that didnt know that mr tikait was having his one eye on election all along

will be great if our farmers can be diversified their produce but achieve that one should not bring pass law without proper communication with farmers then ask them that this good for them they should accept these better solution way sg said govt should incentive them educate them so that farmers from their side can able see benefits gradually get shifted those areas also but in no way should be forceful

farmers selling tomatoes onions for 1rs per kg and we purchasing them for 20 rs decide whom this current system profiting and i think free market may help farmers get their fare share of price cause free market cannot have lower price than msp if farmer has choice between apmc and free market and clearly if msp and frp were helping farmers why farmer suffering so much
where those farmers who being exploited and abused and not paid with fair prices why richest farmers of punjab only where those farmers from other states why not farmers from other states protesting ever asked these questions yourself

farm laws real good for farmers but anti bjp politicians and their like minded people created havoc for farmers of india in name of farmers interest destructive forces from outside country and anti national elements added fuel so called farmers movement well loss farmers
minimum support price and maximum retail price changed every year before farming start if supply increase and demand was not there then minimum support price and if supply decrease and demand more than maximum retail price this applicable for all farmer items plus supply increase then do export and never do important and instead of important give highest price farmer
i think bjp shd have implemented farm laws in bjp ruled states and give exemption those states who do not want such laws in that case bjp ruled states will be able prove farm laws good or bad
why only hindi speaking farmers protesting
full support for farmers protest sincerely salute their focus and determination fake bjp govt should be ashamed of their lies and evil biased reforms repeal disputed farm bills and atleast show some remorse really sad and real shame for patriotic indians protest for their rights on our republic day this govt not for people of this nation they meek and care only for power hungry money minded business mafia owners they have no respect for farmers who feed nation nor patriots who give their life for nation at borders

momentum reforms lost just like in 91 no govt will ever touch agriculture for decade or two ones that have come from punjab and rejoicing soon will be faced with dilemma when water beneath their farms runs out almost at critical levels and situation of acute drought forced upon punjab and haryana due excess production of wheat and rice age old tradition of freebies continue one that rejoicing in comment section and saying bjp has lost have lost our future gen has lost all leaders of all parties have enough money live 7 lives abroad lower and middle income group will be left here starve

very beautiful and nice humanity in farmers kisan ekta jindabad
government should listen farmers and give them full support nation rise up because of them
they not just farmers
i am son of farmer myself and believe me this sad day for farmers maybe good for punjab farmers but not good for all other indian farmers
nonviolent agitation all good might not affect general modi support but sg points correctly in no way protest for of farmers against laws should shape of agitation for identity among sikhs of punjab
in india we must must must must need few good leaders who actually support everyone
if every person dislike his debates and his channel definitely wil also back his nonsense words used for farmers
this law not just for punjab or haryana its for all states where required they just thinking about themselves look at maharashtra farmers dying
glad see that whole country standing strong with farmers not only country but whole world also watching and supporting protest modi used remind me of naked king but seems that our eyes now opening

we will continue bring our hope that day not far away when farmers will understand benification of those triple laws till then decision what pm modi took correct
farmers were not alloted place protest was open jail farmers who went there were not allowed come out
farmers protests was peaceful
atleast now other news channel can think of shifting their interest perfect day for reaching all citizens of india support farmers laws cannot be forced specialiy when they significantly wrong let see how long this govt can ignore
this what modi and his parties attitude towards farmers
1 msp minimum support price should not be done away with govt will continue with msp
farmers should have small meetings in villages educate people farmers need msp garntee law on 23 fassals vote chot no vote for bjp bjp will loose state governments indian from uk
support for farmers from alabama usa
sir come up bihar and mp and see reality itself will see most of farmer dont even know how sell at msp up west haryana punjab farmers have larger land and rest have only survival level land
they have decision back but 3 farm law still there chronological samjho up punjab election
bad decision they can leave on states act or use these laws for their farmers instead of repealing all together bad only vad
3 1947 2020 our farmers still in low profile that most of educated people will prefer white color job
not for sikh but for farmers
but if supporter of human rights environmental protection then ought read laws first and see agricultural trends in india and then comment
i think these laws very important for country middlemen must go they reaping benefits of msp not smal and marginal farmers
thankuuuuuu soooo much for understanding problems of our farmers
3 4 bjp workers has also died india best biased channel
regarding msp we cannot compare any electronic or other goods wth agricultural products since dayby day will perish and who will buy any spoiled or perished things rice even produced frm single land will not be of same quality so if there hundred kg seventy will get good price and for remaining price will be lower some times at time of harvesting rain may come or lot of problems which can affect quality and price more than that since india member of wto corporates have choice buy low cost food crops frm other countries and central govt spending billions of rupees every year in agriculture sector through various subsidies and schemes and in newspapers we can check prices of crops daily pls check
1 how will all transactions currently happening in apmc give msp farmer
all parties know problems yet not ready accept reality know that even changing law may not help calling themselves as well wishers of farmers please stop politics think and talk straight please give farmers best price let economy grow let farmers become comfortable
so far 150 farmers died during protest by severe cold and still dictator being indifferent about

best cm yogi ji
plz sir explain why only farming product price same for very long time
rakesh congress chala
asaduddin awaisi clearly said that against taliban terrorists do not misleading people show full clips
now tell me one thing let example of bihar where apmc has been abolished in 2006 but if see income growth of bihar farmers 0 8 so not clear this bill will not do any magic as such alone
and no government has even able significantly create jobs where farming community can be weaned out of farming which becoming more more poorer as 86 5 of farmers have less than 1 5 acre of land and this holding continuously reducing can see exodus of farmers abroad from punjab where this major reason although some bigger farmers also emigrate due quality of life abroad however majority emigrate as farming not viable and there no suitable white collar jobs available elsewhere
lakhimpur case nightmare for all farmers and indians arnab discuss on this do not shout discuss no one like burn fellow indians your wrong notion
i am punjabi and stand with farmers
never support these three bill
should have given little focus on states who already have this new system implemented for long time for e g bihar has there any improvement in state of farmers of bihar no
this protest and blocking of laws may be harming india in big way but definitely helping bjp politically opposition parties digging their own grave and going in deeper and deeper
but when indian govt tries copy paste same laws here all international media starts crying for farmers why did not they support their farmers from their countries
laws on paper by and large good with few exceptions like not mentioning msp on paper or no access courts but benefits of this level of privatisation usually limited those who already well established and have capacity advantage of benefits poor farmers may not be able do so given high level of poverty in country especially in rural areas we cannot completely do away with government support
maashaallah if farmers can make their own godown and sell will be revolutionary movement historical move in agricultural sector allah make easy for all farmers inshaallah aameen
farmers have been committing suicide in india since 1990s what govt doing help them and why did not govt talk farmers before passing farm bills india democracy anymore

who giving these so called poor farmers money for protesting since last 10 months
big farmers of punjab and haryana who sell at msp fci in these mandis thinking and forced think by politicians that in future govt may stop procuring at msp but ordinance does not say this at all of wheat and rice and if prices fluctuates on lower side then they may loose because then they have sell private traders but why not other farmers of india protesting answer msp announced for all over india for 25 crops but since 1965 when fci got established fci has procured only wheat and rice and mainly from these two states punjab and haryana and certain level from mp rajasthan chattisgarh also but mostly punjab and haryana farmers traders commission agents govt has benefitted till now and who has lost 135 crore indians all other state farmers

disappointed by incorrect cooverage of farms protests modi govt trying setup parallel system for crop procurement slowly and gradually they will eliminate msp then how will ensure that kissans get right price for their crops moreover small farmers do not have money or resources fight big companies in court in case of contract violations in that case mist of them will end of losing their lifetime savings if company rejected their crops based on quality issues
why only punjab farmers why not farmers in south india and other states protesting this looks all politically motivated
state government should provide msp mpp min purchase price for all crops grown in their region or they should list out minimum purchase price for crops from farmers for contractual farming all crops regardless of their growing size should have fixed msp mpp price detailed out every year by local state government when there agricultural ministry in place and people sitting there work for benefit of country i am sure they surely can come out with what fair price for each crop in every season depending upon market and region i am still not sure what prevents govt in deciding msps let say they not in position provide msp mpp right away this year due lack of infrastructure storage then they should obviously be compelled build such infrastructure at rate that they can confirm msp would be applicable from that date onwards and so would be laws
now for each one of patriots of india stand with pm narendra modi in this hour where fighting 2 5 war rather than going ballistic against him and defeat his efforts in neutralizing 0 5 war with enemy within including lobby judges occupying sizeable seats in supreme court
zee news abp news godi media shame on

many of reforms during 90s like industrial licensing were passed in hurry and not much attention reason they had back bcoz state elections not synchronized with national election no reforms will work unless fixed also fact that few states can decide fate of all other people in india just bcoz they will vote in next few months dangerous than dictatorship

zee news staffs good actors beghairat media
absolutely misguiding example given that out of auctioned price of rupees 100 farmers gets only 10 in apmc grossly wrong middleman i e commision agent paid only commission and other service charges essentially there no middleman between trader and farmer in apmc traders being small and many there no cartelization whereas as per new bill will be monopoly on burning issue every tom dick and harry starts opinioatating even if has no first hand knowledge of subject this man did exactly same
twitter sabko hashtag chalana farmers

farmers protest started with great intent and be honest they have got lot improved through discussions with government msp guaranteed along with other demands that were put in as check not let corporate overlords advantage of vulnerable farmers
point out at least one farmer in this fish market
farmers asking for govt help which called regulation which govt can not provide for sake of corporates
said that punjab and haryana farmers avail whole msp of country because they rich no sir reason because in punjab nd haryana have well defined network comparing other state and they produce mostly rice and wheat
bjp isnow so good at ignoring problems in country that they do not even see farmers walking on street
its same with pashtuns when we fight and die on indian borders and in other conflicts we not terrorists but when we ask for our own rights we then automatically labelled terrorists
more power our farmers
also request cover why farmer laws passed as ordnance when ordnance required
no chance for celebrations now opposition parties have get answers for their vehement opposition farm laws silent majority farmers who were busy in their farms could not manage come on roads in support of farm laws this master stroke by modi sir still not understood by rahul and likes of him
2 flag not khalistan flag sikh community flag just like muslims flag green color with moon and star which similar pakistan flag but cannot say they pakistani that shows your
apmc there as ever but if they were that much solving problems why farmers were doing suicides
no details what new agricultural laws anything hide they would not riot without reason i resonate with farmers i know when they do that they have valid reason otherwise they have no time for that
therefore in my view this agitation will not be called off on one pretext or other till coming elections in five states over however bjp supporters who had become hostile due this agitation may be back though in lesser numbers
each farmer has strength of lifting 2 policemen each hand still they maintaining peace thats meturity
whoever questioned farmers today in this pc on teni resignation demand hats off him for possession of audacity ask question which can corner both skm government

farmers really hardworking very strong and powerful i hope they bring change
i really liked your explanation of farm bills and execution that will happen as consequence but i do not agree with your solution prevent exploitation instead of controlling market like in soviet or ashokan model government should enable more competition and support creative destruction of existing companies or within companies steps can be promotion of start ups in this sectors enabling infra required grow ease of finance etc
captain one who started farmer agitation and has won modi has no face now fir 2024
only 6 percent of farmers avail of procurement facility of govt under msp and most of other farmers trade with local small scale traders with their price fluctuating hence making msp mandatory will send those small scale traders jail that fear in those traders will adversely effect farmers since they wont find much buyers so legalising msp redundant and also disadvantageous farmers
farmers simply asking for assurance that msp will continue and that they will get electricity subsidies
trevor i am glad u brought that up but just try think ur country too have these law like rest of world in india farmers works on very small lands that why govt made these laws as option old system there stay which u did not mentioned red fort incident khalistan movement which u did not mentioned there some problems with law which can be sorted out now u know something

another argument that contract farming will benefit farmers because they will get assured price pre written in contract they say that this will give them better price such as at least cover their input costs some economists suggest that laws will empower farmers into commanding position where they would be able dictate their own terms and prices if that really so then why does not government jump in and write msp

why people so toxic until now they criticized govt for not withdrawing farmlaws now they criticizing again citing this as election stunt guys come on bjp cannot win punjab elections anyhow
farmers given full freedom sell their products any one of their choice
yes farmers in bihar sell their produce at prices much below msp no wonder miserable condition of farmers there
godi who does not know how save economy or nation knows what good for farmers and farmers doesnot know what good for them
meghnad has been quite fair proposed laws contract farming itself had been recommended by ms swaminathan point that since some of these reforms have already been tried out and did not work out as expected coz know world not ideal doubts regarding their implementation and discussion of steps with stakeholders required correct them pending way govt went about this so undemocratic and farmers clearly unconvinced problem with this last i checked india not authoritarian state as per its constitution remember folks bold does not necessarily equate wise
respect private sector adore millionaires and billionaires cheer for job creators they creating livelihood for millions of indians

third point private players will invest money in farm land and then recover them by accepting produce and compensating farmers every private player well aware of dynamic demand and they have supply chain competencies for same so if farmer has extra produce then will be by corporates
farmers hiting them good but then police cannot do anything these fraud anndata these not farmers they goons

farmers have been used by all political parties
i would lije if read 3 farm laws 1st cause what said literally opposite of whole thing

now punjab need freedom india
sir according me in essential commodity act was enacted when there was shortage of food in india now we have abundant of food n eventually this also get wasted due fact that every farmer release their crop in same time this lead lower prize and wastage of food and now they can store crop and wait for gud time for prize come up

they will exploit farmers for sure in simple words govt want step back from its responsibility for msp if not then they should have mentioned msp for farmers outside mandis as well

if government giving legislative backing msp should be done by keeping in view all kinds of farmers not just those from haryana and punjab who can come delhi and create cvil disorder not person from kerala growing cashew and rubber farmer
90 of people in this interview delhi people appeared understood farmer issue and they were supportive of farmers very happy see fellow delhiites concerned for farmers just do not understand howcome these same delhiites voted for same bjp and modi into power from delhi maybe modi did vote rigging
there solution scenario b tho if govt sees that farmers begun get less price in long term govt and just make simple adjustment and and make msp for private market too
please let everyone know reality we support farmers
words of this feku cannot be trusted unless demands of farmers implemented

reason they lost this battle because they stared riots with anti hindu slogans if they stick farmers slogan all indians would support them
what will happen if p modi does not find place in media for even one day imagine

foundation of 2022 punjab elections
withdral of farmers bill not good decession of gov t
ok we assume modi ji sant maharajah how about some new person sits in pm chair and mortgage 50 of agriculture community few big corporations
government should not yield such arm twisting tactics by this miniscule minority of indian population farmers over pampered with various concessions and subsidies giving back very little consumers
zee news trying his best show farmers as criminals
now lost case for modi if goes back and withdraw will hurt his ego if does not do so will loose people mandate very likely will do same error of judgment about farming communities and emotion attached farmers of people at large
before 2014 election we will change minimum support price there will be new formulathe entire cost of production and 50 profit will not only help farmers but this step will also not allow anyone loot farmers modiji
either farming regulated or not one and only getting screwed farmers if government intervenes special interests thrive through selective licensing if free market capitalist succeed and monopolize market either or lose lose situation for both farmers and consumers only option have choosing between lesser evil
they ignored initial smoke coming from punjab and paid price
brother these farmers only from one part of of country those who refused even read bill bill for benifits of farmers but other political parties in county brain washed them and provoked them for protest i would like if read bill once many parts of country happy with bill because they understand bill and know advantages of bill please do more research before making video on any political cultural historical or religious matter anyway your comedy videos awesome i love them

very nicely explained hope we may see another amendment on msp kudos all farmers
never forget 700 farmers that gave their lives for this win whaguru
section with reason why farmers protesting absolutely right but truth about middlemen in apmc totally wrong example of onion wrong in apmc no one can purchase crops below msp so false say that middlemen buys onion at 10rs and sells at 100 middlemen nevers buys anything fci that buys crops from farmers with help of those middlemen commission agents so way modi govt says bicholiye hta jayenge gives feeling of good intentions people not connected farming but those connected farming know truth
100 correct analysis any good decision benefit farmers welcome
issue with farmers from specific states and they have right protest when quote about farmers suicides but then miss point that none of farmers from those states have been protesting this seems biased person that got killed was due him ramming his tractor into barricades neither mention specific reason people have been arrested and also fail mention that there were 8 rounds of negotiation and proposal stall law for 1 5 years if i am not wrong make changes and negotiate hope did your homework bit more lot of indians pissed off with external media coz they do not understand specifics nor care about and peddle their own ideology
modi ji has failed once again on farmers and sikkim village of india occupied by chinese pla
no need of celebration modi will bring laws and implementation from backdoor otherwise why they waited till 600 farmer death
interesting see how all parties will react in debate when bill will be discussed in parliament generally all opposition behave against bill presented by government will they do here and how government will argue in favor of bill can there be game in parliament when opposition votes against bill and bjp do not vote or vote for nota if available

1 more than 70 of wheat and paddy produce in punjab haryana procured under msp and they saying 6 on all india basis which wrong as other farmers not having marketable surplus 10 crore out of 14 6 crore farmers have land holding less than 1 ha and major area under rained 2 punjab haryana rajasthan only state which engage ardthiyas commission agent in procurement and in other states like mp which contributes equal punjab in central pool procures through primary agril credit societys gram sahkari sewa samiti ardthiyas have earned more than rs 800 crore in wheat procurent only in punjab haryana why procurement happening through mandies as pacs capable which farmers body skm not demanding this as procurement centre will near farmer and scheduling of arrival can be monitored pacs will make profit and more services like storage grading processing etc can be set up at pacs level happening in other states like mp chhatisgarh odisha telangana and up has also started 3 msp be made as base price for auction in mandies so govt need not procure and farmers free sell outside mandies as per new act skm not demanding that msp be made as base price for auction skm just saying msp guarantee which creating confusion so demand should be specific 4 skm leaders creating confusion that how small farmer will sell produce of 1 or 2 qtl in bangalore or chennai in this connection central govt has target of 10000 farmers producers organisation fpos means one fpo block which will aggregate farm produce and will negotiate with traders these fpos will be managed by farmers themselves by hiring professionals and central govt giving more than 25 lakh fpo as grant fpo most efficient marketing channel and local rural youth can be motivated and guided properly ardthiyas commission agent should not be member of fpos visit sfac nabard ncdc website in addition fpos rural youth can form their rural cooperatives 15 20 rural youth or may be rural youth of entire village of marketing which may set up private market yards or e trading centre these rural cooperatives will get their service charge or can set up their processing unit and can have tie up with retailers like reliance dress big bazar or can open their marketing outlet in nearby city moong will be produced by farmers and will be procured by local rural cooperative which can set up their pulse unit also and govt schemes available 5 75 of 305 million tonne foodgrains cereals pulses as oilseeds not part of foodgrains consists of wheat and paddy 235 million tonnes which means coarse cereals like bajra maize zowar ragi mundua etc and pulses have production of only 70 mt of which small proportion of farmers have marketable surplus but we import pulses so farmers of punjab haryana and western up should go for diversification of crops as water table and soil fertility also issue in these areas 6 some commodities like bajra maize jowar mandua ragi should be included in pds by respective state govt so that procurement from farmers will happen at local level karanataka govt has included ragi in pds system skm not having this demand bcoz will affect procurement of wheat paddy in punjab haryana as maximum kisan morcha leaders from these states 7 43 large farmers 10ha and 22 medium farmers 4 ha of country from western rajasthan and we can easily understand their level of production skm not aware about definition of farmers so we can understand their level of awareness about farmers problems they just befooling entire country 8 more than 7 crore farmers have land holding less than 0 5 ha and pm samman nidhi of rs 6000 big help them govt giving samman all farmers otherwise could have saved more than 30000 cr

i do not support this decision but i am sure this certainly ring bell in chinese people in prc where their leader never apologized them inspite of commiting so many attrocities and hardships although ccp will react this in their usually way with overdoze of hubris saying this beginning of fall of modi india etc etc
poor farmers helpless even govt helpless before broker mafias there will be end all mafias

farmers cannot hold govt hostage their demands
explained very succinctly i agree with assessment that these bills need be tweaked particularly in view of experience of american farming communities who have not only faced adverse issues of corporatisation of agriculture but also tremendous harassment and exploitation from companies selling farm equipment
further shree narendra modiji showing his administrative skills when was chief minister of gujarat in 2002 when godhra riots took place and pogrom in nadora patiya occurred in february 2002 when mla of nadora dr maya kodnani rss protege was at helm of affairs and senior bajrang dal leader and his associates were involved in genocide carnage arson and looting and were convicted of heinous crimes against society

international media should too raise concern of farmers of india
when modi was just 11 years old indian army liberated goa and french ruled pondicherry became part of india as union territory
bjp now repealing farm laws masterstroke
those farmers didnt even read farm laws
fun fact they not 100 farmer
laws were not benefiting anyone for they were not in force bjp was being unable make inroads into protests which had turned sihk vs bjp protests punjab and sikh community was getting alienated day by day there was no assurance if laws would be ever in force all in all entire situation was breeding only negatives for ind and there was absolutely no positives add that all organisations and individuals who were in support of laws they had passed entire buck goi and goi was visibly struggling under load
our village farmers busy in harvesting their crops and some ready for next season these persons cannot be farmers
please explain i am humbly asking i learnt that punjab cm passed ordinance against these very new farm laws which means that these new farm laws will not be applicable in state if punjab if not applicable in punjab then why fear there
i was in favour of these new farm laws but this has convinced me that bjp only believes in winning elections after destroying economy seemed like good step but govt just could not understand magnitude of protest and use of force against farmers was another step in wrong direction pm could have held direct one one conversation with farmers at outset and things could have been different
really think modiji weak because repelled just for election
justice in favor of farmers govt immediately should repeal all agri farm laws and work for farmers and common people in country and not work for ambanis and adanis
farmers just saying kale kanoon and modi bad if same law would be brought by any other party everyone would be happy there some flaws and they can be amended as govt open amendments
hardwork not money lending farming on field off field different but rich middlefarmers so called adhtiyas want avoid taxes e g as agri income related
of course farmers had be perfect in food prep loved langar system more power
now that for theory however on realistic level what produce does company hope secure by offering 500 for something standardized at 2000 do they plan disrupt their model and go out of business without raw product so this 75 price reduction seems far fetched ultimately demand and supply forces balance things if companies offer 1500 and less farmers contract for that price leading less supply demand rises and players emerge offer more than 2000 now company offering 1500 finds itself in touch spot now with lost reliability and fewer contracts
talk farmers and their kids before making such video dont believe in lies of these economic and leaders as they personally dont do there things and just build up talks
tyrant government who not allowing farmers reach national capital delhi and farmers waiting way long for government permission go ramlila maidan and jantar mantar designated place for peaceful protest
sg i think media has failed in its duty as fourth estate media should have communicated benefits of farms laws instead was more interested in presenting showdown between farmers and government
atleast farmers should have learnt or read life of bhagat singh
get well soon modi ji
modi ji will never repeal caa nrc law because muslim not core voter of bjp
last ppint although i do not know how but enviro farming needed and country should be sectorized into different groups where mandis only offer msp on products that natural area
3 godhi media continues hate rhetoric with ajj tv anchor says go pakistan if modi not your prime minister
farm bills will help farmers consumers
bill forced through ordinance ripe with mistakes and amendments country divided like never before on religion caste etc all sectors hurt covid handling amongst worst in country fuel prices at all time high electric meters forced on farmers without pay increase and shekhar gupta giving intelligence on why these hastily approved farm bills good farmers being called all sorts of names in orchestrated propaganda but farm bills good matlab kisaan ko maar do ambani looks on hungry at farmers lands but farm bills good because some intellectuals said so just like demonetization was good and required i suppose this talk seems like poor sick person being told hospital bill high but gotta pay up before getting treatment because hospital needs renovation and above all apparently farmers do not understand anything logical kaisey lag audience ko
this shameless anchor was trying too hard prove black laws right farmers terrorists for past 1 year now frustrated truth wins started on auspicious guru nanak devjis gurpurab farmers have saved democracy
but for truth fact many farmers oppose and many farmers support also whom should impress
modi media
total failure of bjp government first they have allowed shaheen bagh happen and now these fake farmer protests despite unfortunate events of 26th january
world war 2 was not fought in 1955 also european model failed in protecting farmers from corporates and their suicide rates going up
states had different rules regulations buy food grains from farmers was difficult for corporates handle so many states with so many different regulations taxes but now they need not worry about any state
gdp p modiji agriculture sector ne bacha rkhi covid time
instead they should bring reforms local apmc mandis remove all useless taxes regulate commission agents they should get commission only when they get good value farmers for their crops make everything in apmc cashless why local taxes being levied when exempted from gst
remove this law why too much ego in front farmers where agricultural minister only modi and amit shah handling all ministry in this modi government no role for other ministers only 2 voice in this party others just like dummy ministers why much democracy inside bjp party
god bless farmers let not people starve before government change its ways god give them better plan which benefits all people
all farmers brothers and sisters deserve so much praise and support
how can democracy with elected parliament system have referendum system on farm laws even if we have one that likely be held by vested interest driven by rich farmers here clearly evident that for benefit of 2 lakh farmers who had money and power suppressed 10 crore farmers if this what wanted publish then layman on road could have told me this why do we need experienced journalist and editor for job villager does not know about democracy can argue like what did now understand nuances when publish content please in mind that there certain expectation from senior journalist when publish opinion
will impact on pds govt will buy from private players for food distribution lower class will be impacted and price of commodity will be manupliated
indian pm modi like deaf in farmers agitation issue
for apmc mandi point farmer will have many options sell just like any other manufacturer of any goods
we provided free corona vaccine many countries but global media giant do not have dare show positive side of india bitter but truth
if laws repealed modi govt will learn its lesson that indian constitution and india federal structure cannot be kicked out of window we not open fascism and anarchy and single party system and dictatorship not necessarily in that order
lastly govt failure of not able assure or pursuade our farmer brothers and have been left their fate in this chilling winter of delhi

class apart print at with any other international media house i hope this gets into heads of bjp supporters get into political negotiations instead of this dangerous game of national unity
relation between sikh flag and farmer
i talked many farmers in locality many said adani and ambani will there land no other points were valid arguments from them now i do not understand how will adani and ambani will there land bill itself says renting purchasing or lease of farm land strictly prohibited better not opt for contract farming if they really think adani ambani will there land
aakhir bjp election cheeje utar not happy with pm

10 15 kangana has been hounded and trolled and deserves for her comments but that comedian veer dass came close her gutter level comments with his blanket generalization and gross misrepresentation one may support any party or ideology but his comments were appalling and devoid of basic decorum
hate modi for bringing farm laws and caa i hate modi ji because did not enforce those laws
because when tamil nadu farmers protects no one supported now they asking others support
credit of high income of punjab and haryana not because of efficiency of current structure that because of concentration of centre aid farmers in these two states and bihar on other hand hand has very small land holdings small and marginal farmers vulnerable in punjab and haryana also only middle man benefit from existing system and they acting as pressure group stop reforms
i salute brave heart farmers stand against such dictator government very very egoistic prime minister india have right now i hope people will understand and bring back democracy
india currently 4 agricultural prooduts supplier for world if new farm reforms implemented farmers will have full freedom sell indian big companies producticity increases diversification increases this means america and china will see drop in supply of their agricultural products as these indian companies start selling abroad making india 1 agricultural exporter

well if under ncp govt or sharad pawar all middleman business or agriculture mandi been headed by ncp congress leaders and most of money generated here were cash and were in small in amount like rs 10 80 which nobody bothers much but this small amount becomes big fund raising when gets in number multiplication and secondly daily essential food products which daily consumed so just understand amount of black money this sector generates hence this source of black money generated by political parties mentioned
pafc following tripartite agreement between farmer pafc and companies providing seeds extension services and buy back guarantees farmers

why shri modiji now quiet should strong action jay hind
finally geniune report about farmers protest thanks vice news
now corporates can store grains for as long as they want because new bills also exclude grains and rice from essential commodities act which stopped them from doing so now corporates will control market price they can grains for as long as they want and as much as they want maybe market low and price for grains less so corporates will stop supply and according very theorem of economics less supply more demand so more rates of these essential commodities moreover these government will buy less grains from now onwards so food which was earlier rationed also going eventually stop
i was happy hear this this big for farmers over government kangana and godi media all there mouth shut farmers stand against like warriors

this situation of apprehensive created by other political parties in innocent farmer mind
that abject surrender and shameful did not expect this from modi india not just punjab and haryana india has no future
indian farmers created history
so country with 1 3b population with majority of being agricultural background should go for building warehouses or invest money on industries which feed roughly 1000 of family if farmers numbers gets down food production gets decreased then middle class people itself will find daily food expenses costlier then think of poor happy living with shelter food and education more important than being economically developed country
wrong decision by indian govt repeal laws laws were put in place for farmers benefit farmers would have understood value in future opposition laws almost died then why this decision this will only strengthen anti national forces fight against everything that benefits country
congress gi rss bjp
economists argue that farmer can sell his produce anywhere in india but possible for farmer ferry his produce from state state in hope of better price i think economists more obsessed with flip kart and amazon like platforms but that does not work for perishable goods
modi where india dad
1 there no such safety net decided by fci during procurement of foodgrains fci purchases all arrived stock in mandi from farmers through comission agents and past two years fci strictly ensure every single payment of foodgrains concerned farmers by bank statement of comission agents this marketing season fci have developed mechanism of directly payment farmers which brings more transparency
bjp and congress both have expressed issues with apmc mandi having lots of issues kerala n many other states do not use mandi rice grower of kerala not protesting projected roles of adatiya being glorified by this lady why this protest since large growers of wheat do not know tax payer money of 33000 crores which was coming states what will happen govt has been buying wheat its reaching pds shops apmc and not that all goods sold class in fact pds ration shop wheat not palatable by common man this means good grower of wheat lets say 100 quintals in reality selling 200 quintals in apmc out of which 100 stones and not real wheat then money related this wheat goes middlemen and farmers ashirvad atta company or similar ones do not buy this wheat when farmer dumps his wheat in apmc mandi who finally buys from there and where does wheat gets utilised has real answers for this protest why does govt still imports despite bumper crop or farmer does not export if has done excellent quality and has fear of price drop few questions based on fears these away from reality on ground news channel should visit apmc ware houses and show pictures of rats and rotten wheat laying lack of disposal in time and usage that will clear all muck channels not spending time show real ware house conditions
i have watched your old videos where u were appreciating modi for these farm laws and now u cursing him

i am from tamilnadu i like this video quite useful after celebrating 72 years republic day still farmers in my state very poor and facing lots of troubles like cyclone floods insufficient water storage etc state and central government will never provide enough money or cancel loans for affected farmers as so many years passed away so my opinion central government tried their best and let them do their work hope may be successful for farmers in future whole problem for small and poor farmers let their children will help them in condition apply legal process after all they working in field for foreign company
in my opinion bigger question that should be asked why farmers still poor even after 73 years of independence why they not rich like american or european farmers
i am with farmers

vox knows more about farmers protest then british prime minister
this not way beat themto blood atleast old farmers
1 scale according report almost 87 of farmers in india small and marginalised farmers who work on less than 2 hectares of land means small farmers because of their scale have buy inputs like seeds fertilisers etc at retail prices small scale leads higher cost of transportation proportion crops these farmers mostly do not have means store them themselves so they mostly have sell them immediately in market and considering transportation they mostly have sell them at their village itself and also considering almost all other farmers in village might be doing same thing so basically floods market and well demand and supply comes into play making them receive less income and on top of that less bargaining power leads easier exploitation of them by middle man now mandi system makes last part of selling bit more safe with government oversight make sure at least they get somewhat of fair price but again does not solve entire issue
no farmers protests so
there too many people here who have forgotten that our enemies pakistan china and khalistanis whether farm laws good or not secondary what matters more that we well equipped deal with external threats we faced with calling sikh farmers carrying indian flags khalistanis and driving cars on them not just reprehensible but dangerous country think about how demoralizing sikh soldiers who have guarded our borders for centuries your lack of respect and gratitude bizarre and shameful please change your ways and stop fighting with fellow indians this just not time

organic farming cannot sustain populations of today slow and fragile way of farming srilanka implemented strict organic farming and crisis has erupted there as first lady said we should let anyone come and buy from apmc without license so that what this new laws will allow just because capitalist system has flaws we cannot replace with total state control as leads hegemony and for god sake stop worshipping organic farming as its impotent fill our mouths which have increased exponentially
but why protest against three bills mentioned in first place as they clearly mitigating some of existing problems of farmers
should have added that option of selling fci directly citizens at markets and mandis at msp remains open framer so what farmers demanding as legal msp already exists and will continue exist fci has very very important part play
apmc yards still functional according these bills farmers can choose either apmc yards or private buyer and farmers have also changed they might not get trapped by private parties farmers can select short term agreements with private buyers like say 1 crop 2 crops 3 crops many governments tried removing apmc yards because there high corruption involved there approx 1 of total turnover made by food processing units like eg rice miller wheat miller dal miller etc being paid apmcs as commission for trading products

this one of weaknesses of democracy these laws were step in right direction but they repealed them gain votes because people do not understand economics if want india become competitive and develop need free markets and free trade
point which i really liked that today farmers price takers but by this new reform they going be price makers
because they have no idea about modern farming techniques and they took money from political rivals of bjp as congress kutti party and tuchhi party
do not worry this strategy find out people in nvilved in khalistan from inside india now they tracked try understand depth
nevertheless farmers have genuine fear about any government attitude irrespective of party affiliation in respect of msp this based on their past historical experience
farmers have no time protest
whole of india living today because of farmer and army green revolution was done at punjab and haryana land in 1960 because that there was famine in india we both states stand with whole india now everyone eat rice vegetables in food live life so now i want ask question from every citizens of india why dont rising voice in front of government why closing your mouth punjab or haryana stand with india from mughal east india company period we gave 92 sacrifices in indian freedom why today be silent other states people or national media
farmers forgot that roads meant for vehicles and not for protest

another jumla of modi govt no doubling of farmers income will only double when swaminathan commission reports implemented and msp legalised today around 90 percent crop produces sold in open markets private players much less than msp only corporates income doubled
arrogance of power let down fall of many empire hope bjp will become current congress
i request india drop your obsession with taliban there many other worst states in world like israel north korea myanmar who as worst as taliban but since world has accepted taliban too will be accepted we could do nothing all options failed
farmers were concerned in future mandis will be removed see our farmers can think of future how intelligent they r but wait they cant think what will happen water level and soil in future so remember these r not farmers
sir very good but kindly brief that why this govt in so hurry that these bills have pass without any debate and afraiding face questions from farmers secondly word msp not being added in these bills who will deal with contracting farming means only specialist or big players in this industry want control on whole farming sector as they know very well that this sector has wide scope earn please also advise that these bills should be openly debated in public and after finalise conclusion these bill may be brought up
unnecessary agitation by farmers when farm bill already postponed for 2 years by court and bills in favour of farmers only
taliban proved be strongest military group in history they defeated whole united world powers they have reminded fatah makkah and victory of baitul muqadas by sultan salahuddin
agricultural reforms not necessary farmers

we should never ever mess with punjab or bengal coz these states which helped gain independence and these states which helped remove indira so now bjp has messed with one and if they mess with other then govt will no longer be there
thank mrs priyanka for your support farmers god bless
bjp representative was weak in her arguments had no answers but also didnt want accept facts as they so swiftly manuvered towards blaming congress this has become very convenient for bjp lately hadnt answered one question raised by rajdeep also was being opportunistic and looked for any factual mistakes made by ancor question his credentials question her very opportunistic and arrogant say least i believe bjp can have and do have better spokepersons and should stance on subject at hand
congratulations all farmers god bless always
only con which i can see farmers generally rotate crops soil fertile but if price for certain crop lucrative then farmers may repeatedly go for same crop which can damage soil in long run
1 need define regulated framework where government will oversee monitor contract farming deal presented by private entity avoid any exploitation farmers

currently apmc decide market rate of goods produced and isnt amazing that even in 2020 there no free trade allowed in farming sector stop this bullshit of something might wrong happen apmcs and msp will be there if farmers dont want sell their good private sector in current scenario msp means maximum support price because farmers not allowed sell anywhere else but apmc unless there alternate buyers how can minimum supportive price be effective its like monopoly apmc also charge around 10 tax farmers 2 n 8 goes govt thats why these middle man protesting not actual farmers so please stop spewing shit
totally concocted stories from everywhere absolute disregard for farmers politics only opposition has no clue on how oppose popular govt
if farmers do not want improve their life then left them stay poor
i can assure 90 of our population has absolutely no idea about any of including majority of farmers they either supporting or opposing based on their political preferences lol
if very important like pm says in this speech then i would like ask why repeal this law though know this law good for farmer then what make him repeal this law willingly away goodness of farmer law what force do that
p correct about farm bill that was many time discussed with their corporate friends and then brought in parliament for enactment
why did exclude fact that msp not legal provision also was promised in election manifesto that would repeal agricultural produce market committees act and make trade in agricultural produce including export and inter state trade free from all restrictions why then we raising barriers when in principle all of agree good for farmers apmc not going anywhere either so everyone has option sell there
do really think our real farmers do this does everyone fools they insulting our indian farmers

moreover if government feels that farmers misguided they should have approached them way before rather than using water cannons and forces against them also they have complete right raise their concerns which should be appropriately addressed they should be paid extra for all efforts they put

what agitating farmers could not achieve by their prolonged agitation could be done by capt amarinder singh i think largely efforts of captain coupled with election politics which led central govt reconsider issue pave way for captain victory in punjab election no political party however can claim role in this issue enough hints were already dropped by him in advance about course central govt needs but how small fraction of farmers have become block larger section
forgien media always glorifies punjabis no one showed rakesh tikait ravi azad mandeep punia we haryanvis rajasthani and up jats stupid

said about decrease in farming but reason using of more and more urea pesticides and herbicides which causing soil erosion and fertility problem and other problem distrubution end who doing these protest and made farmer as there employer who saying there system will be gone problem this bill gonna impact distributors not farmer so as this distributor creating hovac and those who saying they do not need this farm bill but before these bill all farmer were protesting amid this bill even when was passed every political party appreciated but as know people want defame image
just one question if existing bills so beneficial farmers then why farmers situation so poor in india and if farmers situation poor now then we should try something this bjps bill have some loop holes but everyone talking about negative points no one has focussed on pros opposition should try neglect that loop holes by giving some ideas bjp govt if they do not have any then they should stop misleading farmers no government pure soul but one point no any government will try push farmers let them suicide think about twice

around 70 of rural india depends primarily on agriculture for their livelihood of which 80 of farmers being small and marginal
really appreciate your way of presenting all bills but i would like point out that gradual weakening of apmcs can hurt local economies so i would suggest govt strengthen apmcs and then look towards private enterprises deal with our farmers so that farmers can have best of options and let them decide that whom do they want sell their produce apart from that ensuring minimum support price even for corporates will be welcome step
danga gang congress party and his all supporters party
way samdish coverage works that makes sympathise with farmers we know why farmers want full repeal of laws but what samdish not covering why govt adamant on bringing these laws maybe no one from govt ready explain him need of these laws modi government did pretty bad job way passed these laws with nearly no support from other political parties farmers their leaders and farmer unions wish this issue resolves with farmers going back home happy

price assurance and farm services act 2020
bjp always licking feets of sikhs but sikhs did not vote bjp in general election or delhi election
i personally have just one issue with this analysis which treat word farmers as homogeneous group i believe all analysis on farmers issues will become much more nuanced once we start categorising different types of farmers based on their landholdings mechanisation labour employed etc status quo definitely benefits some stakeholders otherwise would not have existed and any reform will hurt this category at end of day if reform hurts richest category of farmers marginally in short run while increasing options for most marginal category of farmers then comes down who do support in this scenario
nice video with so much information just for my clarity that if msp plays very crucial role then why currently only 6 of farmers taking benefit of this why long time back people did not oppose bringing msp not guideline but law can guide me
got information that pakistan jihadis and khalistan groups joined china get involved in farmers issues with punjab farmers
total injustice farmers people of india by bjp who have suppressed people ask for their rights by imposing unconstitutional laws and forces people pay tax government government facilities at nominal price but selling airports rails energy corporates will put extra burden public no mercy of dying farmers worst government ever seen

journalism at best telling every lie of this godi govt and media
this bill could be implemented with covering loopholes atleast law which earning profit in for farmers may be msp or some different way establish same
conclude bill only enrich farmers eliminating middlemen looters these misleading people by extremists groups
farmers in india first of all does not face one issue but several leading this dire state of them these dozens in number and will be very hard tackle at ones some of notable ones includes small scale consistent exploitation adverse market forces issues with distribution and supply chains lack of access finances and capital climatic vulnerability access markets etc just name few as said difficulties many but we can broadly categories them 4 5 core problems as most others just branches out of these core issues
remember first day of punjab farmers that told kanoon radh nhi nhi jaaenge
india has several languages and many farmers didnot know what farmers bill
not yet wait for real truth one system in all india one prices in all india not state by state equal rights equality will save all farmers

law was protect farmers modiji gave enough time for them understand and accept laws but they refused see truth in end instead of prolonging this agitations government thought of repealing these laws but farmers who losers they will realise this truth very soon

harsimrat kaur badal supported bill in press conference 4 5days before
if we ask any big corporate make deal with another big corporate they can handle that on their level because they well experienced in that but our farmers currently not at that level where they can make great deal with reliance or adani or any big private organisations so absolutely very easy for any big corporate exploit them for their profit so we need certain mechanism where we can protect our farmers that why whether msp or something else we definitely need some mechanism protect our farmers from these corporates as long as our farmers have not come into that level where they can handle this by their own
like land bill was repealed but some amendments were done later and now land acquisition happening just way modi wanted but in another way i am sure has something in mind regarding this also farm laws will be implemented but in different way

i always evaluate all laws by their merit whether modi or upa govt i strongly feel law highly beneficial people of india and must for india become superpower extremely hypocritical on part of people of indian origin overseas who against this bill so many farmers from india have migrated different parts of world in last 50 years ie would they do they had those opportunities back at home law wants people move people jobs of higher income attain higher education help india become superpower

kisan andolan sponsered by congress and other parties
doubling farmers income joke of decade
up punjab elections changed stance what else could be such delayed response
modi agriculture has positive gdp that why modi brought anti farmers bill negative gdp of agricultural setup
its high time that millions of indian unemployed youths in groups of five from urban semi urban and rural india join hands with village farmers and their families process collect transport and deliver all village produce at city town dwellers door step give farmers their msp instantly get back your cost profit from customers on delivery this can be done from every corner of our country start parallel marketing of village products by weekly delivery at cheaper price than reliance big basket big bazar spencer etc every city town households go for shopping these vegetables fruits groceries non veg items at minimum double prices from open or super markets cut short of middle men and agencies and ultimately business houses
what deeply pains me fact that this decision repel was made on heavy political encumbrance and not on entirety of farm law bjp made mistake of not carrying out due diligence with farmer stakeholders in first place and was very haste with farm law much wiser and inclusive decision should have been made on sector like agriculture that contributes over 15 of country gdp and employs over 50 of population directly and indirectly thou i totally agree with good number of farmers grievances but personally i was in favor of farm law and sad that has go away like this i feel even sadder this law has be scrapped under political burden and not because of law itself
i think farm bills good and they revolutionary as well
why police using lathis for these farmers they should either use ak47 or ak56 rifles
good work democracy still exist happy day for farmer
3 why indian minister now meet with taliban in doha if they were fruad
1 farmers allowed sell outside of apmc but who these potential buyers from here comes importantfact about fpos on ground can see many of these fpos formed by small group of farmers as per regulations which not same as highlighted during 2nd bill discussion as farmers were creating artifical inflation as result farmers can now participate as another stakeholder in supply demand chain
in 2014 god make me pm help farmers comedy of year

sir ground reality in punjab there so much unrest in punjab due unemployment poverty and political vaccum all these kisaan leaders just wanted become mla and fight elections nd they hv told lies that their lands will b stolen by adani ambani because of already unrest people believed these leaders nd followed them blindly bt this going pay worse for punjab in coming years
we know our farmers from punjab well off they self sustaining good see all having sufficient food for 6 months but i am just curious as well concerned know where more than 1 million people going for relieving themselves everyday if they going for open defecation then very sad and health hazard neighbouring regions those organisations who supporting this movement and our brothers from foreign nations should also built portable toilts and stps for these farmers this area clean
congress party agitating these farmers from punjab they attacking police
so we can easily understand that they knew about fake farmers clearly but not so big cuz many powerful decisions have been by him without any public protest
these laws in force in punjab since 2013 and in haryana since 2006
these farm laws were 1991 moment of indian agriculture
corporate will buy at higher prices till times apmc gets defunct for 2 4 yrs once monopoly established then know what gonna happen
india has indirect 100 crore farmers but we need 10 lack farmers
hindu were patience with congress for 70 yrs so let support modi atleast for 35 yrs

amrinder sing has become broker or dalal for govt break this agitation farmer leaders should be very careful and remain united
msp ak security price for farmer but not real price of commodity understand fact farmer should get real price of his goods in beneficial or profit price of his goods labhkari value
whole video based on negative assumptions about farm laws there actually monopoly of establishied traders in mandi who controlling market this bill will break mandis safe haven for handful of exploitative traders new bill bring in more buyers for farmers produce automatically better price relisation just want stick with old red tape system which halted india progress since 1950 1990
punjab has go for industrialisation and let farming done by haryana and mp and who funding this protest
would have been better if had done little more research on farm bills and had explained government point of view too
farmers will have right sell anywhere in india rather than local mandi where they cant get profit
farmers so aware about their rights and govt calling them misguided even they speak english better than modi hatsoff our farmers
bjps crime against indian farmers

i think most of farmer relatives in canada even khalistani relatives also there so its natural canada p support panjab farmer protests
when did india flag changed and what about other states farmers oops only some states farmers feeding free of cost
if this such evil bill then why not farmers from other parts of country protesting in fact many other farmers more than ones protesting on highways and causing civil unrest support bill
why this farmers protest not in congress and opposition ruling states only around delhi for more than one years by disturbing normal life in that area
kisan india yaar 1 saal sey andolan karrey funded agents bjp tackle dhekna but very difficulty situation bjp hopefully up and punjab elections save bjp why bjp not using phone tapping of anti indians those who wants destroy india in name of kisan andolan
funny how congress had same bill in their manifesto in 2014 and also after passing in september now suddenly they support protest
i hope this time people protest laws if govt wants repeal laws specifically for punjab fine they have problem with let them do whatever they want but why should other farmers suffer for do not repeal for entire country give exception punjab and if required haryana also
shame on indian media
in this bill farmers can not sue corporates in court and they only have right go sdm do think sdm has more power than those rich corporates
thanks for showing truth that indian media not showing
awesome straight forward explanation like jalebi and u literally said that now farmers should have educate enough right terms and conditions wow now straight point does not look like that u r against bill just make this video convince people that bill actually good for farmers and shows in starting of video when u said that who already sets their perspective about this farming bill do not have watch video my english not too good but i tried that who ever read this can understand in easily
after watching this video i realized that there many loop holes in ours previous mandi and also in these 3 bills

farmers god they our annadata long live democracy long live india
sadly not much can be done people will not let farmers sell their food their selves because for upper casts do and people believe farmers should live in bad conditions because karma says they deserve so people overlook
ones who protesting not in majority majority of farmers support farm laws
possible that farm laws have been repealed because like last parliamentary session opposition would try create ruckus and there some very important bills regarding cryptocurrency and probably related which needs be passed very difficult for me digest fact that pm modi would tarnish his image and not think abt actual farmers just for some elections
apmc should organized farmers and on behalf of farmers apmc should deal with corporates
taliban quick learners version 2 0 learning from israel china and india how control protestor
not breakthrough for farmers but for yogi das and for bjp for their next assembly elections in up and other states
protect farmers always
if think modiji did not think of consequences of repealing farm laws then did not understand him at all wait and watch what up his sleeves next much more than just up and punjab elections
dear farmers more support for youstay unitedlet show farmers power greatest power

god pls save my country and be with farmers
good decision this decision should have come before death of 700 farmers
in science theres saying if your ideas good but if cant communicate them properly then your ideas worthless government should seriously think about coming up with infographic presentations before important bill im sure same miscommunication will happen with one nation one election
this all for coming elections farmers still do not forget all those hardships all those people who died due this all those people who brutally murdered by running over vehicle on them we have vote that fraud out and drag every godi media court who tried defame farmers mothers and country or else this will never end
1 04 shaantipoorna bhutni 26th jan ko shaanti poorn i agree these laws were not beneficial for farmers from start but saying that this whole protest has been peacefull not correct lot of anti national elements were taking over this protest fuel their personal agendas khalistan movement somehow got associated i do not how and should not have been and blocking roads was never good option protests meant for better running of democracy and not prove be pain in for common people
people like rakesh tikat ji need of hour
indian government ko northern alliance ko support
4 government has procure these commodity sell common people we can include private companies state body procure these products from farmers sell in mandies because in india even common people poor lives apart from big mc d or amul company
whole video revolved around party politics how bjp and modi more important and most important aspect what farmers could have gained or could have lost with law coming into effect which was completely ignored but who cares about that in journalism nowadays what country needs and all they rather happy with siding with bjp or other party
what outsiders do not understand that farm bills were made with intention of benefiting farmers not destroy peace yes definitely government has not listened these farmers cries or given them enough attention that why they behaving like this situation unfortunate
in any system mandi system or contract farming and cold storages finally what will help farmer honest system people always trying cheat and steal wherever they can and this has nothing do with govts which traditionally have very weak and inefficient law enforcement
bihar farmers got lower prices probably because necessary reforms did not place in other states particularly important markets in western northern metropolises where they would get better prices for produce bypass their own apmcs did not mention what happened maharashtra farmers may be was other way round
lot of love farmer supporters
one who have read bills carefully and understood would never oppose for welfare of small and marginal farmers very bad decision for farmers future people who r barking here do not even know how farmers suffering and what agriculture actually and how much essential thess bills for them mark my words will see consequences of this on farmers life economist r not fool support bills but unfortunately we have whatsapp university professors i not bhakt just read bills once

govt at least now could move on and focus on other sectors for economic growth probably watered down version of this farm laws could be enacted in bjp ruled states or center might enact laws strengthen and bring transparency existing setup
great victory against evil
by now removing msp they have now removed only safety net they had but refused give them option refine crops back so effectively killing farmers
1 might lead hoarding and black marketing majority of farmers storing their own crops can be tough task on other hand revision of ec list can give corporates upper hand store manipulate price their benefit
points raised by farmers towards police exact points

purposely didnt control situation we also have videos of police taking selfie with farmers at red fort and sitting on side instead of stopping there was no violence until that point so what happened obviously was preplanned way barricades installed at delhi borders i wish had installed at borders where china built village inside india
delhi people also sport farmers this only one sector not in loss they always battle performance then why need new lows
heartfelt see this i confidently believed that our visionary leader who willing do exceptional work and his services beyond his limits for this nation will find new way for farmers welfare because has no grudges towards farmers true leader

1 goi and many intellectuals like sg made wrong assumption that farmers anpadh gawar most of anpadh gawar farmers referred by sg had full support of their highly educated children fact that people who have no knowledge of farming practices as well as farming community die hard supporters of so called farm reforms only lead delayed rollback of not so reformist laws
well they should have fight from beginning if all afghanistan against taliban then definitely taliban wont be there

no flat checking and no understanding of issue delhi police comes under centre and not under 2ndly there very visible involvement of khalistan in these protests very much visible from funding backed by khalistan supported protests in uk usa if still have any doubt then do your research
msp does not promote improvement in production process what does creates fake sense of security on price which can be obtained farmers have think like businessmen calculating their costs potential revenue and then profits so they should be provided information on market rates as per demand and supply and become more competitive i e try and reduce input costs increase yield using latest technologies such as drip irrigation farmers should do multi cropping crop rotation maintain quality of soil and increase per acre yield and promote sustainable farms
2022 up election 2024 modi

bill 3 hoarding will result in controlling of prices suppose there bumper crop production due high level supply price of crop will reduce so corporates who have huge facilities of storing these foods will hoard now when supply less and prices go up these companies will not buy due obvious reasons as costly for them farmer will be facing difficulty in both situations if there rule for msp for all players in market then i think will reduce uncertainty

delhi needs be afraid of rss bjp hindutvastani gundas like in lakheem pur and haryanas lhattar and not kisan
this students do not know anything about anti farmers facts in farmers bills same like rakesh tikait and others do not know anything about anti farmers facts in farmers bills
i fully support reformative farm law biggest enemy of india not china socialism and communism we need more free market look repealing of farm law was actually failure of indian youth future was ours if we going in these same manner we will not have any improvements
end of day result governments bills on farmers useless and farmers not getting benefit out of thank
this not farmers protest our farmers not so rich these political caders
we need farmers feed shame on indian government
please support farmers
although i was not in favour of imposing of income tax for farmers but i think now time has come that becoz of assured irrigation and msp paricularly in punjab haryana excluding southern haryana who owns more than 10 ha of land income tax slab of 10 on farm income should be imposed and collection of that income should be used for small farmers of these two states by giving special scheme of income generating activities
malicious efforts of government shameless government there no pity in my heart with farmers now
salute farmers atlas justice prevailed
allah will help afghanis fight these paxtaani talibani terrorists

india and always with farmers
seems present farmers protesters have no trust in bhartiya kisan sangh
wow what great explanation i see how these bills so so bad for our farmers thank for opening my eyes
view held by many that laws framed in way that does not just attract private players into market but supports and protects them as they gradually over agriculture sector easing actual farmers and landowners out systematically
i stand with farmer
in my experience farmers and villagers widely influenced by politics and they always interested be part of political party this what i have seen throughout maharashtra
these much needed bills but only on pretext that enough infrastructure created indian agriculture did not improve any further after these msp introduced why did not we join rcep because of inherent weakness in our markets where govt primary force but with this system not going develop any further same was issue when 1991 lpg reforms were up but we have seen its impact though there structural weaknesses in our economy these needs be corrected benefit fully only farmers from 2 states cannot decide future for rest of country
modiji affraid of up election
first of all administration should have some action before republic day because they must know that something will come of course on this day because farmers were already given warning that they would extract tractor march
farmer leaders failed coz they took full responsibility and digested their own words that was excepted during meeting with delhi commissioner
if farmers stop producing for just one year every one will understand
one peculiar observation that i came across this these excessive and explicit anti hindu activities by maulana modi have suddenly aggravated after ram mandir verdict by sc
congratulations farmers

i think that this bill should be implemented but loopholes of this bill should be resolved by government coz i think that these all problems were started because farmers were not educated enough handle these big things
i wish bjp loses in elections i so do
best of luck all farmers for your future
ma am so intelligent i think can convience farmers im impressed

bjp selling nation railways and roadways adani and ambani why no action against them
this channel of tukde tukde gang why call this duplicate farmer if gets 10 crores also will say budget bad do not call this anti india people only negative how has earned his empire
this government of course has brute majority in parliament but on whole quiet lot of people genuinely think many of top governmental functionaries lack much needed sophistication and grace people also lot frustrated with constitutional organs like judiciary who often perceived as siding with ruling party rightly or wrongly what government should understand that negative politics being bombarded on indian polity by bjp today has limit and there should be proper governance transcending mediums of caste and creed rulers in democracy must be humble and going roughshod over farmers who feed country not good politics
i support farmers 200
i know very hard farm like in this time but throwing india flag like this shame on punjabi

i agree with everything in this video but they should think that different states has different rates for crop and lets assume there two states state 1 and state 2 and in state 1 rate of everything lowest from every other state and farmers produced crop in low price and in state2 rate of everything highest and framer produced crop in high price what if farmers from state1 go state2 and sell they in high rates so what will farmer of state2 do because has produced crop but cannot sell because crop has already been sold by other farmers does will go lower state and sell there and will go in loss answer no if government really want help farmers why do not they just solve problem state wise because every state not same or government want give profit farmers of one state and loss other fact punjab and haryana has highest rate for crops
proud of punjab haryana zindabad so emotional vedio

farmers very much benefitted by this bill new era be seen in field of agriculture sector
all citizens of all fields should support kisans
i am not sure about your mindset as seems oppose govt for anything without constructive idea i suggest rather sticking msp or repeal all 3 laws would have been better force govt make necessary changes in existing laws for welfare of farmers laws ko wapas karwane political people tube channels walon hi benefit actual kisaan only loss hi deshbhakt chutiya hi kaat better suggest force govt have required laws for welfare of farmers aise again 0 hi aa improvement msp not long term solution plus aise protest law ko wapas karwane tareeka will be dangerous in future ch tiyon ko samajhta only politics chamkani aur paisa bana gareeb kisaan naam gareeb kisaan pareshan

we stand with farmer
already farmers doing suicide cause of no coming profite out from their land and this new farm bill going do more damage and suicide rate also going rise up definitely should be change
i am farmer very well explained sir
farmers with weapons they should be jailed
3 i do agree that there will be increased intervention by private players in farm produce sector however at every point farmer decision making authority wether they wanna deal at apmc mandis or direct buyer and wether they wanna get into finite contract with private buyer or they wish sell their produce as they have been doing all this while
we farmers not terrorist
as young citizen of india laws like these that scare me about where my country gonna end up in few years and fact that these have become acts i really hope justice can be served i do not know bout all but as indian when i eat i cannot help but have sense of guilt know that someone who worked hard and gave me this food being mistreated we know country not doing that good when their own farmers being mistreated where basic morals and values we we taught as kids respect farmers and support them have gone remember no matter how huge no matter how much money or power hold always be thankful and support farmers fact that american celebrities and media outside speaking about this makes me happy because as indian i have shamefully agree that in my very own country there people who support this act and people who against this just remember all cowards with power all hold power right now but at end justice will be served all absolutely shameless and don t hold sense of guilt remember no matter what we protest with peace and we will win truth airways wins
we people of india never feel better towards evm scammer rulers repeal of farmers law like crazy crocodile tears and double faced snakes playing role suppose if research from ground survey speaks nearly 10 crores farmers signed contract farming papers intellectual estimate evaluate realize later future facts true prediction be recorded this comment in other words modi rss won match surgical strike dramatic footage
sir seeing we can 100 say that tomorrow india in safe hands jai hind jai bharat jai kisan
i have done my llb in germany explained everything very well but there farmers who protesting in germany because there no msp farmers being pressurized by private sector as there no msp farmers getting lowest rate there should be msp on every product
this move will once again encourage minority go against feature nrc law one nation one law for all community this move will harm image of modi in upcoming up election after death of around 600 small farmers if u back step nothing will help u out
how cruel this bjp modi ji party hurted sikhs allotted
okay where all pro farmer protest after 26th jan violence heres your right peaceful and non violent protest so called farmers and that too indian farmers had removed national flag from red fort
rather than farmers
tikait farmer i wanna start doctor agitation
farmers always their sign as l king of lions
we love our farmers
cricket stadiums being hired contain farmers
farmers sat in colds for more than 70 days and government still not ready do settlements and then what point of calling jai jawan jai kisan in our slogans they really important indirectly government also reason for violence happened at red fort and yes violence in any form unacceptable
actually after watching this seems modi hi let happen so they can destroy farmers protest hope so
i think only option left bringing all political parties together atleast one who were in nda and of course opposition parties because that will clear out doubt of large section of farmers on government intention they need start again and go deep into matter of laws and also please restrict these news channels plzz
good explanation law good for farmer and people of india except middleman
sir absolutly right bjp was acting as congress and presently modi working as neharu
if current system so good why farmers suiside in mh up bihar and we hear no less cases in green revolutions area like punjab laws could have been better for other farmers but nothing can be reformed in this country black friday for indian agriculture sector
poor farmers in fear of adjustment new laws and rich dalals gundagardi
even i support farmers i belong farmers family but whole world polarised and everyone shows what suits thr ideology truth now just version of individual
most of states does have majority of micro farming land holding so they mostly produce for self consumption punjab and haryana originally which part of punjab does have majority of small farming land holdings so we grow part for self consumption and major part for rest of country
wish government would explain this farmers nicely articulated summarised historic references and whole stitching together was truly cutting clutter
while i have utmost respect for everyones perspective and also understand completely fear that farmers have of being absolutely buldozed by private sector if things do not work way govt has anticipated as response they do not wish accept these changes and its their right not however what i do not understand oversimplification and having myopic view
not thei even single educated farmer farmers will suffer asusual
sir started with farm laws and your discussion quickly degenerated towards caa we understand very clearly what happening all this aandolan not going stop at farm laws farmers in far far larger part of india was supportive of these laws let see if our pm wants on repealing good laws like this and still hope win next election
condition may not improve unless govt sets limit of cost margin percentage bot consumer and farmer will be looted
violence was perpetrated by ruling bjp moddis government and they conspired blame on protesting farmers fortunately enough they got caught in their conspiracy i too fully support indian farmers
election season can do wonders for indians but seems with not honest intent
problems that farmers facing wont be limited farmers alone they will next show up in general society as well current government has succeeded in placing future of next generation of children of this country into deep slavery by promoting endless privatization transferring wealth riches performing changes in rules that were protecting democracy so far
in which world do these right wing leaning economist live about 85 of indian farmers small and marginal how can they even survive without state support in form of msp subsidy research and extension marketing infrastructure irrigation et al
there was no stone pelting simply they were protesting car mowed on peaceful farmers from behind windscreen was not broken just was down while driving
support farmer not bro
farmers win
indian farmers should be always slaves for mandi brokers can go any town market and see who owning and controlled farm market i think most of people wont noticed
just fool not compulsory moreover farmers may opt for going and selling outside of mandi get good prices
more options good please do not fool people if farmers like use apmc let them use let them not stuck with apmc only
shree yogiji best cm of bharat
actual headline for this video should be farmers attacked for protesting by police and govt
i support farmer always kejriwal party right
thank farmers for everything
just go all out against these fake farmers who supposed work in their fields not patrol highways
and niyu i felt this video put up half facts which resulted one side weighing heavier than other video started with some facts about how many police personnel were injured how many barracks were destroyed then video also shows how police being attacked by farmers showed sikh man with kirpan was attacking police but where videos of of police attacking protesters which included people who participated in rally and also ones who were watching from side where videos of police not doing anything when they saw protestors reaching red fort takes more than 30mins get red fort from designated route which was enough time for police action and stop them where fact that there were barracks in route which was agreed upon and no barracks blocking way red fort why police did not do laathi charge on people when they were going go red fort and instead they did on those who were going on route which was given by delhi police even if will say that was mentioned or showed in video emphasis was not given on them as compared other side more research and content was needed
not done for love of farmer but rather with up elections in mind sad so many farmers had pay with their lives
wait minute protest for farmers and bill passed for every state of india but bro only farmers of 2 states being infront and funny thing mohit sharma told baar up me sarkar aane bro 75 seats aa gyi modi
farmers will produce what in demand not like traditional rice or wheat only
now government make law all farmer sold his crops only adnai group or ambani they cheat with farmer bucz they buy farmer crops on half rate and sale in market 5 time that truth
farmers unite religion for survival

this bill removing middle man who earn profit without working in field this bill help farmers earn more income through production
true farmers have been working on their fields no impact on them paid protesters perpetrators foreign hands confused entire opposition in fix as what politicise for future so no wonder that priyanka tries rake up new issue
i wish this gets more views than those pretend know all celebs who pro anti farmers bill on twitter sm amazing video can finally make sense of this situation still hard say if this will prove beneficial detrimental our farmers
farmers were like this works in netherlands
who said they farmers
this officers orating hindi welll seems manu wadi kids and of godi sarkaar
if farmers dont want those bill then modi have listen if these bills for their benefit then absolutely their right choose or refuse those bills and they refuse do not forget just because of public and i think fit on tea stall rather than chair of pm
poor farmers will be care of by modi through different vehicle key was diffuse real threat of unrest that was being manufactured through drugged punjabi youth and khalistan and pakistan this wise decision of modi now opposition has no election agenda as well
we support this bill if one state not get advantage from does not means let other poor farmers also suffer
i am now doubting your knowledge on other issues there no market fees applicable on farmers can u specify section law
beginning of end of bjp this going be graveyard of bjp and modi
first understand farmer bill proposed by government
what act of qustion and answer show guy looks proper rehearsed and few portions was beep properly they trying hide bjp name and put blame on ex congress minister shame on up police but this was expected shame shame up police
farmers should file complaint
stop calling them farmers
good effort pm tried help small farmers but ultra rich middle men hijacked reforms india does not deserve change i guess
whole world watching farmers protest good work finally new channel where we can see some real news updates
i stand with farmers
80 of farmers who were small and non violent were defeated and remaining 20 of rich and rogue farmers have won very unfortunate
hum odisha kisan we need this law increase our incomee please dont opposee
i used support modi government however in last few month modi government has not done marvel of job i am sure people will hold them accountable for their failure in seeing future what seems be trend of modi government taking decision resolve issues on short term basis they lack long term view and issue that may come up
shame on bjp govt modi think of people do not be stupid like
shame for which claiming be super power and most advanced army in world while even after 20 years of fighting against tribal and non professional terrorist group taliban taliban still remains and usa in battlefield has been defeated
disrespect tricolor disrespect whole india khalistan murdabad no religious flag cannot place of we will do everything for its respect and dignity
imho farmers should not forget what bjp did and they should not give b p single vote at any cost and repeals of farmer bills not grace of mo i result of struggle of honorable farmers
standwithfarmers
problem was with farmers of punjab haryana and small part up other states looser according me more than 90 of farmers looser merely temporary victory for so called intellectuals farmers and opposition also in long run after six months or 90 farmers will demand for reintroduction of farm laws and at that time all this bunch will not be seen only 2 25 states big farmers brokers politicians not india and they can not dictate terms for whole india certainly decision anti farmers
skill of falsifing truth really unique with godi media
there competition among students sports people small business people big business people rural urban etc but why only north few states farmers staging protests central govt majorly north hindi party so why soo gaga about reforms farmers should welcome competition rather doing politics
support farmers they fighting for every citizen
this decision by keeping in mind upcoming elections in punjab and up
support farmers for our future food at fair price
by this draconian law we lost life of 600 farmers modi such arrogant and sadist pm in indias history
they hooligans not farmers creating anarchy on streets dm has full right force law and order
some one trying play foul put farmers in bad light there were barricades all over place except on way red fort deep sidhu responsible for this farmers and farmer leaders do not support this act majority of sikhs saying this wrong sikh flag has its own place and definitely this was not right place and time strict action should be against miscreants
march up farmers dont have anything do with protests as we do not get msp
tikait who him self hails from up has sacrifice totally ignored interests of poor and landless farm labourers of up bihar etc who come punjab etc and agricultural field on lease theka from absentee including nri land owners details of these landless tillers not mentioned in revenue records girdawars patwaris bribed state names of absentee land owners including nri as kasht i e actual tillers migrant landless tillers remain faceless nameless and helpless
well said but why indian media weeping as afghanistan in its neighborhood
no govt took wrong decision repeal farm laws but this was very much req in current scanrio of internal security threat and they do not want loose up election bcz only punjab going be backward in coming years if our punjabi repeat same things again rolling back will hurt farmers not immediately but in long run they must think about
4 06 godi media shows its true face even if ajay mishra did not send anyone crush farmers fact either his son ashish mishra or son friend ankit das have killed farmers if ajay mishra sent these ppl kill farmers will be more serious for him remember ajay mishra openly threatened farmers few days before this incident
this farm bill disaster instead of asking for farm bill other state farmers should ask for msp market like punjab and haryana implementing farm bill like digging ur own grave for multi billion dollar corporate companies
good hope all concerned parties drop their ego in favour of bottom farmer and end user consumer
when talked about export of onions have checked what price were onions procured for export or domestic sales does not matter when comes procurement price problem farmers have that procurement prices msp not fixed for 100 of produce unlike every other product which have benchmark rates say milk egg petrol grocery tv car etc
salute all indian farmers shame of police politicians police not for people they for politicians

andheri raat sunhari subah we should stand with our beloved farmers
westandwithfarmers
my sympathy with bjp innocent workers and ministers and his brother and son who killed kisaans and still alive also my sympathy with those kisaans who got murdered by these people should not be done culprit should be punished hard there no space for violence in democracy
also says now if that same wheat or rice was bought by private traders maybe at higher price now not that very ideal situation which corporate works for benefits other than their own how here farmer benefitted not rhetorical question i am actually trying understand this good law
farmers have been protesting in cold for 30 40 days in freezing climate obviously agitation will increase when nothing done by government amend bill have some empathy comon
may be tarik fateh agent i mean never know hmari kahi pohunch jati allhamdullillah or indian media always bewaqoof hi bnta like now
why not talking about provision in farmers bill providing contractor loan on farmers land
anyone of them in this session do not have any proof or experience in their resume how govern modi has and has shown in gujarat i am also not happy by modi government for taking back kisan bill what kind of options we have set congress back or what
very well research priya mam why do not be middleman negotiate between govt and farmers
now they withdrawal this plz anyone from farmer family tell does this bill good or bad for u
very good question raised by mr tikait ji about pm sir during on election time strictly supereme court should prevent present prieminester of india for his party election rally for publicity not allowed him its law bill should come parliament in future and should debate in india also for public meeting through local news national news tv as well as public media and newspaper and then be approval from president of india law should be strongly apply for everyone political party of india in future i am agreed with mr tikait ji question and hindi
only modiji jay hind
why cannot poor farmers of bihar or up grow needed crops instead of farmers of punjab or haryana who quite experienced in cultivation of wheat
but end of day its big loss for small farmers and this whole thing was just political game bcoz same bill was opposed by bjp too when cong tried pass in parliament so i think was just tit for tat thing from opposition and job saving technique from rich and powerful middlemen
while i have great respect for farmers i have few questions for them currently farmers completely pampered lot who pretty much get everything free of cost electricity free water free loans at no interest and waivers in case of poor output income tax waived on top of all this they want minimum price guarantee so my questions as follows
there steady decline in agricultural production as depicted during times when archaic farm bill existed
more strength farmers
with technology and new acts actually farmers can be price makers with online platform for farmers sell their products
remove bjp and save country remove evm and save democracy godi media murdabad
i support farmers thank bbc
modi govt does not seem farmers friendly after passing farmer amendment bill

this explanation was best one more power farmers
quite clever how sg avoided mentioning fact that protests have resoundingly flopped in all other states of india even western up popped up after tikait entered scene and tikait no match for yogi shah combine
farmers protesting in very decent manner without any hindrance public
i have point add claim from farmer that had sold his crops say for 4 dollars per kg its less than his father but fails acknowledge fact that overall produce of farmer per acre land has also increase people dont account for that
obviously these so called reform bills will enhance role by middlemen private traders which prone all exploitations of poor indian farmers these so called reform bills will not decrease this evil role corruption by wealthy middlemen traders which well known in india therefore this being falsely perpetuated by govt that these reform bills will give more profits farmers as they will now be able sell manage marketing of their produce across states even internationally at theor option of setting prices for produce what hoax and deception not realizing absolute lack of requisite threshhold of ability of indian farmers do so
very well explained sir send this video who has very poor knowledge about farm bills and still made video this kind of people very biased and narrow minded thinkers

thanks modi govt for organizing this tractor rally
issue not just related msp something deeply rooted in what economists have been debating for more than 2 decades most of indian farmers own 2 acres or less agricultural land there no way can improve standard of living for these farmers if they work on farm alone msp system coupled with food subsidies help these farmers just survive nothing more economists want indian government push these low acreage farmers out of farms and work into manufacturing and services sectors be as labourer in upcoming factories being moved from china hard say who being adamant here these farmers with very low farm holding who will never be able improve their standard of living with farming or government that thinks moving them out of farm will somehow accelerate pace of manufacturing in india this problem where no one wrong eventually and no one right
agents and agencies anti modi group never allow farmers earn as daughter of farmer i feel sad
let me add something sir msp not on all crops only few general crops like wheat rice sugarcane etc govt says that if msp for wheat 1000per 100kg that means no one can buy less than that where loopholes let me tell not only one what moisture in finished crop downgrade price and who decide that govt authority that first one what others loopholes who gonna fix petroleum prices fertilizer prices seed prices pesticides prices natural disasters all these effects cost of production and who bears farmers
so basically farmers want remain how they they fear change since that will bring uncertainty
still republic showing second part not first shame less godi media
channel not sure if farmer or now anyone hit or injured farmer for channels verify 1st check n recheck do not b hasty
shame on india media and india government
i will not argue any further will just say only one thing for once lets accept that these laws not friendly for people of punjab farmers there just do not want private players enter in punjab then there easier way deal with this
i request all farmers that do not do protest because government so cruel
indian government actually gifting helicopter in way that helping afghan government and handing over taliban so that cannot be used against them

vote for bjp and support for bjp
ravish claims for ground reporting my advise him got kabul have first hand feel whether taliban terrorist or not need not blame social media and general public himself contradicting if afghanistan in crisis and afghani in deep trouble then how come taliban good killing innocent people may be good for ravish not for any sensitive human being this high time should ask these questions himself

i have just one sentence for this farmers law incident
mr shekhar have very well explained paddy and rice situation in punjab and haryana thanks for that i have visited hundreds of apmc mandis in india and found that hardly small and marginal farmers get benefits of mandi system big farmers get all benefits and do all dirty politics state government have politicised mandis and look at mandi management committees they all corrupt political people with their choicest officers they also conniving with traders all kinds of manipulation so that easy money will be there for them that why big farmers who also politicians in association with traders and commission agents creating all these problem further if do research will find that so called farmer organisations and their leaders do not want farmers be independent and well of because if farmers get benefits their leadership will be at stake these people never tried motivate farmers go for diversification about productive utilisation of water and energy they misinformed farmers look at people at dharna place mostly farmers from punjab found does mean that rest of country farmers not there what about people like one ravana people from jnu shahinbag etc doing there slogans and flags and pictures heard and seen there seriously disturbing thanks mr shekhar

shame on indian media shame on central govt
shame on khalistani fake farmers
well good explanation but putting mandatory msp not solution for example if people reduce their cereal intake in next 5 years but msp remains same buyer would be obligated buy commodity that no longer in demand this also kills innovation at farmer end and disincentives them move on crop in demand punjab for example all and all instead of putting msp govt must setup strengthen strong anti competitive body watch over market manipulation and this can protect farmers from unfair prices
goverment only tring find way out of this farmer protest thing and tring suppress protest
now godi will say these kisan all khalistani this what happens when people angry with bjp and godi media has no balls question government jai hind

this guy abhijit smoking some next level weed really simplistic arguments on anything do with modi bjp and really twisted arguments conspiracies on everyone else im from up and i can tell bjp sweeping state farm laws notwithstanding if they wanted be in government in punjab they could have made this compromise long time ago modi wouldnt have held out for 18 months if that was endgame there have be other factors as they say absence of evidence not evidence of absence
this new policy will benifit both consumer n producer only cunning heartless middle will lost their lucrative business farmers protesting because they mislead by some selfish monger
best analysis on repealed farm laws
have comparison about scale avarage size of wheat farm in wheat belt of western australia 4 thousand acres whereas 85 of indian farmers less than 2acres
these not farmers they rioters farmer knows his values
supportfarmers most of these police personnel from farmers families
kerala people support punjabis and farmers
govt will on shouting this nector drink but farmer feels venom so forcefully onluy modiji can impose these lawas and make there friends happy and worlds richest shame on modi ji
when modi government did not bulge nor met tamil nadu farmers when they put their demands in delhi says was trying very end for modi would bulge bull shit where this lady went when tn farmers agitated now its for punjab farmers resigned
these middle man doing not farmers doing protests because they lose their profit
ideally farmers should be able sell directly in mandi anyone or government in regulated environment well that would be possible if farmers have easier access mandi either with help of technology or physical infrastructure also buying or procuring should be done equally from all over india not just few states haryana or punjab
i agree disagree with abhijit cos no go area for bjp in punjab when capt met amitji most political pundits said that farms law wud be scrapped now that case they give alternative views what abhijit dont realise that punjabis seems be politically isolated and congress mukt bharat wud not be realised worst case scenario what if came power
i have been watching your videos on farm laws for while now as punjabi i can say that dont have much idea about opinion in punjab and making your judgements based on local punjabi media initially said govt wrong in saying that protest not just about farm laws and there khalistani elements in protest today govt has been proved right and admitting that protest about politics govt has actually handled this protest way better than expected wait for sometime and will admit that protest also about khalistan
permission was just drama they had planning for farmers but this time they cant stop farmers
third law simply allows private players store farm produces which was not allowed as india was deficient in food production and govt feared hoarding now india has so much food grain production that cannot consume what produces
isupportfarmers nofarmernofood
2 spoke about msp in mandi system only 6 of farmers were benefited with msp or only 6 of them sold their crops at msp price or above stastics from sharada committee
need farmer thrice day survive
already farmer free sell his produce anywhere and can store his produce in any quantity near his farm
farmer will remain poor as long as goons and urban naxal will lead them
please read this as well what assumptions made by economists and how govt trying gain from these farm bills its made for corporates not for farmers
bharat maathake jai kisan agree kalchar farmers fill bill mod filled government fake modi
why cant govt go amongst farmers and explain benefits in manner shown in this programme
there one incorrect statement in this presentation buyer pays tax not farmers which creates thousands of jobs and pays for roads and infrastructure of apmc
basically punjabis and haryanvis reaping most of benefits leaving nothing rest of india and if these bills stay whole india will benefit and share of those farmers will be lesser hence they protesting understood thank sir
farmer should get their rights authorities treating like slaves

after this dont ask again government why farmers does not have right sell their products any were in india this win for richer farmers and middle man
rich farmers want 6 msp and 94 poor farmers who have died because of previous system these leaders not thinking about them hypocriate people using religion
ruling government completely out of touch with needs of farmer please stop persecution of indian farmer this farmers bill sheer torture of farmers and their families whose lives spent patiently toiling on their farms this worst type of tyranny by government
minister son and even so called farmers who killed bjp workers should be charged with murder
i sapport farmers thanks sir for good information about farm bill
farmers let show world how powerful we can be
we were inclusive democracy but since modi 2014 we have now religion based ruler like that in taliban afghanistan saudi arab of india and no more democracy
new farmers bills not only ruins farmers but ultimately directly effect common people of india on long terms not only mandi will be shut down but small hand carts vendors will be out of market all vegetables food grains and essentials commodities will be sold in small packets at high price rates like usa canada australia and other rich county people buying common people can not be efford buy in india if farmers bills will be implicated bad days not be far in india for common people of india
finally good farmer friendly and honest thoughts farming sector bills brought and passed by visionary modi govt one important step rid india corruption that was nurtured by corrupt congress
we all indians support farmer
in end was great attempt help farmers by modiji though obviously farmers do not have advanced vision or blocked by corrupt interest groups that all educated population fully understood from day one hope some day farmers wake up with new vision like modiji

this explanation theoretically correct but but farmers will never able access online market they do not have that expertise what will happen there will be some middle man who buy crop from farmers at low price and sell corporate at high price using this online platform but in mandi farmers they can alleast handle on their own with their limited knowledge
not enough understand both sides i guess yo should understand route cause of farmers could be attempt bring in china investment
sorry say but step uthaya h farmers
people who were talking against farmers were those anti nationals who eat food which actually comes from fields where these farmers work hard farmers should not feed these anti nationals and backstabbers ghar aur rahega

what beautiful capture of spirit of farmers real spirit emotions chara eager make food for everyone courage love culture
shame on zee those who killed 5 farmers innocent shame on
these laws were not fully explained farmers before implementing may be if they had not let be weapon for opposition then all should have been good still i not fully sure these laws benefited farmers on ground they were awesome on paper but not on real life because middle man didnt go anywhere except they now had something fight for greed and power were motives in this whole play in end comman man lost
actually was really that much small amount of protesters who went laal killa not exact 0 1 but max only 1 was only 500 1000 people who reached laal killa and farmers gathering was more than 20 lakhs may be much more than 20 lakhs can get accurate number of gathering from internet and one more thing people listened deep sidhu and lakha sidhana was thinking go ring road they justified that few unknown people who were waiting at turn point started fighting with police then people got confused and follow gathering seems unbelievable but they were literally mostly 1000 farmers who turned laal killa
opposition wants destroy our farmers media should play positive role in explaining correct position otherwise these anti nationals opposition parties would destroy india i my india
really made crystal clear need more people like in this country where young generation with rational mind afraid have political opinion because we do not know whom trust no one here in mainstream media willing give such simple compilation of all necessary details honestly i personally would hate build opinion and choose sides in politics without knowing all facts beforehand and sir have given me facts today hope thrive and find alot of success with this wonderful youtube channel of yours your contributions will be lauded by genuine rational thinker of india
excellent no words proud be punjabi proud be kisan majdoor ekta always won truth congratulations never forget veera great song
why all protestors from punjab if law for farmers of whole country
tamil people support punjabi formers
i agree with sg when says that politically inspired protests ok in democracy however bigger concern here that there clearly foreign players like china and other anti india entities which sponsoring and puppetiering these protest and then writing in global times that india unstable for business they using such protests engineer riots and violence repeatedly that something every indian common or politician or farmer should think about carefully they continue go this path they not just harming themselves and bjp but also our country
we support farmers
stoop conquer what modi doing can and can bring them all back after winning punjab and preponing up elections
i am not going say whether was beneficial or harmful for farmers but what exactly type of example being set
vegetables in our town market on average rs 40 per half kg at same time they being purchased from farmers at rs 15 per kg middle men vendors make huge profits compared farmers but now corporates here with better logistics and strategies beat vendors
indian army wont have same handcuffs that brit usa had wear im pretty sure they would show taliban how its done
international media their audience dumb on indian issues by pointing unpretty bits in attempt smear whole picture and granted india has alot of unpretty bits but truth india needs labour reform land reform farm reform income tax reform among other things and needs them happen yesterday all our political parties have these reforms in their election manifesto but they do not legislate them into law once they in power those that do try legislate strong armed into submission by special interest groups and opposition this bad politics wins and everyone plays
farmers always in lagging stage yes this law might have dragged them more lag but also real victory of middle man anyways this law must have helped big corporates but now without law will be continuing helping traditional middle man agitators of protest
this karnal motherfuckers we will remember this haryana will remember this bjp will not return haryana for at least 2 more decades
please do not call these people as farmers because they hooligans from congress party
punjab our pride our india pride but have worst step that could have been

they still pray for india who calls them khalistanis or naxals
opposition leader think farmers brainless
also have bothered speaking any farmer before coming conclusion maybe go protest site and speak them and then share your perspective itll be little more responsible of
farmers doing what they think right and police doing their duty earn for their family one who sitting in ac room eating amazing foods and just giving orders stop them instead of finding way calm this situation
mafia apprehends government trying plug drain hole has be old system will go off as farmers start using more efficient avenues

we support farmers these 3 laws will affect each and every poor and middle class person these laws designed make farmers slave and give monopoly of food production and control over supply and demand few big capitalists this will create inflation rate skyrocketed and hunger starvation will become biggest problem in india since majority of people would be unable eat and fulfill their basic needs farmers will sell at cheapest price and we consumers urban people will buy their production at insanely inflated prices will generate more and more poverty and unequal wealth distribution which already in disastrous condition
true freedom farmers
kisan majdoor ekta zindabad stand with farmers
said that bihar farmers sold their produce for lesser price than other states after abolition of apmc that makes sense because government of other states purchased crops at msp at expense of tax payer at higher price than private entity would pay without msp
khalistan khalistan and khalistan alone only solution protect sikhism and churhda punjab

my gosh never thought i would hear such ill informed ill advised and self contradictory piece from sg which lacks in overall understanding of things bjp made this issue of national unity nothing can be farther from truth who have not seen videos giving calls in name of sikhhi as far back as october or november i guess these protests have only shown that how fragile punjab has been all along
i kno wire would have got more ppl supported bill but as usual wire show only those ppl who against gov
this distrust among them for themselves indicate that not really farmers who protesting because those people who protesting believe that farmers will start selling crops private companies
can someone who understands this bill completely tell me why only farmers of haryana and punjab protesting while farmers from maharastra mp up and many others do not have problem with this bill this bill in some way affecting farmers of only these two states or this bill only applies some type of harvest which predominantly grown in these two states pls do not give any political answers reply only if have some valuable insights thx

sukhbir agro of sukhbir singh badal had income of at least 5000 crores annually was commission agent between fci and farmers his company used get 2 5 commission all warehouses belonged him no farmer could sell even kg of wheat fci without tag of sukhbir agro
most people here or even have not plight of farmers in europe so no point in following them in first place as far as agriculture goes
if market works magically and without monopoly why there preference for procurement deep down supporters of laws give arguments that why only punjab and haryana get enjoy procurement in doing so even they concede that market prices arent as remunerative for farmers than procurement prices if yourselves know then why do support such ill thought reforms most industrialised nations implemented these reforms and small landholders were wiped out in few decades unlike wisdom of shekhar and sanghi lot in industrialised nations only large landholders have eventually survived what plan does government have for people from villages who will eventually lose out their small holdings as privatisation and commercialisation makes their land holdings unviable china had plan had skilled their population what do we have in fact during covid were villages that sustained most of immigrant labour that came back as cities couldnt provide for them
ppl protesting here non r farmers

excellent and informative show i am from pakistan and respect ravish kumar very capable and honest
i hope someday can do some honest reporting today sadly i do not see that happening sheer unpopularity of these protests what do not show absolute need for farming reform what do not cover media loves drama and they playing this up fill airtime in india your echo chambers here transmit their agenda suit your tastes so play up
only punjabs and parts of haryana not only farmers in india these farm laws going help poor class farmers these people think every farmers having same problem but nope if come bihar and odisha there situation so worst these so called farmers only thinking about their profits not single person protesting would have read bill completely
i guess most peaceful organised and genuine protest in history of india if not in history of whole world i mean why do u want pass bills if ppl being affected by them not happy r u out of your damn mind

god bless india farmer
right just give one good alternative of modi and bjp will loose election
very unfortunate that bjp government had reverse farmer laws these laws were actually game changer for indian farmers and agriculture produce
indians living all over world want justice for farmers what breaks my heart that pm modi has not once acknowledged agitation of farmers how can pm show such indifference how can ignore agitation going on for months its just unbelievable and unfair central government instead of trying understand farmers has activated nia investigation on people who providing resources these farmer protesters such as feeding sanitation and other resources government wants deter these protestors by attacking their support
lol your father gave suggestions but yet 10000 farmers in punjab committed suicide in akali dals time
indian do not have required numbers of fighter jets and helicopters but we gift others everytime in indian development and scientific progress there huge advertising by our media and vote bank we do little but speaks more we have economic crisis but we spend money for parliament and other projects for afghanistan why should we pay tax for
government of india has provide food and shelters farmers delhi government responsible for their safety and security farmers indian citizens and they came delhi show their disagreement new farming rules

my heart goes out farmers how brave they fighting brave n courageous
excellent we with our farmers full support from delhi kisan ekta zindabad
we marxist leninists always fight for students farmers and workers of world
please let me know why landless farmers protesting middlemen who will be most affected by procurement of produce outside mandis
no farmers
shekharji have overlooked real lesson we have learnt from this unfortunate episode that money raised by vested interests and shared with religious entities can be more powerful than will of people expressed electorally but for nexus between middlemen in punjab and gurdwaras financial support could not have mobilized oppose laws through protests on ground this dangerous development and country should be alerted this by journalists like
looks like indian freedom flight against britishers
5 lastly good amount of money farmer will get even in initial days can be used by farmer build secondary income like cattle farming poultry or processing plant etc or educating their children which will then create new breed of highly educated farmers
good evening sir if our crop production reduced due shades of beside farmer planted taku trees along side his field there any crop loss assessment can we get from him and which act that resolves my problem
this only for punjab and up elections
secret news leaked tikait anti bjp deal of 5 crore was made and upto now tikait some farmers leaders received 4 crores
also clearly written in new farm laws that in case of conflict farmer cannot go court that right there taking away constitutional rights of farmers
no support broker middleman mandi walas
actually farmers come out from apmc and they have right sell everywhere and they have participate with outside
1 mandi how mandi works they have middle men who buy from farmers at their own liked price not at price fixed by gov why this happens
these people not farmers they traders
moving from certain crops other depends on many factors saying that moving other crops like dalhan and tilhan which also covered under msp will be beneficial for all parties very one sided point of view what being said definitely right but in theory pulses and oil seeds need more taking care of especially from animals in my region there serious problem there serious problem of overpopulation of neel gaay from antelope family fencing and guarding does not help much with them as they huge and fast small herd can rampage and entire acre in few hours there so many such issues which deter farmer from planting certain crops and lack of government policy on such issues brings no solutions
hahahaha paid sarpanch of that village and some people nd still could not go there jgh reh support krn lag h kr rally
2 in case of ola or uber product used in transaction expensive possess i e car but in case of food items difficult do that as products cheap and relatively easy for farmer go and sell partial goods in retail market retailers will also adapt new challenges
knowing modi does not decisions based on elections
just think where rice for your biryani come from wheat for your roti come from if cow like your mother who give milk drink then farmer like your father who give rice and wheat eat
west bengal kishan with modi
india should reconsider decisions moditva should abrogate from india so indo pak relationship begins in good faith
congratulations farmers country with them
but this will do not cater problem of exploitation by buyers which will not buy produce at msp or above msp because new bills do not provide legal backing msp hence farmers protesting

that sdm highly paid official so does not concern him what or how those farmers struggling in real life and most others amongst non farming public
we can not sell in other states because many of farmers dont even have their own tractor so how can we afford cost of transportation
my father in law farmer in karnataka sells wherever price good apmc never pays msp because wholesale buyers never pay price cartel really true we never got what money and effort we put in apmc also pays after 60 days if my father in law sells directly then gets money in 15 days sometimes gets in 3 days getting money upfront saves his expense no one protesting in karnataka as we already have system sell outside apmc and in another district
4 after contract if prices up then farmers still have sell for least price and leads huge crruption and useful for brokers mediators and whoever have power
very simple lower msp of wheat paddy and raises for oilseeds and other items which being imported right now and balance in such way that farmers automatically diversify there crops
big thanks rajat sain and roohani this reel will glorify flowers of our india and all other countries punjabis and kissans
not farmers anymore
i am sorry i was quite annoyed with aa mitra by listening him in your 7 5 years of governance praising modi popularity left watching episode but day dare see this episode me 200 percent agree with thought of shri mitra many times i have indicated above opinions in my comment though i have voted bjp but never believe on them convey my regards and excellent analysis by abhijit ayyer mitra ji
1 if all farmers against this bill means they will not sell there produce private mandis then how can these private mandi can exploit them
govt repelled 3 farmers andolan just prevent sikh and hindu riots in punjab and other states due this andolan
modi has nothing do with hindus everyone watched his response post bengal hindu genoccide never spoken on hindus welfare support yogiji only one hindu openely supporter

i have watched this video more then 10 times whenever i do my answer writing on msp farm act 2020 apmc or any agricultural topic i prefer this lecture
wow this just amazing and on point information shoutout vice news i support farmers protest

hurting farmers how ask one question we cant answer nirmala sitharaman yes but also need get answers right

last and not least farmers saying they sold potato for rs 8 kg sold end user at 40 wrong all depend on demand and supply there season when rates so low that farmers have dump at any rate but also end user get benefit of paying less for same product
thank god that this protest brought people from all walks of life together for farmers
what will poor farmer achive marching delhi nonsense

sad farmers got nothing out of this because of their leaders ego
congress or khalistani sajis shame on such culprit sikhs
very informative video and fairly neutral thanks suggest update video based on present scenario wherein government has given assurance of msp further important points missed out like farmer free not get into agreement with private entities who could trap them in legalese this very key point that needs be stressed in my opinion
this victory of farmers unity
3 industrialization may not be agriculture itself but can surely improve life of lot of people who were in farming previously as will create job opportunities for millions come out of agriculture and shift into comparatively higher value manufacturing as service sector legendary bad at providing enough job opportunities especially population as large as ours i hope can relate india and agriculture though extremely important for life very bad as source of livelihood so we should focus at trying improve productivity of farmer so that less and less farmers can also feed nation and shift rest into comparatively higher value manufacturing industry
farmers going stay here
today consumer class silent apart from punjab and haryana big and small consumers in other states also supporting modi because they still have religion and nationalism in their mouths
its all about giving advantage big pvt players and know them shame mudi govt they did not leave our farmers
not just one state election election of punjab really really important gain power in that state stamp down khalistan movement
farmer should utilise law of self defence
best law great achievement for every farmers jaihind

we support farmers
question why did bihar farmers not switch pulses and other vegetables if apmc acts not there in bihar since 2006 and paddy price low
so my congratulations every single farmer and heartfelt condolences martyered ones
india rejecting bjp
central government should listen farmer
why sometimes onion became more than 100 per kilo and other vegetables at more than 50 per kilo simply logic of apmc does not stand msp here stay and violent agitation on some hypothetical assumption not acceptable thitrd why other states not forthcoming with agitation fourth punjab and haryana in grip of organized syndicates of big farmers and since they adversely affected they resort such violent agitation
what type of people bjpians when made laws agreed when repealed laws agreed do not have your own stand as individual be man not chaatukaaar
indian media does not show this either i really hope yall make out through this real soon lots of love and blessings from pak
at 4 00 i want point out there fallacy in comparison with munawar farmers saying that end of msp will be logical conclusion of laws no logic suggests that munawar if left alone would make joke that mp police arrested him for
going wrong with farmers
i knew that this farm bill issue not black or white but entirely grey thanks for covering i would like show this my friends
your discussion was not only illuminating but also inspiring three farm laws as on today stand scrapped have endorsed my hunch that agitation basically engineers by rich farmers and middlemen especially from punjab and haryana missed one point that kerala essentially socialist state never legislated apmc act hence farmers did not have offer their produce at designated marketplaces licensed middlemen one reason could have been kerala was not into subsistence farming of paddy other reason was must have been political which that entire focus of supporting farmers was farmers of punjab and haryana may be because people who represented farming interests at centre were basically from these two states so economic and political focus of green revolution was centred on these two states i would say partisan approach national issue if farmers from other states were similarly engaged there was no reason why they could not have risen occasion again there no reason why 88 and 70 of national procurement of paddy and wheat should happen from punjab and haryana time centre distributed its procurement more equitably among all indian states this will immensely benefit punjab and haryana as their farmers will shift focus other crops thereby reducing ecological burden on these states of growing rice and wheat
if govt withdraws farm laws what next what takait goons plans for improvement of farmers planning new storage facilities new markets new crops new connectivity new method of disbursing payment they going give up subsidies fertilizer electricty
not every farmer happy with this decision shame on pn and haryana farmers
why only kisan male showing up in your video thumbnail in world of equality cannot we show both male and female farmer
beautiful dear nice job god bless for teaching new kisan bill
this my first time commenting i new subscriber and i just found your channel i have few friends in india and i plan on coming visit india when pandemic has changed or over with as american i found india television be quite different read very strange and odd thank so much for explaining this farm bill did excellent job and i also love your humor especially when cough and said pakistan real fast that was very funny i look forward seeing more of your videos and please know that your audience not just india but worldwide in fact i think have quite few americans who enjoy watching your channel too up good work
was much needed considering what going on in punjab no one focusing on what exactly happening in bills clarity much required
every people gonna effect from these bill i am also farmer and i also own 15 acers of farm land and i also go farmers protest after 1 week support farmers
700 died hahahaha thats 2 per day toady 20th november 2012 please give names of 40 farmers who died this month lol
rich farmers of two states got decide fate of poor farmers across india that exactly how democracy should work right
they wanted make violence our farmers sensible and responsible but misled by anti national elements wishing for farm law problem resolve soon
first change rule life indian farmar should upgrade as today market scenario they at least think why most of intellectual person supports this bill and some of them not even in bjp in democracy too difficult reforms we cannot compite world by old method and old technology farming should be respectful income source not compulsion
godi media might not report this but this protest gives me hope that all not lost in our country
i respect chairman of rajyasabha and deputy speaker but has allowed and facilitated parliamentary democracy be murdered at both instances passing and repealed of farm laws better resign than follow orders
farmers need store their commodity for atleast two months
bjp supporter in me turned into indian again
2 farmers can sell nationwide
farmers should withdraw their protest on 3 farm laws because as per pm these laws good for farmers so let them try and live with these laws and if there any problem after year or so they can start fresh agitation pointing real problem evidenced then govt cannot turn blind eye towards farmers
but farmers will not go back till msp covered under law despite having repealed these laws as said by bku leader
love singh nation khalistan zindabad love from lahore pakistan
in end i want thanks bbc and other media for supporting i mean reporting farmers protest right from beginning this success belongs u also
exceptional this movement unparallel in history leaders and farmers and all supporters will get there due respect your hardwork will never fail however hard govt tries malign with today mann baat of pm has proved country how many agreed with him they have disabled their likes and dislike dear farmers country stands with praying god every moment give courage stand against these goons strong
foolish farmers of india
i want see reaction of bjp supporters of facing these factual realities advice beware of people who still supporting bjp because they do not know difference between right and wrong they selfish and mean so its good time know and filter people around u
would be better this congress goes mone vart rest of life its best thing this haramkhor can do for people of india
should be promoted farmers shud be in farms and not on roads disturbing life of common people

these rules very helpful for my family bcs we small farmer
modi very egoistic person must be having some other plans screw unsuspecting farmers
very candid opinion on modi and bjp
there nothing controversial about farm laws brought by modi govt ironically these farm laws were in election manifesto of very political parties who opposing them now these farm laws sacred solely aimed at benefiting real farmers not goons watch on tv who disguised as farmers murdering raping destroying law order wrecking havoc in name of protest this mayhem only limited 3 northern states of punjab haryana western part of uttar pradesh farmers of rest of country have no problems about these laws because these laws will potentially eliminate middle men who taking away major portion of farmers income from agricultural produce elaborate propaganda run by opposition parties in india aimed at defaming modi india because they could not defeat modi in elections they will never defeat him in future too bbc star endorser of these types of fake agitations because they paid ton load of money anti india forces like china pakistan khalistanis heavily invested in these types of fake agitations opposition parties in india fully cooperating with such forces they want destabilize country they doing quite well so far i shocked see comments here in support of this fake agitation makes me realize how effectively this malicious propaganda being run managed no one knows truth they peddling lies after lies these same people ran fake black lives matter campaign which was sham by way

rakesh has expose himself badly again if again goes for election people will give him less than 1000 votes sad see government has repealed reformist laws aim for poor farmers god bless india
congratulations all farmers and specially tribute those who lost their life in this battle of livelihood
farmers agitation getting support from all corners of society success eminent now
unfortunately sg this lecture in english farmers in punjab haryana wont be able understand easily sir make available in hindi ultimate
i will tell ground reality of farmer protests
punjab just fulfilling requirements of wheat and rice for whole india but couldnt do enough for itself
repealing decision can be done in different way by using dummy politics safe image of india not laid down infront of protestor either right or wrong demand from them there must be executive and judicial system as well balance this mistake this gives caa protestor protests and get whatever they wanted
stand with farmers
there videos of these so called farmers beating people death why only punjab haryana rest of farmers on their fields
finally modi ji showed his real face
doing last govt change his rubbish decision on farmer rights
right bjp modi amit shah yogi desh drohi
i am here after repealing of farm bill
from this i am getting feeling that farmers r not one who actually protesting but buyers of these farmers making them protest stating that farm laws will lead them bad conditions may b
few years back 2006 these were implemented in bihar have they progressed mandi nhi kisaano paas option nhi bechega fasal msp nhi milti
simple india for sale people against this sale
7 40 these informal credit systems based on trust developed over decades yes so please be patient and give formal systems half decade be implemented results will be there see reason these farm laws have been brought up so early in 5 years of this govt that there 4 years before next general elections these laws would start bearing fruit and farmers 6 only of total who protesting over msp will have no reason complain by then i not big fan of any party but these bjp people politically smart and they actually do things they say they will do
indian government might not be supporting farmers but all true indians supporting our indian farmer brothers jai jawan jai kisaan jai hind
shame on bjp government since 60 days past they cannot decission do not blame farmers they half brain with frustration why such government wait till datr
ravish kumar real indian looks for his country 2nd man was also very nice blaming taliban without knowing them foolishness they r gd people they want shariya in their country and want gv women their rights according islam but in previous reign they were unable do that coz they had fight with other groups generated by usa and india
since congress was very communist begin with this bjp very capitalistic
why would farmer travel inter state sell his produce knows that if his produce perishable then needs sell nearby as quickly as possible so then middlemen or traders can sell retails and consumers think farmer like mr bill gates that if give him freedom will become billionaire really think traders will not exploit them outside regulated market like apmc and farmer corporate body with many departments like marketing and sales that can go anywhere and sell his produce at best price this will be helpful big farmers but will affect small farmers and that onion thing utter nonsense how can allow so many middlemen and traders just exploit prices of commodities way they want that needs be regulated as well
i just want ask them where were when farm laws and government need your support
i see clear path victory for in punjab
minister making bombastic threatening statements his son providing muscle dispatch all opposition smithereens police working hand in glove with perpetrators godi media making wild accusations
this farmers awakeness big effect on consumers so we should support our farmers
congrats farmers and their leaders
such big blow farmers withdrawal of farm laws again poor farmers targeted now we not sure how long these farmers have wait come out of there issues and lead good life i was so happy that government was firm on farm laws till 19 11 2021 if for election then not good decision if due khalistani elements they have already done lot of atrocities in that last 12 months i am not sure what more they going do but i was not convinced on fact that removed for elections but we will have wait for few more days get full information

sir gujarat farmer and pepsico wla case ko bhe smjhae
we lack terribly in holding fort ourselves in protecting family friends neighborhood state nation and worlds sanctity lack of inclusion of culture and ethics in our teachings under guise of secularism this allows easily fall prey any sort of lure and we in turn try find appeasement in search of alternatives in looking for luxury and laze each child needs healthy and strong mind lure of wealth need not move him her best way child learns i hear by aping so owness falls on shoulders if parents which means that parents have follow path if righteousness this easy say i am aware we have stop fraudulent and easy lifestyle and stop falling prey all sorts of appeasement difficult but let all pledge begin one modi cannot bring about much required change we need be good civilians administrators strong and upright armed forces judiciary all and sundry ready lay our lives if required not only on our borders but also in our homes neighborhoods states and nations with target of vasudeva kutumbakam do not think that little youtubers were already warning of groups of people wanting be and remain rich by controllingthe masses we can already see our weak indian structure easily falling down around everyday not one desh bhakt was found ready lay his life without thought of consequences and not let any other flag be raized on lal kila indian monument on indian land shame on indians
modi pranked nation badly nation lost and reapeal will damage punjab and haryana more than anyone if reforms can back by anarchy tjen nations progress in danger
news channels should explain farm bills like this thank sir jai hind
pls support our farmers
now farmers have negotiating power in mandis we have seen farmers throwing on roads when price of tomato crashed less than rupee at mandis they could not even recover transportation cost where was negotiating power now mandi cartel decides what rate if existing system so good or just good why farmers committing suicide oppose for sake of opposing or opposing itself opportunity make money
true god died 4 all our sins n arose on 3 rd day billions believe him n sure in heaven yet some reject
why modi government turning deaf ear plight of farmers
no food no life we support farmer
first and foremost we must think that who protesting obviously our farmers in country if either soldiers or farmers protest means something fishy going
but currently our politicians extreme corrupt they increase their salaries at any time in parliament but do not want increase income of farmers they got fund from corporate then why govt or politician think about of farmers income growth
btw i also belong farmer family in neighbouring state
india with farmers
first of all please tell me what were those 3 laws that was introduced by govt of india nda none of know if so then do not know what do with untill saw them protesting i have no proof that they were not farmers but do have proof that they were farmers if so then who was growing those fruits vegetables food grains and more if all in majority of them were at protest guys know nothing neither those people who were protesting and rakesh tikkait seems be politician more than farmer this being done all because of money and money which paid them by parties and international groups and these media have no work instead of spreading poison they have ruined lives of people more than making good both oppostion and government and involved in this mutually and alp there way rule country and making people fool as i can see all getting too neither win of farmers so called nor defeat of rulling party nda all politics
if kisans dont want end agitation let them continue kisans form part of country tikait awaits orders from congress end andolan
i support farmers but this happened on indias independence day thats what wrong do specially what happened at red fort kinda reminds me of trump supporters trashing capitol building
i am farmer too and i strongly supported farm laws but impossible explain certain sector of farmers as they lack education now taliban should over india if caa not back right poor farmers in audi and bmw were seen protesting
we all stand with farmer
there could be short possibly few weeks high intensity conflicts with either pakistan or china or both out pok and bjp does not want additional domestic front open in delhi that can cause anarchy
did even read farm laws do even know that people who protesting in india rich middlemen who commission from small farmers do know that laws actually prohibits large corporate companies from monopolising agriculture industry in india farmers do not have pay any tax but now commission agents will have pay hence this protest by way only 2 states protesting all farmers in other states of india not so i conclude know nothin jon snow
why do we have such good mortality against covid something done by government no our food habits but soon thats all gonna be dream after contract farming
very disappointing that due political interest farmers has been again pushed back trap of middle men and polical leaders having tie up with them regressive
people should stand together i hope people in india stand together against this reform because if people do not this will spread rest of in world we stronger together than against
dumi adhigrahan law failed in 2014 so modi has brought new farm bill in 2020 modi himself asked central government when manmohan singh sir pm at that time law for msp according swaminathan commity c2 50 formula but now u turn unlimited stock of food grain equal raise price of food grain for command people and huge profit stockest
we support farmers rightful agitation against draconian new farm bill
sikhs of world u lions of india do not back down stand ur ground demand khalistan
supportfarmer againstthisprotest
probably mr khattar havent read history well and do not know fact that haryana was part of punjab itself now that haryana different state does not mean that farmers will divide their outlook unlike bjp government wants
farmer should call off protest now
2 empowerment and protection agreement on price assistance and farm services act 1 enable contract farming eg e choupal 2 price assurance even before sowing 3 if higher mp entitled than one in contract 4 transfer risk of market unpredictability due prior price determination 5 access modern technology better seeds and inputs due investment by private companies 6 reduced cost of marketing due assured sale 7 effective dispute resolution with clear time of redressal 8 impetus r d in agri sector 9 clarification farmer will have full power in contract fix sp empowering farmers fpos will help local dsr and no need go court issues 1 farmers not empowered or educated negotiate with corporate sector 2 inputs like seeds fertiliser etc might come under corporate hegemony 3 corporarisation might bring uniformity ruining diversity of agro practices in different parts 4 exploration of farmers 5 economy of scale required but 85 farmers
hope others also understand this looks that farmers will be really benefited and farming becomes profitable business
first of all stop calling them farmers they not farmers
they all r not farmers
free khalistan from india
thanks against farmers u give great misleading information
good decision by modi ji
law 2 also not issue as there many companies in contract with farmer like pepsico nestle itc hul new farmer bill will provide more wide range and with abiding new law farmers can have contract with private companies with higher profits
please i request international media this protest as far as possible indian media has been bought by government and large corporates of india
farmers won india won bjp lost
farmers doing protest peacefully they did nothing and still welcomed with tear gas
government opposition farmers union and media bhaand sbse farm bill baare me suna but hr trf propeganda prejudice misinformation hi sunne ko mila pr pr factual information hindi me mili aasan bhasha me smjhane aapka aabhar
govt should acknowledge its mistake and death of farmers more than 700 martyred farmers families should be compensated
godi media levl decreasing every day
government should define legal laws in simple way that farmers can understand which all private companies should understand
no food no farmers
was really hoping for vice cover these protests winter season in north india and in capital temperature regularly drops 5 degrees these farmers get shot at by tear gas and water cannons in this weather there huge risk of covid outbreak as well and yet government just will not listen all moves these days benefit big industrial families farmers did not ask for these reforms and government simply creating problems provide solution
sikhs no longer stand at borders for india as though but now all know they stand at borders protect punjab but if anyone gets past delhi indias own problem no khalistan problem foreign investment for khalistan shall be n ira billions as we have over block chain and creating cryptos that will all banks and invaders at bay we too smart for world just ask britain government how very clever sikhs we build our wealth and now have deepest pockets over economies and close them down
nice for farmer use
rakesh tikait great farmer leader like his honourable father
police man who beating old farmer not son of his real father harram pila
farmers holded good debate they answering all question nd totaly well informed
government should not allow hoarding of crops pulses as small farmers without quantity or storage would be vulnerable also make msp legally binding in contract farming too
salute all farmers
we support farm law and bjp government
but farmers not understanding this
farmers congress and shocked
nothing but fooling nation everybody only trying prove which gang or which party criminals were rather than immediately finding truth and punishing criminals considering anti farmer attitude that new urban and social media india has these incidents happening not surprising not sure whether modi and yogi brigade considers this as great achievement of developing up
repeal laws of kisan dont want
those farmers laws not draconian in nature actually exactly opposite those laws boon farmers
does really takes year understand demands of farmers such pity on this government
hardliners will see modi as weak and support for yogi be next big hindu leader will increase finally modi gave opposition something celebrate
red salute comrades on farmers march
mukesh ambani ko khush krny leay modi bhen chod ny kia farmer act i am standing with punjab farmers
lies of dump of modiji please go out from post of pm along with yourselves
we support farmers and yes was good idea show your strength and should have burnt down red fort
we have industrialise rural india we have reduce area under crops maintain demand for farm produce as taiwan south corea and israel have done china also which name these days we do not like at all
only discussed selective issues which in favour of so called farmers laws have many good provisions as well i think issues should be discussed holistically free from bias any stakeholder
we with our farmers
who here after farm laws repealed
farmers r working in fields not protesting all foreign funding unrest in india these things r happening
as far as i am concerned i am disappointed that laws were repealed but then who am i complaint i am not farmer
tv media dying people shifting individual repoters of social media zee nothing but loyal pet of govt
beating farmer with stick what called security
shame on indian police throwing stones and beating peacefully protesting farmera
congratulations farmers
dock media should reach modi on this message
if agriculture subject state how could central government make laws on apart from that without gurrrenty minimum support price how can double income of farmers
wrong message and wrong time this only shows that no matter win by huge majority still cannot pass any bills or laws if there protests by negative forces with ulterior motives huge loss of face and demonstration of weakness by modi for bending down khalistanis calling themselves farmers very dangerous precedent
my condolences those 700 farmers who lost thr life while protesting
but when did list out benefits of new farm bills
guys watch faye desouza discussion with p sainath addressed all three perils of this bill which meghnad presented as pros here 1 destruction of apmcs 2 what contract farming did our farmers and our food crops across country 3 essential commodities act removal now also means black marketing and hoarding in addition what happening with lack of msp this total mess
with this move bjp might not win next loksabha election
we supports farmers
has vox covered role of middlemen in previous laws and how they squeeze farmers and how new laws them out of this squeeze if not covered then sony propoganda both views should be given
this triseries damn good gonna recommend everybody who argue that farmers wrong
should not generalise farmers of whole country for some so called farmers who have done anything wrong
but in end of day farmers who decide which system they want continue by selling their products apmc they can apmc alive and kill bill why protest for parallel ecosystem where boosts economy for building up new food processing industries
but let wait for his next innovative steps for welfare of farmers
time for modi repeal himself and move back let yogi amit shah himanta etc step up and up leadership regain confidence and not be afraid tough decisions for country
2 how easy will be deal with corporate even for group of farmers
farmers had lack of commercial education about agriculture investment and technology then farms laws showed farmers leave agriculture sector but today farmers showed they becoming educated this very good big revolution as 21st century demands for india on way
we support modiji let each state decide what they want some gunda states andcfactions trying control label every states agricultural products and then electorate will show how much laws required
first of all my sincere respect and support farmers
ome farmer died and no police mem were died but both were injured and that men died tldue gun shot go and saw his photo due which lost his balance on tractor
this jahil ticket and his group will not stop untill they get focus and election ticket thier sponsorers giving money for this expensive agitation do not want stop this agitation most farmers against this protest like if these rich jahil farmers do not leave border court must intervine and kick these idiots out of our delhi border
frauds its not broker pay tax farmer pays tax brokers buying from farmers less price if sell outside will get good price 10 janpath salve stop this nonsense
plus green revolution happened because farmers income increased immediately but this time while shifting some sort of organic farming farmers reluctant cause only thing they seeing drastic change without changing their earnings
so in short agriculture sector was in shit and current govt reform pissed off farmers even more
kisan andolan matlab sajish this could be part of conspiracy get political benifits against yogiji
i support my farmers
most of these protestors do not know 3 farm laws and most important these farmers also citizens they should do this protest peacefully what they did in 26 jan shameful act if they civilised then they should do protest in civilised manner that all
farmers protest
i see lot of people grieving here i want ask one thing lets say bunch of ignorant people farmers out of which majority does their work honestly and actually contributing something good for their community now out of courtesy and kind of power have want do something good for their future cause they have been denied of good returns for their work come up with plan from people policy makers bureaucrats with extensive knowledge about agriculture and farmers would just supress farmers accept those reforms or just will advise your reformers explain what those reforms and how can benefit in long run cause have power would not let opposition debate on this that fine galat hi bolenge but how about live debate with few leaders of these farmers and stream for all people around country so that each person can see what actually going on
bjp smjh gya promoter and supporter follower km pdne laga kanoon wapas lena pda
democracy of 90 years of afganistan should not be given chance against taliban because
big fan of ak but want clarification as raghav sir told on tv debate that we did not pass 3 bills in delhi so delhi farmers not protesting
well planned step by rss they asking more than msp govt will finally agree pass law and then drums will roar saying rss has helped farmers
subse tractor rally owl gandhi ne nikali all these people should be arrested they have provoked these people
interest of farmer some food not full list
like imran khan legalized tlp modi g should also legalise khalistan
with budget people not happy but godi media very happy
i was touched see farmers growing crops on side of road once farmer always farmer salute sirji
thanks modiji these laws were dangerous for all farmers
omg pardon me for voting bjp in last elections on behest of badal dal
let me get this right govt doesnt have political will and unable provide food and opportunities poor during effen pandemic but they had time blindside everyone and pass farm bills
as farmers if we still dependent on company govt solve our problems would never happen lets do ourselves lets come together create fpo with no entry for politics inside make sure benefits farmers with policies created by farmers policy makers never farmers and they never understand ground reality so let farmers make themselves and contain locally
i am continously watching indian media crying repenting spreading hate against pakistan taliban like they become restless after this victory plz focus on your own issues then show involvement in other matters
never forsake your farmers as they ones who care about your country most and they know how force change when they want unlike city folk
this actually one type of politics some countries supporting like america rusia all they r playing actually and trying destroy our india supporter
3rd bill very dengerous for every indian
rahul kanwal best very honest and unbiased journalist i thought india today also leftist channel funded by jehadis missionaries and congress but rahul kanwal won my heart this time all very best
all farmers who supporting this and those who did not support this
after one years of farmers protest
so media there not raise voice for farmers but for there damn trp
waste modi farm bills 2020
save farmers save food save humanity
modi did right modi needs sikhs regiment for china front there was rebel goin on in sikh regiment as well modi will bring back bill in diff form
miserable condition for india but that tractor drifting skill one helluva ride
election bill fir ayega
this win not only of farmers but tight slap democracy villian like kangana godi medias today my respect for gandhian philosophy increased salute our nation annadata jai jawan jai kisan jai vigyan
also congress when not in power n govt passes bill tht benefits citizens no dead warrant for citizens
when dont listen your people or give them some kind of positive feedback people bound lose patience however in this regard i suspect some troublemaking hooligans were paid incite protesters by becoming violent i wish our leaders behaved in more responsible manner ofcourse they saw this coming that why most of media channels have been broadcasting farmers protests in poor light why cannot modi government repeal these laws these laws above human lives and nations peace modernisation and economy so important that will disregard that its these farmers who working hard day and night bring out these crops if protesters were provided with proper channels exhibit their protesters and not made sit outside delhi for months in cold then other political parties with vested interests would not have used them as way of creating trouble this protest meant be voice of only farmers and meant peaceful when riots were breaking out where were our leaders hiding if they had let them in and spoken them would this have happened violence not justified in form but incitement violence and pushing someone too far form of crime in itself how can progress in country where leaders not sensitive and compassionate towards its farmers
haryana lots of love from punjab
my great salutes incredible indian farmers thanks so much with my humble regards i highly obliged all of
modi uneducated and has destructed whole country my heart bleeds that punjabi cannot go their own capital this not democracy

bjp must read history before messing with punjab
tenant farmers unable sale their corps at msp coz they landless they cultivate land of others by borrowing money from private source
farmers adamant not ready come compromise especially farmers from punjab they arrogant basically they more rich than farmers from other states
has given opportunity where farmers have right sell their produce in any market across india which also includes apmc
i proud of my prime minister jai hind jai modi ji
farmers protested very peacefully for long period but government did not heed their needs many farmers died due cold weather conditions
c other than punjab and haryana no other state charge district fees and market cess and they charge only commision
farmers reduce their production volume 1 better land owners cultivate only in quarter land reduce availability of products and make life hell in urban living then blind rulers open their eyes
please also protest for farmer workers minimum wage up 20000 per month all hard work done by employees not rich kidd farmers
farmers of view that reforms were made only for benefit of few and they were going suffer most as result of such reforms
why indian farmers carrying canadian flag
more than 150 precious indian farmers loss their life due peaceful protest poor bjp goverment unable find solution suffering people in india modi has sold india ambani adani bjp under collapse
there case be made against notion that farmers will increase prices when demand increases in current apmc situation apmc has buy products but there no such binding on private players has so happened in past that private companies declined buy from farmers causing their produce perish
everyone telling we support farmer support ghar baath krr log delhi mien protest mien help krro

this what when our ancestors said that everyone gets what they deserve no point of feeling sad about farmers hardships anymore
very good review most so called protesters n farmers do not know any of these things teaching them should be priority
modi will find ways distract indians will need create some more border wars
what about initial part of video where those suv were literally running over group pf walking farmers from behind whats this kind of reporting nt u guys even lil ashamed
farm laws nhi repeal dikkat aur dikkat band chutiyaps bhot imp issues country agar yaad unenployment suddenly issue hi nhi opposition walon
today black day of our democracy they insulted our flag in name of farmers they sponsored terrorists jhande ko bachane veer 100 saal ladai giraye log they insulted soul our freedom fighters and army log sahid shoot at sight
congratulations anchor of this video one day will get award from modi forget what they did india and focusing on one side of farm bill entry of yourself in farmer protest was one sided forgetting meaning of india also your channel ahead bs fursat me nikal zee news aajtak offer hi modi chamche funding how this bill passed why they pass this bill during covid 19 think logically not only for getting subscribers of modi fans
agriculture bill ham farmers ko accept hi nhi aakhir ham thopa ham farmer protest
even comments below talking about caa nrc so farmers need hijacked caa nrc etc
i from india and i farmer in punjab state
infact abhijit analysis hogwash because bjp was anyway on its way win up and in punjab they never stood chance this decision has zero electoral benefit
first time in my lifetime disappointed me modi ji
who thinks this will help farmers u will regret i framer and i read bills these will definately ruin will make slaves
rakesh tikat jindabadd
right thing do agricultural reforms cannot be done by forcing shock on system and people these reforms required but has be done by supporting farmers become efficient
nation who abuses its farmers has very bleak future
capitalist contract farming capital accumulation and exploitation of farming society contractors prices low maximise profits 1998 deregulated indian sugar industry did not improve farmers income pursuit of profit drives corporates more than notion of public interest or democracy
we nation stand in support with farmers
feeling too sad about today modi decision of withdrawal repeal farm acts
30 of our farmer brothers died due harsh winters on streets one sant baba ram singh sacrificed his life by seeing pain of farmers i support my farmers and i from up india
i tried understand farm bills from many videous
pm modiji right in repealing farm laws there time stick your neck out there also time behave in more sober manner
what about farmers who died while protesting
in mean time also assure no anti social element tries advantage of our farmers
this reddy seems like spokesperson of bjp and not farmers
fair deal farmers can be by way of having shares in stock grains holding company so that both can advantage of escalation of produced goods alternatively farmer unions can build store house using public private model important for any model succeed leadership should be of highest integrity we lost true leaders that why we in mess time we realize importance of leaders like ram rahim aasa ram and other prominent grass root leaders who have been silenced due petty reasons which even not proven do not destroy what cannot create
wheat and rice and other agriculture products depend on market that reality that why only rice and wheat farmer protesting what remember rate down if competition grows look at bihar rate down after finishing mandi act and consumers get cheap products
haths off effort being put in beautifully portray core reasons of farmerprotest
modi actually showed that do anarchy and get whatever want and has no bones how will fight china cannot controle anarchy in his own country let be shahin baugh or farmer uprise
farmers dying because of this type of politics
criminal netaas ambition not for long they in power till their lost breath not at all but farmers community will be there feed
1 does bill act 1 if farmer decides sell his produce some organization not apmc will be guaranteed minimum support price
instead of farmers bills long over due government should pass law death for corruption as in china has this government got courage pass such bill
be honest i have been watching your channel since over year cut clutter national interest specifically think were neutral quite clear where stood i was abroad then last few months not taking stand becoming wee bit like godi media sort of then forget we have enough mainstream channels doing that
we support farmers
3 laws pass implement hi nhi phir kisan buri haalat h jimmedar congress h ticket h
now farmers have well knowledge now they will never batoo may nhi aye ga kabi bu
my question here where taliban terrorist group that calling themselves as jihadist getting such weapons
please make video about rising petrol fuel prices no media noticing
police clash farmers
i am neutral person supporting what right rather than spreading hatred concept of free trading good its good things liberal but at same time we need look into fact so that farmers not pushed poverty government can also definitely encourage private companies provide agricultural consultancy based on mutual consent of buyer and seller but with strong regulations supporting farmers and their development
loved lecture and content related technicalities of farm laws also i am happy that vikas sir prediction about farm laws that they will stay and modi will not repeal failed very knowledgeable person but yes we all sometimes undermines power of protests
these big farmers or called them zamindar who only protest against farm laws
reform crying need of time with slight changes which govt also trying modify but rejecting bill going push farmers in same gutterwhere we will say lays 10 me 2 aloo deta aur bechare kisaan 1 kilo 5 benefit peace
and shopkeepers not speak of small farmers
always win why should government fight for farmers when they wont fight for themselves and in turn lose elections and then whole country loses
if msp made law then traders will have pay and not government bjp protecting traders and not farmers
bharat ak hi padosi samarthak afganistan charo taraf padosi dushman modi taliban dar dikhayega hinduo ko
unbiased news pros and cons of these bills explained without any kind of political inclination that what expected from media superb
nice from punjab india doctor inderjit singh
no protection for farmers general public
sir why did not mention current 4 5 commission levied by mandi agents in punjab and tax levied by state govt in mandi that these bills sought remove that reason for agitations by mandi owners and middle man
how about rest of farmers we certainty do not trust mandi system we do not give damn what punjab haryana thinks we also farmers and we will not let mandis have their monopoly we will protest again against repeal
congrats all farmers
modi ji udas lag h i with u sir till my last breathe our pm our pride
we support modi
kisan all will be successful soon all india love
thank this exactly what i was looking for last evening understand farm bill better before passing any judgements comments this was helpful and its strange that no news channel or website has put effort into explaining
rioters and brokers won nation and poor farmers failed
i support my dear farmers
this treason these not farmers they terrorist and should be tried as such
because of uas government support them else there might not be any name like taliban
thanks sir for supporting farmers
at same time fact that people all on side of farmers
real problem that in all cases where regulatory bodies functional both parties literate but in farmers case one literate corporate other illetrate farmers that why govt in no mood accept his mistake
and hence i think all depends on farmer what they want do bill not detrimental farmers in any way middlemen state govt will lose their money that
now kissan leaders misleading farmers
not easy stuff defeat 3 lakhs soldiers people of afghanistan also supports taliban
we ashemed of our denior leader rajyasavha member they donot have respect of parlament as them why i can not sell my product openly inmarket when can buy anywhrw by my choice only farmer can not sell
abp stopped showing farmers news after godi call biki media
china should support india farmers forever
damn that means about 1 out of 12 humans indian farmer
1 because of private sectors farmers will get better prices and farmers income will double
pm narendra modi has been repealed three farmer law on occasion of guru nanak jayanti
i support bill
this show hysterical how dare comment about national security when sons of kisans protect border of india
5 who at loss due this farm bills of 2020
thank your farmers or will see why
happened in india where ramrajya rss bhaktas very dangerous humanity once upon i am proud of india which peaceful than many countries but in bjp rule this trust has destroyed people of india need learn from this we must throw bjp and congress must support regional parties from every states they only atleast think about some how
but why did anchor call him ex congress minister and not bjp minister come on ndtv we like dont do like
i am with indian farmers
as long as central govt does not collude with private companies i think these reforms good for farmers freedom
withdrawal of 3 farmers amendment act not lose bhagawan shri modi ji and his government but that all most all loses small or big farmers of india dark souls given disturbance government of india by name of true saints farmers market
also many people commenting on how this bill will away there right go court in case of dispute but truth this bill provides proper legal framework that being created protect farmers of india and not big private companies
informative video but why did not mention issue of minimum support price if commodities removed from essential commodities list will companies not be at liberty push down buying price of these commodities breaking point purchase them from farmers at lowest price possible companies may then sell these commodities at increasing prices in market but that does not necessarily mean that farmers will earn more
almost everyone says opening up market good looks like farmers also not concerned about but they more worried abt msp chances of dealing with big corporates possible disruption of existing systems sell their produces and hence temporary difficulties they might face logically opening up best way get everyone involved fair deal but just opening without proper support system only going favor big corporates bcs they well informed and always prepared there should be support systems for guiding farmers from switching from wheat others or helping them in dealing with big corporates also government should facilitate start ups with innovative ideas revolutionize farming like using technology and focus should be in those areas while opening up rather than helping corporates with money and muscle power find new blue ocean government stubbornness and rush probably making farmers suspicious reliance acquiring big bazar tata buying big basket and its hard believe these just coincidences so if someone has doubts on these reforms they not unfounded
govt should arrest tiket on tada act culprit who wants burn india lets all indians come forward and give one way ticket rakesh tiket jai hind
congress party idea of showing rahul and priyanka gandhi as center face good idea but not sure if will work fight bjp

please make one more video on farm bill
congratulations all farmers
historical victory for farmers
mark pm words carefully has called farm laws as good for farmers mentioned govt inability convince section of farmers about same apologized all countrymen not agitating farmers said laws were brought in interest of farmers but were being repealed in interest of nation multi factorial decision only pm can be aware of all relevant factors for decision will not be appropriate for anybody else pass judgement opinions can vary
if bjp looses elections then soul of farmers who died will rest in peace farmers back bone of our country
what happened was clear case of communication gap and misunderstanding protest was going on peacefully but then there came third party that tried fuel up moment they tried agitate farmers due which attack started police also reciprocated and result was total chaos what happened was very inhuman and disrespectful this could have been done with more patient and wisdom by both sides very saddening
farmers demands genuine appreciate your efforts show real things happening out there
govt ko sakat action against socold kisan very soon had gai yaar
this again what true grassroots movement of people by people for people looks like these farmers true heroes
samdish love way gave respect farmer for
sg on front foot farm laws were good and most of india had no problem with that evident from lack of protests in most of country could not govt have changed nature of laws allowing states implement as they wish they should have caa and nrc rules have yet be framed and even labour laws which country badly needs yet see light of implementation its up pm show some spine and get these two good laws going
herein bangalore karnataka bjp desided not allow farmers city ndtv kindly cover
drishti ias youtube channel which went through detailed analysis of farm bill 3 hr vedio and bill suggest that farmers can cell there produce mandi and also decide cost of produce
great video thx so consensus i can arrive at based on this information this farm bill not comprehensive and lacks application of thought my thought simply this if today with all tech and knowledge and experience we have gained we cannot care of farmers and bring down prices on essential and non essential items depressing and really sad i have great expectations from this govt i sincerely hope we as nation work towards solving all gaps and redraft this make more comprehensive ensure corporates dont play with 50 and 100 which i guarantee that any company will do further i dont see how this will stop hoarding in our country where our judicial system forever resolve cases how much peace will bring farmers most of who have not been able get even basic education busy feeding our country have legal contract i dont see this solution problems faced today if anything seems only making bigger mess
farmers income should rise imo pls explain abt pros and cons in layman language some one literate and knowledgeable pls apmcs storage ration msps did help but will they be required in future most of farmers poor explain frm environmen t conservative social societal and modern points of view
this when godi media shows false image of farmer protest sold media bjp cell
for farmers i would say dont create chaos in city let govt function when govt remove msp then we will do protest
sabko pta these chanel godi media republic tv aajtak abp india today zee news 18 tv9 etc
totally acceptable if farmers do protest for something if they do not like about government
i believe this wise move by bjp and pm modi i would encourage government go further one step and repeal all subsidies that in actual fact benefit middle man and unscrupulous landlords let each individual states sort their own subsidies for their farmers in absence of reforms let see how long these farmers want continue with their stupidity and opposition when their pocket books start really hurts furthermore unfair for rest of country foot subsidy bills for states that opposed farm reform bills who think they know better how run their farming industry all states that supported farm reform bills should be encouraged enact law for their states formalise new laws and look towards creating common market unions among these states for benefit of their farmers
people should be wise while voting because what spoken today if same thought was thought almost one year back about farmers there would not have been so many deaths among farmers now reason forthcoming elections farmers as well as other citizens must be very careful in voting and selecting their leader one should not believe in floral speeches floral speeches given when something behind we pray that god bless our country citizens with god wisdom and not human wisdom after so many farmers being killed wives lost their husbands husbands lost their wives children lost their fathers and mothers how can leader of our country replace these losses and forgetting all these things giving such floral speeches will not help people god bless our country
we stand with we will not forget what happened at golden temple in 1984 khalistan answer freedom from india oppression
thanks thanks lot media for representing farmers worldwide please cover all footage of farmer protest
glad u were not biased on your we just need unbiased news in these times if there proper regulation of this with farmers not being advantage of then i tnk farmers will be hugely benefitted by this bill
one big problem with bjp that they expect too much sacrifice from masses demonetization motor vehicle amendment act raising fines compulsory fastags fuel prices etc etc i would be comfortable if there equal sacrifice by ruling elites but their perks increasing 6th 7th pay commission increasing sarkari salaries without any substantial increase in productivity
farming lose making business for farmer if they will not get proper selling price then all farmer will quit doing farming then what will eat
now farmers terrorists wah modi wah
2 new design will eventually replace arhtiyas middleman with corporations farmers esp small farmers have some say in negotiations with middleman because of social and local political factors they can work with local sarpanch mlas etc who have benefit in helping local farmers in case of corporations do think small farmer can fight court case when corporation promises 50 rs kg for onions before sowing but gives only 5 rs kg after cultivation citing factors like its too much moisture not good quality etc etc
i support farmer protests i also supported caa protests they all work as star pracharak events for modi and bjp because these protests create strong feelings of nationalism among common people which normally remain dormant of india and make bjp stronger these protests also work as filter that clearly separate out who for country and who against
well explained reform looks good in paper but opening up market private players does not guarantee and smooth transaction issues of apmc price management can also pop up when big private corps step in similarly misuse in contract farming can also be suppressive farmers farm laws arnt perfect however they could have been sent parliamentary standing committee before being passed hastily without in depth expert inputs
modi has stuck with some of his toughest positions demonetization and lockdown being most criticized i do not believe that needed back off for political games up strong under yogi there something else happening in punjab and we really should wait until dust settles there no need try and analyze with such knee jerk reactions aim i believe anti modi but do have any alternative
democracy win farmers win
i will support farm bills if anyone can explain how govt going handle all of below listed points copied from fb post i still will not support way govt treated protesting farmers over 160 died in 2 months while on protest
did not tell anything about new farm bill and started comparing
corrupt govt need stop this scam of buying votes on name of sending farmers 2000rupee every 3 month instead make msp as law so farmers get their cost make mw minimum wage law so general labour working in cities and metro cities in construction renovations cleaning gardners and servants and maids for rich and ultra rich above middle class
his views were totally govt centric supplied that hey big farmers small farmers if we have that much wheat in surplus distribute that poor people accross india
i pray god protect our farmers stay strong we will win
maybe in few years time or even months we might well see no 1 crony capitalist of present government becoming richest person in world on one hand and on other hand indian farmers having difficulty in even making ends meet
loss farmers and farming sector because of bad politics of modi who failed present benifits of farm laws but great win for democracy indeed
some parts of laws problematic does not allow farmer go court if they feel they wronged by dealers highest official for that sdm that creating fear in farmers why govt had add this extra bit in laws if tomorrow wronged by someone and not allowed go court by some new law would not oppose would like know sg view on this
we support farmers
i think farmers should responsible because they should not go red fort

we r with farmersugly face modi govt
full support strong support from indian muslims our sikh brothers and farmers from all over india
this time im not with farmers at all
very right that benefit of msp going only rich farmers while poor farmers unable improve their conditions new farm reform laws address this concern by allowing private sector in agriculture field concern that private sector would exploit farmers acquire their land conservative one clearly mentioned in new laws that private players cannot farmers land laws made protect farmers interests while at same time modernise agriculture sector with help of private sector
i feel that this reformed agriculture bill proposed by gov needs some changes amendments ensure that our most diligent hardworking farmer brothers get their truly deserving rewards
very bad know about our indian farmers condition now they have come out from their houses and protest under sky get proper facilities from government for all of cultivate food we have taught in colleges our development based on green revolution after that we entered in industrial revolution farmers not only back bone of developed countries they have well known as our food kitchens where we get day night meals farmers standing among just like at home relationship of parents and children problem our corrupt politicians imaging all time five stars hotel life just use and through food plates how will teach them do justice respect and love how many hands involve bring food in your eating plate where ever justice not in action then wait for big punch from our creator in shape of many disaster nation almighty allah fulfill needs of our farmers them safe happy and successful ameen

we being as one nation completely supports our farmers but let not make political issue
if indian media and indian anchors and their analysts had been so smart and brave they would not have given ladakh finger area so carelessly and stubbornly incompetently china instead of worrying about afghanistan and start worrying about seven states because despite having 200 000 indian troops india would not have send its special commandos out of kashmir arunachal pradesh and siliguri corridors just and your indian media anchors and so called analysts shame on for how long people will continue make fools of your people and nation by blocking them
inviting private companies buy farmer produce directly
i thought fourth generation war strategy was highly adaptable in india because both parties in india ruling and opposition use this tactic well but i am surprised that we losing this strategy of war against other countries i do not understand that reason
hi shekhar i agree with most of things u have mentioned in video and thanks for sharing such valuable information but i do not think that intention of modi government by bringing this bill persuade farmers produce more diverse crops like moongfali musturd and all other crops india importing from other countries that india really need that u have mentioned i have not heard even single statement from government about all these problems that u discussed i want agree with that government really have good agenda behind this bill but i do not see any statements from government
please remember 600 farmers has lost their life please that in mind vote wisely

up elections and congress sp game plan
not single media of country talks about our country talks only about problem of pakistan because modi afraid that channel should be shut down
focused more on fictional benefits of bill which not actually applicable we insecure farmers already united but their unity can do nothing what if no one come forth buy our produce and corporates get united demand buy on low price what can we do we have sell on what prices they want because we have no msp and right go court and also there was no restriction for farmers sell out of apmc mandis before this bill so please first know ground reality then make video experts dont know as much as we farmers know about our profession
i also farmer but never support these khalistani
really vital that 1 million of who have watched this video educate ones around who have been blindsided by indian media
msp used by rich farmers artiyas transport harvested crops from other states like rajasthan up by farmers artiyas and then selling inpunjab govt agencies in mandis at msp as locally harvested produce
fact 2 samdish checked his mic more times than modi checked bills before signing them off
panjab and haryana only protesting farmers because other state farmers do not even know bills when they come and passed
people who r celebrating right now about repeal of laws will demand reforms and blame govt for deteriorating situation of farmers after 5 years
kutha modi and bjp louda
goverment right grow country gdp but its rupe for farmer but farmer dont need r i p english
i support my farmers
i support farmers of india
do bot repeal farm laws let farmers go hell
good explanation except 3rd bill removing commodities will not directly increase farmers income all farmers not in position of negotiating with pvt players probably initially for first few years may increase farmers income but eventually theyll be left at mercy of pvt players who in their greed make more profits will try their best procure at cheapest possible rates
regarding third one amendment of essential commodities act 1955 will not have negative side effect of allowing companies buy large quantity of something and hoard and then once they have very large quantity stored up they can essentially control price and sell
what they thinking about those farmers as some sort of crash dummy
uneducated farmers manhandled by some politicians they want middle man in their business transactions so let them live with their middle man mechanism
farmers have done their job now our turn crush these modi media
thanks for explains in details qq why oil seeds price still less in india

farmers have actually made easy for dominant middle men who have monopoly and mint money had they understood law they would have realized was not against them
magic of election before election fuel taxes reduced farm laws repealed
this type leaders those type of leader which only criticise government on there decision which good or bad gya bolenge haa kha h bura gya kha bura h and government overall not bad some of there policies bad whether its congress and bjp
modi media just shut up and learn how speak truth

lndian holds unimaginable undisputed unbreakable world record for longest time being colinized and also by most countries with british alone responsible for looting 45 trillion 1 8 billion indians died from deprivation in 1757 1947
i think good law for farmers but government should also ensure that apmc markets will be continue in such way as they running now
i never supported farm laws but i fully support caa
thank trevor noah so much for talking about of this demand this historical protest in india and with peaceful means and objectives similar or bigger than mahatma gandhi movements govt has tried all tricks of political world dividing on religious lines calling them anti national etc suppress this but has failed miserably 200 elders have died in biting cold on borders they chose live in pathetic conditions for months now make their word heard there lack of trust on government intentions on these laws govt behaving like autocratic government and focus always on elections votes and since next elections in 2024 they choose play this game long they in power with all machinery police force tax payers money with them fight out what do farmers have will power protest

3 04 dearest geeta only see other side of coin that farmers violent what about police brutality which made people run for their life two people had died as far as i know and one shot dead by police
modi govt should compensate loss of lives of our 700 farmers rip
talking about politics and how should be played and how tactics of nm as should have been instead of what economic empowerment these reforms going bring seems like misdirecting people away from what they fighting for do we have numbers or estimates of how much economical improvement this farm laws can bring among farmers and indian economy could kindly share them so that people can look at them and decide themselves instead of watching your fiction drama
non farmers will definitely not gonna understand this agriculture bills new bills already failed in many countries including in many indian states where this bills were applied earlier one interesting thing these bills not applied in gujarat what hypocrisy pm modi

simply saying that if they fake farmers khalistani break threshold do not wait and just charge i do not find this wrong
they will rename bills do some changes and make sure gets accepted by actual farmers
now protesting farmers can go sight seeing in delhi for 1 more month till actual repeal happens in parliament
none of these opposition parties understand democracy they talk about democracy but support lawlessness where fundamental principles like justice and dignity all citizens have rights and obligations dont these so called farmers have any duties in democracy other road users dont have right free access roads if motorists feel threatened by crowd of so called farmers such accidents can happen therefore rules must be clear and apply equally everyone this aimless protest should never have lasted so long sc should have previously imposed ban on so called farmers and fine for each day of non compliance such accidents were be expected government and judiciary have learned nothing from caa protest and delhi riots staying aimlessly camping on road cant be right in itself
thanks for video vox very well explained and informative i hope indian media will learn something from this
i felt that repealing of bill will go smoothly but by looking at these opposition roughness i came know that this real politics going on
i like how tikait trolls godi anchors
farmers given choice sell directly outside mandis might harm their interests as they not educated how protect their interests 4 might lead exploitation by rich businesses and debt trap as businesses will be their baap 5 commodificaton of agriculture might lead food insecurity 6 previous steps aplm act more than 15 states adopted provisions give farmers choice of sale outside mandis but not many farmers reaped benefits swaminathan committee msp should be c2 50 but not implemented correctly santha kumar committee only 6 farmer hh get benefit of msp more than 65 paddy and wheat growers do not know about govt procuring grains 2019 maha 3927 suicides highest in country despite loan waivers and reforms india 10281 suicides 28 suicides day so practical implementation key
farmers have won early deserting of their lands emotions over intellect
now india trying make relations with taliban
indian medias may show this as protest from kabul against taliban
i was with farmer protest but due this violence true essence has protest has lost and one cannot at no sense justify this cataclysmic event
every political leaders claiming that win of farmers and expecting that their party shall be maximum beneficiary of this agitation now let see results in forthcoming elections best of luck everyone
modi yogi should resign immediately

if india did farming in western manner with say 100 hectare farms that would support application of fertilizers drip irrigation mechanical harvesting and processing storage and transportation issues resolved quantity of produce reaching markets could well double but number of laborers required would likely reduce from 700 12 million at which point 1 of population still engaged in agriculture would likely account for 30 of gdp this leaves question of what do with surplus 688 million bodies
best explanation about farm bill in youtube well done ma am and your team
power people victory indians
5 farmers cannot filed case against corporates if they forcibly capture their fields only they can go teethless sdm court
responsible for loss of life of innocent farmers
sir i am cds aspirant but my father farmer in up this video help me in ssb
modi lost battle after calling farmers terrorists and after more than thousand farmers died during protest rahul gandhi and opposition won battle against farmers law
unexpected from modi govt being farmers daughter i saddened by this move only one state farmers will decide agriculture of india total failure of govt they were arrogant did not bother talk opposition get them on same page
such incident will tarnished india image global forum but i nvr expect our farmer brothers law in hand
even if laws repealed wouldnt that also create resentment against punjab for derailment of reforms best path would have been find amicable mid way solution but farmers dont want that
farmers categorisation by goi marginal upto 2 5 acre or 1 ha small 2 5 acre 5 acre semi medium 5 10 acre medium 10 25 acre and large above 25 acre needs be revoked 28 lakh farmers of rajasthan who owns more than 5 acre land not getting benefit of loan waiver or benefit of other govt scheme like ebc reservation etc kisan leader not aware about these issues
farmers will have ensure this government does not start covert plan b against them
so farmer bill good

anonymous official we in state where slavery has been accepted wholesale and there people who believe that ruling class has legitimate moral right rule and other people legitimately their slaves this really where we at in humanity worldwide and vast majority of people have accepted that paradigm and what cult religious belief system that completely false completely erroneous there not enough people speaking out encourage that that false paradigm and belief system this what message that we have put out there this body of population that still believes mainstream media narrative and still believes government narrative believe in authority condone slavery that exactly what stop sugarcoating and start saying what other people believe in authority condone slavery if believer in authority and believer that there moral legitimacy government someone who saying i believe in and condone slavery because that what right command and rule other people slavery and that what government on its face and i will not sugarcoat that that what i here put that out there as plain and simple truth and encourage others do same there no such thing as right rule or command others we have stop believing that there because even believe condone slavery and completely immoral and completely based on violence so now what happening that narrative of this master class being said never be questioned not be questioned by members of slave class this what all this social shaming all about by members of cult see cult members want point fingers at other people who do not believe their worldview of authority their authoritative authoritarian worldview know they want say shame on no not shame on shame on for accepting that slavery morally legitimate how about that that how tables have be turned your worldview false and illegitimate morally on its face and now big tech companies big tech corporations trying make impossible get word out by censoring social media and censoring people and deplatforming them and all that gonna do insight very very dark days ahead let just say already turning in that direction because of how people have been oppressed and people do not understand what powder keg not just powder keg here in america folks powder keg worldwide and better psychologically prepare yourself and i telling everybody out there too because most people who say they for truth and for freedom did not do their work they failed at their job morally educate public there not enough of voice of truth reality spoken into existence ladies and gentlemen universe has spoken into existence what we experience in our daily reality in aggregate in collective based upon what people said what people accepted into them information they took in and that what informed their behavior and now what ruling class wants do try make impossible get that word out there and they going ensure violent outcome as result of that that what i have been trying prevent from day one and that what i have been trying tell my viewership and listenership that your personal responsibility through your actions help prevent by teaching people true morality and unfortunately we failing in that job collectively we failing in that job and going see result of that failure in physical world these people believe that all alternative viewpoints of reality perspectives of reality be banned and banished and even possibly made illegal okay people who do not accept their worldview as put out there by mainstream media and government and other officials or experts not be challenged and they have their rights stripped from them if they do not accept that worldview well i do not accept your worldview i believe my knowledge far superior yours and i not afraid tell that real reality of this no one has right force worldview upon others we have right speak what truth i cannot ultimately force on anybody i could just show ignorant person how they have been deceived but just like i cannot force my worldview on other people no one can force their worldview on me or others because here truth of matter folks government media and even scientists not arbiters of truth truth exists independently of any human being perception of our goal bring our perception into alignment with that which namely truth and we have do that through rigid truth discovery psychology and taking in high volumes of eclectic information from all over many different sources even those we do not agree with putting them all together logically weeding out all inconsistencies so that we distill down base essence of that which true and only then can we say we have accurate understanding of what taking place and most people do not do that process ladies and gentlemen i do do that process and i not going have people that do not do tell me what i must believe because expert said i will perform truth discovery methodology process on information myself and come my own conclusion about and so should everyone else so no one gonna tell me other people arbiters of truth no one arbiter of truth not even me not not anyone as individual their conclusions do not mean that truth and their conclusions cannot be violently pushed upon others that what unfortunately taking place in our world people with no knowledge just completely giving into fear and biggest fear fear of unknown because fear of unknown what holds people back from knowledge and higher awareness see if fear knowledge because fear what might discover going create feedback loop of fear because fear comes from lack of knowledge those who informed not in fear ignorance what creates fear refusal of truth what creates fear i have no such fear because i have accepted what truth and i have aligned my perception but here where we at folks societally this what self mastery all about understanding laws of universe understanding natural law and then actually applying that true spirituality in one life through our behaviors through our actions in right way through right action next way out self respect true respect true looking again at qualities of ourself as individual self respect true healer want cure real human sickness then apply true healer which self respect first and foremost this development of internal courage look at truth and then speak truth publicly not just your family and friends where think safe needs be out there publicly in courageous way where telling people i not afraid know turn off lying fearmongering state controlled media affront self respect stop believing that others have right command there no such right there no such moral right this way out true courage courage universe protection universal protection we talk about know protective equipment know shield from illness this real universal

if private players saying they will pay higher rates and can come apmc and be first buyers of farm produce whats issue in guaranteeing msp also fci can procure and sell grains private players along with distributing them in pds in order reduce deficit farmers getting compensated correctly for their produce will definitely circulate money back in economy private players can offer establish storages government should try and work with private players rather than leaving farmers on mercy of market demands

5 most importantly about poor farmers of entire india vs mislead rich farmers of punjab poor farmers who cannot afford pizza would be happy for new option sell their crops in private market because they not being able sell at apmc anyway rich farmers of punjab just confused whether they will themselves lead closure of apmc if they do not want this entirely upto them
may guru nanak himself bless mr pm and may bjp win in byelections of 2022 punjab
godi media why ur highlighting khalistan in ur words there shud be rules for anchors also
watching this with my family love your channel from uk thanks for covering no farmers no food
amazing made understand whole thing why farmers on strike
farmers have right sell their crops wherever they want that freedom also n advise vox do not u compare farming policy with america n europe policy
farm laws which were enacted were 100 correct and bjp knew that people livin in punjab those r farmers who r roaming in porsche n can afford pay apmc mandi bill but their not one section in whole india uk other regions where people r not that wealthy r unable pay bill they can sell private companies without paying any tax n when comes thing that if produce not that gud somehow then they can sell apmc as usual with msp n thing that farmers were saying that they were not consulted beforehand what do u guys think modi ji had dream last night n decided implement law next day this law has beeen in process of discussion since decades
died farmers should get compensation
in conclusion repeal does not work well for ind and agriculture no doubt about that however declaration of forming committee bring in agri reforms was also made in same speech keeping in mind khalistani factor in punjab i guess good move for now and bjp stands good chance make beneficial for as well i know immediate reaction for supporters like bjp chose politics or namo weak but i guess bjp better placed handle those things than was handle punjab scenario in democracy both government and opposition needs act responsibly for country make progress sabotaging opposition does not help one cannot clap with one hand
in short farmers have option sell their products wherever they get best price could be company or direct consumer or any other market
i understand farm law through sekhar ji and i know was good for people same caa but its ok atleast we know why our farmers and muslim in poor state because they do not want change also i learnt if have free people can do anything in this country can legalize porn reduce sentencing for criminals all need people who do not understand anything with recently pm modi visited my home town jhansi and we were so much happy i saw first prime minister bother about bundelkhand no one else i remember ever visisted and stay there

congress same bill laye agar bjp laa kharab logic where go
just like arab spring india revolution throw away govt also important note that defence forces all other security services in favour of these farmers most of whom their families parents rebel mutiny very clearly on way may just few days or weeks hence
problem msp which government cannot give legal assurance making msp legal can make indian farm products unsellable in global market due their high price
please spares their farm land there big mistake about farmers while drafting laws because in india land pride of farmer means both bulls lock their horn
one thing more bill doesnt states that private buyers will garanteed buy stuff from all farmers where in mandis i seen all stuff wheat or rice sold
laws written as agrarian reform but really its agrarian regulation with stripping of protections rather than adding more protections that needed this regulation in spirit of trying kill small agrarian society and transfer big business mentality which farmers obviously not in agreement with
always with our farmers they fighting for everyone protesting against this fascist government we will win this fight
why modi brings farmers laws
they told in punjab that these bills anti farmer
lot of alphanso mango producer in konkan maharashtra allready selling their products world same thing can happen for other small farmers all over india due new laws
every thing very shameful form gov so called farmers and silent people

3 farm laws only beneficial poor farmers landless labourers and marginal farmers and not at all beneficial rich farmers and loss dalals who runs mandis that why these rich farmers and dalals by their money power made even poor farmers as their supporters
mr ravish kumar political potentials responsible make or break national success china jumped in afghanistan achieve every possible earnings through investments and so on in spite indian leaders need ages understand how join hands more indians need no positive development but only jai sri ram better instrument stay in illusion with in country

modi great strategist there must have been good reason for him withdraw we need trust modi losing up could be devastating for bjp india needs modi bjp
edit i said bcz all farmers have sons who in indian army police or high post like ias and they will not quiet if their fathers will be exploited and indira gandhi was shot by comando so u can see
this scene of togetherness and support for farmers from non farmers community adding fuel rss and their ideology wait and watch rss will surely use state machinery cause trouble for these protesters very dark days ahead
one section of farmers won others again will face same poverty one problem of democracy system
q2 how will contract farming shield farmers from potential losses due weather like msp we know settlement have been abysmally low
not all people who support farm laws believe that farmers moment khalisthani movement there lot of them who have welfare of farmers at their heart and believe that farm laws were right step in that direction if categorize all those that hold view point other than that of yours as some sort of narrow minded fools then how better than those new channels that criticizing
i think bjp waana set grounds in punjab with alliance with captain ameinder singh new party or him joining bjp

surplus of food bad because low prices invalidate small farms but deficit of food much worse
repealing farm laws against development but without change how will govt double income of farmers upto 2022
what about india investment in afghanistan against pakistan
we should not forget role of haryana and some district of up too even after complete crackdown by bjp led state government they support punjab in protest this real protest not like caa where become roits before become protest hope we up can support but even akhilesh and all other opposition leader restricted from going out protest
i feel this incomplete piece of story should have explained what farmers law what does state and how affects farmers instead this documentary just states what farmers think about law
see farmers were not happy with these laws govt repealed them farmers shud be happy now outcome will be fair unfair all will know soon
big loss farmers but also end of all hope for opposition win
when accustomed privilege equality feels like oppression farmers truly fit this phrase
this people who explaining what will happen in contract farming those who even i guess not even put their footprint in any farm reading book nd making video easy but have ever analyzed how many companies in india have done contract with farmers and even did not come buy their harvest if corporate will decide harvest price then time will come when like way now we not allowed use incoming calls free or even for dd news or doordarshan for free even that has minimum trai fees same farmers will be bound sell nearby available corporates only even at whatever price they decide and even if any conflict occurs we do not have so many magistrates that they can handle those matters we will thousands of legal formalities that farmers will not understand even they will not go and stand for their return that was promised under pressure of all these legal formalities and conduct sitting in corporate and buying these harvest and doing business out of would be routine for corporates but those who will face consequences out of will be in pain anyways guys carry on supporting bill
now bjp will win and shut dukkan of congress in punjab too
now few people say that farmers not so educated understand online procedures

minimum supporting price not for all crops grown by farmers as said price discovery happening in apmc not good if there price agreement before sowing itself atleast there will be assured buyer presently farmers growing thinking that there will be buyer from somewhere for their produce and unfortunately many times they throwing their produce on roads and committing suicides i have studied in agricultural university and we were taught about advantages of contract farming when buyer also will have assured price for his supplies and can also proceed further with his processing i do not know why this painted with communist or socialist angle when shirt or pizza can have price before selling why not farmers produce pl make deeper study and analyse
i from pakistan and surprised india still have such people very non bised analysis
for political rallies and elections there no carona no rules when farmers started agitating for their rights suddenly govt woke up and preaching about covid rules and trying put restrictions shame on them
all political parties with farmers and winners
well done modiji we with

bbc was against kisaan kanoon earlier but now reverse hypocracy of bbc
i do not think bjp bothered with punjab i guess they have gift wrapped and given captain and for now would be taking care of that state for remaining states bjp can simply put entire blame on opposition for repeal of farm laws given that there was very little protest across country i guess most farmers believed that laws were good for them i will not be surprised if bjp now raises pitch against opposition and shifts entire responsibility on them after all bjp did try tried for almost two years but punjab was slipping away from ind and something had be done
i support farmer but what did was not right who ask him bring sword protest talwar lata piecefull protest
those supported taliban rule they need shift taliban permanently from india immediately gaddar
modi led bjp government took this step after vote

masterpiece created by lallantop team kisanektazindabad
unfortunate people of india not ready for reforms now if rates of agricultural commodities fluctuates drastically or farmers cheated by agents or traders government of india not be blamed
i believe this political masterstroke on bjp behalf there elections in punjab and up in 2022 so teer do nishaane for bjp
why people treat farmers like they something above everything they do farming earn not feed for free they doing business same as everyone doing
i salute farmers
do not support big corrupt companies support our farmers
problem in india many people on farming so land very less and so investment power also less
heinous act by government provoke farmers show violence while they have been protesting peacefully for almost more than 50 days they do their best provide food each and everyone but their own country leaders do not listen their voice
there no such things as removal of mandis or msp its simply being marketed by congress
they reallly farmers all orchestrated
hopefully now joh desh saalo sey farmers suicide ker thai luxury life jhi sakhenge thank god

if farmers dont want this law why force on them
no farmers no food
so great farmers
had been following reporting way sequence had been going on would not have believed was in farmers nature do that do not show propaganda news
i still remember 26 january these so called farmer unions should be held accountable for loss they causing indian economy by blocking roads
accepting arguments that laws should have been passed with much more finess and communicated better do sincerely believe these real reasons why these failed why leaving out facts that only small portion of farmers were against there were 13 rounds of talks which failed mainly since demand was only repeal of laws most of provisions of these laws being debated for last many years including previous regime and will throw some light on how many of 91 reforms were discussed with stakeholders some impartial journalism this
please do not serve incomplete knowledge i studied bill nothing wrong in essential commodities act too
india has largest agricultural land in world even larger than and china india farmland one of most fertile inspite india agriculture productivity quality profitability so low and has been declining for decades which pushed experts including economists agri scientists policymakers entrepreneurs look for overhaul solutions reforms solution put forward by these experts advocated by imf and world bank these suggested reforms have been out there for decades but since costs lot of political capital none of weak indian govt in 90 and 2000s dared do very similar case 1991 lpg reforms read about which transformed indian economy finally this govt decided chew bullets also they have enough political capital spend bring in reforms and as expected protests broke in
worstest time in our country after independence our country farmers been beaten lots of shame on modi ji
dear sir agreed that punjab and haryana farmers doing well and they want current status quo continue but there other farmers in rest of india who want scale up and do something for example kerala farmers all ready scale up on jack fruit powder and making arrangements for cold storage system which will be made available through fpo farmer producer organizations like this there many many examples if punjab and haryana happy with status quo then so be
apmc act has many flaws as mentioned 10 54 farmers from punjab and haryana one who most benefited by msp but only around 6 percent of farmers can benefit of msp all over india
msp should be for bolr buyers of last resort will usually be percentage lower than market price but what farmers asking for bofr buyers of first resort does not make sense
all old tractors getting fitted fir local licrnce less leaders and farmers which will be pulled by buffaloes and bulls show high fuel price also reason for creating public nuisance can be any silly thing
2 farmers do not have negotiating power farmers can force governemnt of india repeal act which for their own benefit but same farmer unions do not have negotiating power with private companies
yes ajay mishra should resign immediately his intention clear teach lesson farmers
ajit anjumji your contribution in victory of farmers also important
why would farmers protest against their own freedom

ideally media should focus on whether bills anti farmers and how not type of report that can be used as propaganda by inciting sympathies ask these protesters what bills exactly stand for and not even 1 of them will exactly know what they stand on protestors also giving feedback leaders as how they should act when govt negotiating with them so willfully i think communist leaders working in their own self interest and propaganda in govt negotiations
inspite of this video republic bharat arnab cawsamy supporting bjp india today atleat fair in this matter
win for farmers win for democracy
i do not care what bill said not that any of what said made any good sense india democracy will of majority rules glad see we can still government on and they will listen
building administration which will help farmers by providing them with buildings freeze grain etc also sir another reason why i think farmers not trusting bill because developed countries like united systems and european countries have privatized agriculture and hasnt worked
happy about farmers but like they say in video its about election not coincidence that lowering petrol also happened at same time
more than 50percent of government support goes these farmers
but as there was no problem in farm law non of farmer was able tell single problem in farm law
what basic problem with farmers

highly appreciate ndtv and whole team including camera persons lightings etc for wonderful ground coverage in indian farmer protests
1 mishandling of agitation by govt and bjp on assumption that would fizzle out in due course powers that be could not fathom strength of resolve of farmers

why vice does not show monster truck mode of tractors literally trying run over police

imf farm laws beneficial for economy of india
this in fact fundamental difference between new laws and existing laws of most of states that already permit private markets operate some states also allow contract farming and virtually no state bans its farmers from selling anywhere in india but false narrative has been created that new reforms create one nation one market as if did not exist before punjab farmers have been selling crops like kinnow potato cotton etc all over india just as bihar sends truck loads of paddy punjab and haryana because its apmcs were abolished in 2006 and private markets not remunerative
ruined lives of youth farmers and poor indians
every punjabi knows what written in 3 page bill we have very intelligent person in indian parliament called bhagwant mann who explains every clause of bill in detail
why print making look like this competition for govt too govt from beginning has given enough respect farmers whatever reason may be vote etc even now i think they quiet and this might just work they just might outlast these protests i think they can scatter protests even faster if they explain laws in better way people on ground yes i think that farmers group now taking this as fight for their respect again i am just student but this just shows why we india might not be able grow as fast china has done in last decades people personal hidden agendas will always be more important than india growth will always be more important than taking people above poverty will always be more important than establishing healthcare system simple people will always get behind short sighted people running for their personal gains and we india will wasting time
thanks bbc for covering farmer protest when maximum of india media sold out in hand of govt
support farmers for your own food in future
why no western president blames indian government regarding indian farmer protest
as far as farm laws concerned its not over till bjp over they have gold standards in licking boots of money makers
bihar always had least per capita income in fact ever since mandis have been eliminated agri growth there has skyrocketed mandis inefficient and needs be undone editor also conveniently omitted fact that average land holding in bihar less than third than in punjab relatively speaking farmers in bihar have higher per capita income
please support farmers corporates will exploit poor farmers especially small scale farmers
if these laws were so righteous as saying then why didnt meet farmers even once nautanki cover up past deeds and off course elections coming
model talking about in implementation in wasi in maharashtra and bihar this pro corporate representative ignoramus person because not aware model advocating already in existence in bihar and wasi in maharashtra and farmers in worst condition persons like him impediments in road welfare state

govt needs initiate formation of platform for farmers in order manage agriecosystem with pricing policy as prevails in industrial sector in fact pricing policy for home market needs be uniform for all products this will safe guard equal opportunity for all citizens each one time will fetch equal monetary remuneration but i do not mean work of higher importance will not be rewarded has got be rewarded with out being monetary directly may be facilities that provide ease of life like services for which financial expenditure may be incurred by nation well coming back agri policy following points may please be considered for debate
not happy with taliban success but on lighter note this means pakistan defeat super power and nato
rakesh tikayath living for jawan and kissans am from kerala and ex army person jaat we have enjoyed in army being south indian jaat true
currently modiji seems have lost his pathway and has been quarreling with allies of shree atul bihari vajpayee founder of bjp and 1st bjp prime minister of india and has turned their close allies into their adversaries and foes
farmers should not think that care for them
modi great man jisne garib kisano baare me sochha and farm law repeal warna ko chodne top leader
did know farmers in india do not pay income tax despite fact that there tax slabs care of poorer farmers why that none of these people cried injustice when investors in india have pay income tax dividend distribution tax and later individual income tax with additional cess for sake of subsidizing their produce that no one going buy and probably gonna end up with rats and insects in some govt warehouse these people should feel shameful that first they left nation that they now call home for better lifestyle in developed nation but when india implements reforms go in same direction they have guilt government into regressing back licence raj regime
i am happy for indian people by reading comments becoming smart not just puppets hats off people can change everything public of pakistan and india can overthrow these hypocrite governments

vox has good format for making videos and explanation unfortunately your plain and simple explanation sometimes leaves out lot of important facts i would encourage everyone read actual bills that were passed in both house and not just rely on media explanation and perceptions before forming opinion this not comment pro or against farmers but general observation in this age of rampant digital misinformation one should be very careful and always consume any news piece with pinch of salt
farmers right
mei andhbhakt but now i am not bjp supporter
we tamil people support farmers
modi succeeded in bringing bill we failed deserve
i understand these 3 bills good for farmers but mostly illeteracy driving them towards dependency on middleman agents but central government must boost counciling farmers and educate them
this peasant movement will go down in history as new trendsetter and will serve as harbinger of new era indian farmers have now shown what they capable of now let workers and farmers of this and other countries must carry forward struggle

half of country works in agriculture i feel for these farmers who have likely been on single family small farms for generations but reality that shouldnt be sustained in 21st century when more efficient options for country as whole available if look at farmers decreasing share of wealth by gdp its mostly not because they getting poorer its because all other sectors getting richer as they continue industrialize innovate in short term may be hard believe but in long term what government doing probably for best of all of them
khalistani killed four bjp workers

bjp has lost its base in haryana as well but they will still win in other places by doing hindu muslim

well taliban defeated usa they should just walked over pakistan
incorrect assumption that private players will pay more than mandi price only way solve this problem increase farm yields per acre thereby reducing cost of production so that cost of production per kg quintal lower than free market rate our agriculture universities have completely failed farmers and our country help improve farm productivity levels without solving for this farming in our country loss making and not sustainable and farmers will continue need financial support
india with farmars
your findings right but has some loopholes i come from farmers family we grow two crops every year and in my locality everyone does same if not 2 grain crops then one legume and one grain so practically no remains same will not increase by 1 5 or 150 percent also yield of rice more at some places hectare then wheat cant rally relate anyways other findings great
after up election again farm laws will be introduced
congrats our dear farmers
everything has been exposed now and hope real farmers undertand bcs they themselves supported bills earlier thanks greta thunburg gretathunburgexposed
but not good for farmers who want change with time
punjab will face ground water shortage due excessive rice farming
in era of vague and false media reporting ravish kumar done his job left me speechless
they specifically used public buses stop so later on they can accuse farmers for damaging public property
2 do other state farmers have issue of middleman
apki video kr clear gya h vipaksh sirf jhooth bolkar roti sek modi ji actually trying bring change in system aur nakli neta kisano ko pagal bna h i support bill completely as will benefit farmers jai hind
u r straight forward yes but u have also mentioned why farmer do not believe on modi government as they see their past records of gst all that
everyone has their own interpretation and hypothesis clear that farmers in punjab will loose thats why they protesting farmers in other parts of india indifferent thats why they not protesting
why cannot govt invest in food storage facilities and charge farmers for storage
what can pm modi do if farmers do not want benefit government was giving kind of foolishness farmers have done astounding literally throwing brick on own foot in long term protesting farmers will realise their big blunder
4 wasted on farmers
means indirectly government want large farmers become trader too
why government in second term and with parliamentary majority do this same here in uk bjp shouldnt be going congress route
how have govt side can explain why farmers of usa where open market and farmers their under debt
if in case in future days apmc completely eliminate in society and after price fixing system will be handle by only private bodis and they bids very cheep price after former where go for selling
just proved that do not possess 56 inch chest should not repeal that law sad day for future of indian economy
should have been mentioned that food companies retailers can buy non perishable items in large quantities at time of harvesting giving no sensible price benefits farmers and store that sell within mandated 100 increase without attracting essential commodities act even if that provision imposed prospectively will not make any dent on company profit so will squarely benefit procurers only anyone who track of increase in onion prices every year knows that this play by large traders only farmers do not get any benefit of higher prices hereafter will be legitimate action for all commodities
why does not government shortlist agricultural items which can be exported say like onions then gradually wean farmer towards more productive land use
in future every kisan should carry flag attached strong danda if police attack peaceful protests then do not hesitate defend your life right by law for every human being protect their life even if against police next protest carrying danda must
great setback agricultural reforms in india farmers with small holdings would be sufferers and overall agricultural production potential would go down no government in future would ever dare bring such much needed reforms in agriculture politics won but nation lost
every citizen in free country has democratic right as do farmers
punjab was chosen as battleground against hunger enterprising sikh farmers worked hard create what we know as green revolution
no farmers no food no future
support farmers
shekhar gupta appreciate your excellent analysis and sharing some key elements of 3 farmer laws for common man thank very much
looks like pro khalistanis and pakistani agenda similar very well pre planned well executed in delhi riots people smart enough put two and two together modus operandi so glaring
we stand with farmers
these 3 laws wrong here and now because of way they were introduced and because of room they create for corruption however they signal inevitable evolution they will fail today because of how profoundly they represent nature and will of current administration however they will resurface in future with new look and different energy simply because only way forward enable economic freedom and create competitiveness on global scale india farmers must collectively organize and empower themselves control of their own destinies and grasp levers of free market utilization create wealth and economic independence today they still manipulated by opportunists and illegal collaborators who advantage of existing policies enrich themselves at expense of simple minded and marginal landowners efficiency must be realized by utilizing agricultural indias limited natural resources continue feed exploding population intermediate way forward give farmers tools and wisdom start down road first realize and appreciate their latent collective power create free market in their own image and second create robust environment in which recognize appreciate and honestly process complexities created by indian way of thinking and operating this way
there some farmers protecting police officers but no police officer protecting any farmer
cut off food police guarantee pice protection dispute tribunal and agreement protection farmers ask our farmer minister cannot even attend one meeting what non sense this

well mr shekhar conveniently missed out legal implications farmers incase these corporates takes loans against farm lands and what happens if corporates do not pay amount as promised or reduce rates
while implementing upi most of people against and most of people blamed will be failure so we cannot judge anything just leave about punjab farmers
but thing here if anything goes fraud with this contract farmers can not assistance of court
government play with farmer anndata
they not farmers they r khalistani
enquiry by cbi must be initiated against farmers lost life and culprits must be punished for killing those poor farmers and right people must be compensated by govt forfeit fund required from irresponsibl leaders like tikait
i think central govt should announce that committee headed by mr satya pal malik will look after issues related agri msp implementation and all farmer related issues and will submit its report within 6 months skm leader will immediately call agitation
perfectly said silence not weapon for injustice and farmers protest proved this point hats off farmers unity and strong message everyone who has democracy for ride

greatness of modi govtto go against parliamentary democracy now make any propaganda by librando narrative but i dont support modi repealing this bill
very good approach god bless our farmers
had explained things well but finally end up in erroneous conclusion definitely there lots of issues with current apmc systems bt new acts going worsen situation further now onwards farmers needs bargain with more powerful purchasers than earlier small traders small medium farmers would not have any bargaining power with big corporates if intention was make msp mandatory in every private transaction why did bills not contain clause that price paid farmer by purchaser shall not be less than notified msp that why lakhs of farmers on streets
all indians here loving taliban
low milk prices so lets waist fule put wear and tare on farm equipment and waist hay or straw i get protesting but i see big waist of money wish i had that money waist
modiji please dont do 2nd blunder of restoring statehood of j please look beyond your party
4 yes true that punjab and haryana most benefited by msp system and most of farmers who benefitted by msp big farmers but state like uttar pradesh where percentage of small and marginal farmers high they can not awail this msp system due weak structure of apmcs

i have been so clueless about why farmer protests happening and i am indian no matter where i looked was 99 noise and 1 advertisement vox explained this better than indian govt probably could that was so well made kudos
not farmer nor fair efforts farmer they really interested in supporting political leader and party workers
there no case for resigning here this new india no sissies in power now not like old days that something happens and minister resigns his son innocent even if his son proved be murderer why should his father pay for his son sins as srk leave industry and give up his billion dollar wealth because his son nasheedi
laws wouldve benefited large farmers undoubtedly however ones lose wouldve been lay 2 3 bigha owner why would pepsico go buy potatoes from 2 bigha owner care write agreements with him rather than going someone who owns 50 hectares its funny see how this all elusive most of urban elite yapping here small farmer will lose through commercialisation of agriculture his holdings will become unviable once private sector steps in and will be forced enter contracts with them effectively reducing him sharecropper tenant with no urban jobs attract surplus labour from villages rather villages became sponges when covid caused massive urban rural migration where will surplus labour go other than becoming labourers in their own fields effectively reviving zamindari and company raj
current gdp around rs 140 lakh crores agricultural gdp rs 19 lakh crores value of food grains rs 11 lakh crores farmers offer around 50 of food grains for sale at rs 5 5 lakh crores of which 50 sold in apmcs at 2 75 lakh crores considering cost of procurement at 30 value of 23 msp crops approximately rs 3 6 lakh crores total tax and non tax revenue for government rs 23 lakh crores gst 3 income tax 8 corporate tax 7 non tax revenue 5 lakh crores msp commitment of rs 3 6 lakh crores exceed entire gst collected around 70 of tax revenues generated from urban areas unless tax revenues increase substantially legalizing msp toughest therefore in addition institutional solution of msp market solution permitting buying selling outside apmcs benefits society due new supply value chains further nominal protection coefficient for agriculture being 0 87 farmers can realize 13 higher price in international markets with encouragement exports
this drama calibrated by both farmers and bjp from both sides dirty politics involved
both sides have communication gap because farmers not ready tell loopholes of 3 laws and government not trying explain laws correctly people
brother just know what going on in depth without this superficial knowledge and judge goverment decision and farmers decision just do not know how much residents and merchants inside delhi suffered even while showing support and also do not forget rhianna toolkit matters most
1 per my understanding new laws do give options private buyers and farmers deal directly and which as mentioned correctly in video may cause buyers dictate terms in certain aspects however concept of apmc not being eradicated and parallel system that being created provide more options farmers still at helm and ones who decide which route they wish choose please correct me if i am wrong
i support kisan protest from east u p
afghan will become peacful country in world soon taliba not robots they also have lost their families they doing this all for peace we want this in pakistan too
how they beating old farmers shame pm modii shame kisaaan ekha zindabaad
these not real farmers of india but mostly commission agents and middlemen from punjab state of india
such shame on government modi and one sided indian media
thanku bbc for covering true thanku ur not like godimedia thanku for understand farmer pain
no farmers
so bjp workers human and so called farmers human so both should be equally treated
our farmers have once again showed how win by protesting peacefully
assertion bjp fearing lose up and punjab elections
real news what this support and help farmers
taliban government v ehna vadia shame on haryana gov
well sad agriculture our wisest pursuit because will in end contribute most real wealth good morals happiness being human should support farmers truly appreciable entire team for such efforts

bjp will not loose anything but this defeat of those farmers who were not getting msp benefits and also apmc market for their crops poor farmers will be poor no one will ever dare do any improvement in farmers by laws
image of modi ji has not been stunned by any of farmers
everyone at fault farmers capitalists government everyone and sad thing none of them concerned about issue just money and mandi issues for them no one looking at bigger picture of works they doing and have done in past
this real picture of profit and loss of three bills brought by govt for welfare of farmers no doubt these three bills against of middle men of mandies who were going rich rich and kissan were going poor poor
first step towards d grade punjabi farmers
government should form committe look into farm sector who shall talk various kisan organisation feedback and get them into new laws
there no mistake with farm laws mistake repealed as acceded middlemen disguised as farmers pressure this india fate that common people being ignorant and not knowing whichever of their benefits usually mislead and exploited by some scammers and perpetrators if real farmers were in heaven because of mandi system why 1000s of them committed suicide every year
should have gone and dried farmers anyway getting cold so let have fun
do not defend farmers by saying they not farmers
anyone with modicum of knowledge of market economy knows these reforms good for farmers
if we remove certain items from that list then prices will go high daily use items like oil cereals etc legalizes storage of those items govt should remove that from bill and its all good
first massive victory of indian farmers after 2014 independence
and i support this law but this not right time for implementation because of lack of awareness among farmers government should start some courses for farmers and educate them how improve in their skills and manufacture some products at home
all farms bill so far just benefited panjab not other states of india
2 also farmers get farm subsidies for electricity water fertilisers and even seeds with mandi collapsing state tax revenue gone this means no subsidies that will cause havoc btw agro subsidies big part of west has 2 effects 1 skews markets beyond recognition in favor of lobbyists like corn etc 2 must have since farmers cant survive without result has not helped farmer survive its not free market and effect on environment beyond repair indian subsidies on other hand way more effective since helps out v poor farmer and free of lobby pressures at least when compared west we need solve indian problem here not western
i am not farmer today i feel proud be punjab
punjab farmers rich and bigger so they do not need worry but imagine of small farmers who going die of hunger again
as soon as took out indian flag no true indian in favour of no support from now
indian police deserve this kind of treatment i support kissan
rakesh ji congress party join congress pradhanmantri banega rakesh
bills were all right but way was implemented was wrong without discussion in parliament cannot just ram through bills sadly farmers do not see writing on wall paddy farming will go on in punjab and haryana ground water levels will fall and in future areas would slowly become arid as going on today
all tractors used in protest should be given poor farmers of odisha and bihar
wow what gesture of solidarity towards farmers family playing politics with someone real affection

2 third bill intention was bring third party organization into farming and protect farmers from famine and other natural disasters while also increasing diversity of agricultural products which currently very limited due lack of certainty in post harvesting incomes looking at how much wheat production increasing in up mp and punjab and how mp recently crossed 300 mt of wheat production in year 20 21 which getting wasted due very poor storage facilities so clarity would come from proper dialogue with farmers and curbing weak areas of laws make them legible and clearer which i think goi tried up some extent but we all saw what exactly happened if implementation of these bills had been effective with proper clarity then would have made farmers more confident and secure so they could have started thinking toward other farming options and processes and may eventually shift towards organic farming as well

they will not even leave farmers until they bring farming sector ground like gdp automobile politics
salute indian farmers
had three farm statutes not provided benefits private firms modi govt would not have come up with them
incentivise farmers wean them away from wheat and rice edible oil producing crops good solution
i have few points make based on my understanding of farm laws even though there were lot of reforms in them there were few clauses that were absolutely unfair farmers and would hurt thier welfare first was dispute resolution mechanism which was clearly not thought of second was lack of oversight and regulation in terms of coorperate agricultural contracts and third was lack of price discovery mechanism based on market supply and demand constraints only states where mandis system properly implemented were ones which protested and majority of rest of farmers in country anyway being exploited by local traders who advantage of simple fact that mandi too far away and most farmers do not have access them
whereas farmer who not allowed economy of scale by law supposed produce food at internationally competitive price
mr modi look after india farmers blood of india thier forefathers sacrificed themselves for mother india bring country together

this big failure of bjp government even after nine months of struggle convey their grievances still farmers struggling on roads but insensitive government least bother address public grievances important part of nation farmers who in service of providing food has least respect than players who in none productive work get more attention

dhruv if reading this loan clearing big big scam run by farmers themselves i know my own family and friends who deliberately loans and never never pay even one emi even though they have good incomes and wait for state elections once state elections arrive everything boils down candidate who offering waive off loans do we white collar jobs have headache of paying off taxes when farmers enjoy maximum subsidies no doubt that few of cases would be authentic but complete system failing on ground of ethics
