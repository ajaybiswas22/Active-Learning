Farmers are selling to corporates from years this law's just make procedure more visible. Corporates don't want to buy from small farmers.,0

"6. Food security undermined? Right now our buffer stocks are 90 million tonnes of food grains while we need only 41 million tonnes of food grains. Therefore we are already food surplus. We are now producing 1.75 kg food grains per capita per day, while we need hardly 1/2 kg (500 gms) of food per capita per day. In addition our Nominal protection coefficient is on an average 0.87 indicating that we can export and earn 13 percent higher price abroad. Therefore all the 3 laws are useful for farmers. There may be need for some small changes such as approaching civil court for dispute resolution, and these may be accommodated. Else the entire Act in its entirety is helpful to farmers.",0
"Shame on you ,4 farmer died ,and you noting said about this",1
"To add to your presentation, current system is flawed that Govt never made serious effort to create sustainability for farmers rather used them to solve its problem of revenue loss due to import of rice and wheat in past. In that process Govt exploited or made farmers to exploit water of Punjab to a level that soon Punjab will be without drinking water if current system continues. With new laws Govt absolves itself completely from the responsibility  of making farming sustainable partly because current Govt is incapable of governance and partly because current Govt. ruined revenue structure badly with demonetization and flawed GST. Now Govt wants private corporations to make decisions for the benefit of farmers and this is the most laughable solution offered by Govt for the 'Benefit' of farmers. ",1
Ok but why don't you mention that police had even blocked the road which was agreed for the farmers rally. Why being one sided?,1

"Now, corporates can store the grains for as long as they want because the new bills also exclude grains and rice from the essential commodities act which stopped them from doing so. Now the corporates will control the market price. They can keep the grains for as long as they want and as much as they want. Maybe the market is low and the price for grains is less, so the corporates will stop the supply. And according to a very mere theorem of economics - Less supply, More demand so more rates of these essential commodities. Moreover these government will buy less grains from now onwards so the food which was earlier rationed is also going to eventually stop.",1

"Shekhar Gupta casually compares Alaudin Khilji's price control to MSP, while at the same breath explaining how it was the maximum price set for soldiers (not minimum). This approach lacks intellectual rigour.  You can draw baseless comparisons of every economic and social policy with some practice that occurred centuries ago.  Most of Indian laws, policies and acts are based on something or the other introduced by the British. This does not necessarily undermine the contemporary relevance of any law or Act nor does it make it particularly special. What Shekhar Gupta should question is why is the Centre adamant on implementing these Acts even when the states have shown that they can easily reform it to suit their own situation (which he seems to be using as his primary argument).",0

No, but here farmers also educated, i want to give one example in Karnataka for 1kg of onion is priced between  60 to 70Rs but the farmer who grow the onion will get only 20 to 25 per kg but the broker will get profit upto 30 per kg how strange it is the broker will get more profit compared to farmers or customers, this 3 laws are passed to prevent these unethical fraudulent agriculture market but some idiots like rakesh tikayath diverted the reasons behind these laws, so first try to educate don't follow dumb people.",0

But what the opposition did is also a bit questionable as there violence was not required. In fact violence karne se wo bill nai rukta. Kya fayeda hua ? Bill to pass ho hee gaya na. Gussa nikalne se bill to nai ruka. isliye in my opinion, violence nai karna chahiye tha. Mic nai toddna chahiye tha kyunki wo karne ka koi fayeda nai hai. Its not the solution. In fact they should go to the court and challenge this bill on how it was passed. That would be the right way. And they should protest and do dharnas. Thats the right way, not violence.

"If we go by explanation in video then only best option is to make MSP a legal right of every farmer. As we are already assuming that private player will be giving better rates than what government has been offering than why not set a MSP limit before hand. As per assumption only rich farmers from Punjab and Haryana are getting benefit of MSP,  then why not pass this benefit to every farmer of country by providing legalised MSP even for buying private market.",1
"Excellent analysis shekhar sir, although I am a modi supporter but I still like your unbiased comments coz your comments and analysis of any national issue is well balanced. I am also of the same view on farm laws, laws are beneficial and in the interest of farming community. But main problem is big farmers of punjab and arhtiyas. I've been to punjab these arhtiyas are very influential people who are themselves big farmers, they earn huge Amount of commission every year from afmc. They will never allow other marketing institutions to come up, secondly parali burning is an issue but perhaps govt came under pressure from SC on the issue. When govt is ready to make necessary changes, then why they are adamant. They don't represent farmers of entire country. And this is nothing but gundagardi that we will block delhi.",0

"Since when did a free market become a bad thing?  Farmers in India shy away from growing organic produce and choose to grow sub-standard GMO crops because of MSP. Since they know the quality is of no relevance, any quality is supported by the government promised minimum support price. A free market leads to competition amongst producers, better investments in products which are relevant to market demand (take the example of avocado across the world), sustainable profitability for producer and also better quality product at a better price for the consumer. A product like rice cannot be monopolized by a large corporate, because if that is true then Amul has already monopolized the milk industry in India. Are the milk producers getting fair value for their product? Yes, because if Amul won't pay the local producers a fair price someone else will, or the milk producers will sell directly to the customer, which they do even now. The farmer protests are based on fear-mongering and unfortunately, a small percentage of educated class is also standing in their support out of confirmation bias, just because it gives them an opportunity to reaffirm their hate towards a political ideology.",0
It's mean it is clear that private players want to purchase farmers  crops less than MSP,1
Similarly jab kisan ye bills nhi chahte to kyu unpar ye thope jaa rahe hai?? ,1

"13) The farmers simply rejected every offer for a clause by clause threadbare discussion & were trying to dictate to the Govt! Their attitude was ""My way or Highway""! Clearly, they were never interested at all! Now that people are against them & they are fearing a backlash, they are saying ""violence never solved anything & they are ready for talks"". Get lost! The time for discussions is gone!",0
"What all need to understand is, india has many small landless farmers who are also uneducated and don't know about market or laws. Their produce is also less to sell in wholesale market. As a result they end up selling it to big so called farmers and very very low price. Which is then sold on to mandies, which by the way is also controlled by these big so called farmers. Small farmers can't sell in mandies even if they want to.The whole protest is to make sure that those small farmers don't get access to free market. And they can be exploited by the big powerful so called rich farmers. Honestly, I feel the mob accumulated as farmers are not farmers, thats a paid mob. You can buy anything, including mob. Hence education is necessary for all, that includes you as well. Please read these laws Mr #TrevorNoah",0

"People should be wise while voting, because what is spoken today, if the same thought was thought almost one year back about the farmers, there wouldn't have been so many deaths among the farmers. Now, the main reason is the forthcoming elections. The farmers as well as other citizens must be very careful in voting and selecting their leader. One should not believe in floral speeches. Floral speeches are given when something is behind it. We pray that God bless our country's citizens with God's wisdom and not human wisdom. After so many farmers being killed, wives lost their husbands, husbands lost their wives children lost their fathers and mothers, how can a leader of our country replace these losses and forgetting all these things giving such floral speeches will not help people. God bless our country! ",1

"I think that the bill had two flaws- (1) The removal of MSP outside APMC market , which is bad. (2) the non-interference of the government in sale of agricultural commodities outside APMC , i.e., in private markets. There could have been strict laws according to how private companies can enrich the farmers rather than impoverish them for their own profit making purposes. For companies charging less than MSP, there can be strict tax laws or penalties for them. ",1
Both should co exist.  For farmers to get max price.,0
For inter state selling. ..pls tell me Sir...if a farmer from punjab comes to West bengal and sell his potatoes....how much will the farmer face hassles and whether potato per kg will remain at Rs14 a kilo? Then the consumers will have to buy at Rs50 a kilo. Is this is not against the consumer ?,1

I can understand India's government wanting to modernize it's agriculture sector. An average of one person managing only 3 acres of land is crazy inefficient by modern standards. It also ties up a great deal of the Nations work force in just Agriculture. I understand why they would be upset. They have all lived this way for a long time and change creates uncertainty for a lot of those Farmers future and asks a lot of them. But it seems that if standard of living is going to improve in India. Something will need to change.,0

So,  worth a try. Before anyone commenting on the topic please download the Farmers bill 2020 and study it carefully from every angle. If you want to understand what the bill projects you can see it in the explanation given as a guide to IAS studies by Dhristi IAS - Farmers bill 2020 which has explained all angles attached to the bill in 3 hours.

Like that there will be more than 1000 Processing units for a particular food commodity.... it's an open secret, No need for any proof also.......now This Commission need not be paid according to this bill...... That is why MLAs and MPs of Punjab and Haryana are fighting,that they will loose their share of money .......Its been more than 20-30  yrs that Yeswantapur APMC yard has been constructed..... Even now that yard stinks and water enters the stores when it rains heavily, other APMCs yards across India will be even worser.... When it comes to MSP pricing, Govn hasn't scrapped that since APMCs are still functional according to this bill, So, farmers can still get their MSP when trade fluctuation happen........If so is the situation, Framers of Maharashtra, AP, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, MP, UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, are not fighting when law was implemented .......it is in recent days that many states are getting involved......... People should Have also fought  Against NMC bill( For destroying health sector by Reducing quality of Doctors by Mixing process- Only doctor community came for support, rest people are not bothered only ) , Demonetization, High Price spiking ( Petrol / Diesel ).....

And no government has. Even able to significantly create jobs where the farming community can be weaned out of farming which is becoming more & more poorer as 86.5% of the farmers have less than 1.5 acre of land and this holding is continuously reducing. You can see the exodus of farmers abroad from Punjab where this is a major reason although some bigger farmers also emigrate due to the quality of life abroad. However majority emigrate as farming is not viable and there are no suitable white collar jobs available elsewhere.,0
"Mr Shekhar, you have very well explained the Paddy and Rice situation in Punjab and Haryana. Thanks for that. I have visited hundreds of Apmc mandis in India and found that hardly small and marginal farmers get the benefits of Mandi system. It is the big farmers get all the benefits and do all dirty politics. The state government have politicised the mandis and look at the Mandi management committees, they're all corrupt political people with their choicest officers. They are also conniving with traders to all kinds of manipulation so that easy money will be there for them. That's why the big farmers Who are also politicians in association with traders and commission agents creating all these problem. Further if you do research you will find that the so called farmer organisations and their leaders do not want farmers to be independent and well of because if farmers get benefits, their leadership will be at stake. These people never tried to motivate the farmers to go for diversification about productive utilisation of water and energy. They misinformed the farmers. Look at the people at dharna place, mostly farmers from Punjab are found. Does it mean that rest of the country farmers are not there? What about people like (,   one) Ravana, people from JNu, Shahinbag, etc. doing there. The slogans and flags and pictures heard and seen there is seriously disturbing. Thanks Mr Shekhar.",0

develop the system & confidence.

This open market policy is not new it is already there in many states even in my state of Tamilnadu it's already there that's y my AIADMK government is not opposing the bill. In many other states it's already there now it's becoming act that's all. In Punjab farmers currently farmers  can only sell to Mandis no open market policy  there that's y they are protesring that means middle men are higher and state government is heavily dependent on Mandi charges. This shows that more than the farmers Middle men are more affected.That doesnt mean there were no issues for farmers yes there but like water shortage and some other issues. I support the government wholeheartedly in this.,0
We r with farmer,1

"I think this is great for Indian Democracy; I am not an expert on the farm laws but I leave it to the expert; I am only examining the functioning of Democracy in India; Imagine since BJP took over for every thing they pass an Ordinance. Which means they do not want any discussion at all. Second, the President is signing every thing and never on a single occasion questioned why the urgency for the Ordinance? And the way parliament sessions are conducted is even worse; The Speaker/Chairman does not bring any bill for discussion until last minute and then passing them through voice votes!!! Even the way Finance Budget was presented last year was horrible. The FM does not give any details and asks to refer to the Budget addendum for every thing that will be shared after the session; And after the session it was all crap, with no data; Definitely, the current Government does not want to take questions and Accountability; Democracy is failing in India and if that continues, we will end up the way like China.",1

"Really loved the way the part where 94% farmers who till today sell their crops at prices way less than MSP(MSP for paddy - 1925/quintal, average selling price - 1400-1450/quintal) was conviniently ignored by you(Dr. Sharma mentioned it around 6:40). Saying 'Main sirf un points pr focus krta huun jinko lekr kisaan naraz hain' won't take in account why the majority of farmers are not protesting. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT ASSURING MSP IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD FOR THE FARMERS but giving MSP to only 6% farmers from majorly Punjab and Haryana doesn't do justice for the other 94%. I also fear the monopoly of large corporates in buying the produce but it will still be way higher than what 94% farmers get today.",0

"Micro farming or marginal farming is not a sustainable method to be used in this century. We need big companies to organise the farming in an industrial scale. How many poor farmers committed suicide recently due to heavy loss suffered in crops. We need to improve infrastructure in farming business. The final benefit will definitely go to the farmers. They can use advanced technologies in farming. No one will loose their land, farmers will earn more than what they get now. Look at the developed countries, farming is done at large scale. Implementing the new farming bill will eradicate the food scarcity in our country and we will be self sufficient in this field.",0

"Agree that MSP is also not sustainable.  An alternative is to abolish MSP and increase subsidies on farm inputs like fertilizers, seeds, pesticides and encourage collective farming at the panchayat level whereby productivity multipliers like tractors, harvesters etc - the costs of which - can be shared by the whole village equitibly.  The govt will get more bang of its buck this way.",0

The farm laws were good why did u repeal it Sir ,0
Just went through the comment section below and observed that the majority of the people are very obsessed about the BJP and RSS. Though in this entire incident no connection of RSS has been visualized. Not even any media house established any connection between this Incident and RSS yet. But it seems they are seriously prone to misconceptions and consequently making a premature attempt to amalgamate a sacared organization with this tragic incident. Such organizations are mostly indulge into the selfless services. And it's always galling to see when people blame the victim to be ruthless. This should not be done.,0
I believe this is a political masterstroke on BJP's behalf. There are elections in Punjab and UP in 2022 so ek teer do nishaane for the BJP.,0

2) Why is it that only farmers from Punjab are protesting against the bill ? Is it because the bill does away with the taxes which were levied if produce was sold outside of the APMC mandi ?,0

A relevant question .has any organisation of farmers asked for such law for them?,1

It also providesbenefitsfor the small and marginalfarmerswith less than five hectares of land.,0

"Holistic organic farming is the key to India's Food Security but at the same time the plutocracies surrounding Indian farmlands and contractual labour and the entrapment done by APMC traders should also be looked into and also state govt. have the power to bypass the farm bills, so the protest don't make sense. I think one should look at the data that comes out from the states that have implemented the new act after some years and then make any judgement regarding the same.",0
West U.P farmers also participating in the protest from starting and in huge number. Media is not covering west up farmers because they wanna portray only Punjab farmers are having problem,1

"Main reason for protest IMHO is the way the bills/ordinance/law was pushed through. The closest analogy I can think of is if someone barges into a house with a suitcase  that he claims are goodies for the occupants, any occupant would ask him to take his goodies and get out. If the intruder says, I will not open the suitcase but leave it her unopened for 18 months, the occupants would still say get out. How many of us have had the experience where someone barges is without knocking, maybe with something official or legal. We would insist the person get out, knock and walk in only after you give permission. In such circumstances (if its true) nothing else but repealing the laws will work. And the longer the inevitable is prolonged, the more the risk of something flaring up and things going beyond everybody's control. And also the more it is prolonged, it only makes the opposition stronger.",1

Modi ministers and bJP party has done more harm than farm laws by calling these people names. The rural areas in these states were core bJP supporters (and its allies) we were telling from the beginning that this fight with its own people is completely unnecessary and that too over these farm bills. Now you can argue about their benefits but again on ground the concerns were real.

This will be a win for bjp if they just not let INC show it as their victory.,0
Please note it's middleman win by opposition support and true small farmers lost today,0
"Farmers don't only live in Punjab and haryana , no one is protesting in north east India or south India ",0
This is rise of Sikh Taliban (khalistani) .,0
Farmers are fearing that Agriculture  also has been privatised. Who is great in this country. People or people elect law makers.  If it is good and flawless why do you need promotion? what will the voiceless people of this country do now?,1
Glad to know the usually anti modi comment section here knows the bill is good for farmers and not just oppose it because opposition is doing so.  Thanks for the rationality and sensibility,0
Kick out Achedin Terrorist Govt....Jai Kisan,1
Congratulations to Mr. Punya Prasun vajpeyi sir for your great anchoring in support of farmers ,1
Shame on you  zee. Those who killed 5 farmers are innocent shame on you,1
We are getting potatoes today at Rs 40 per kg and how much does the farmers get? You will be surprised.,1
Sir excellent explaining but this kisaan bill  not nice,1
"Firstly, as your video says only 6% of farmers sold in APMCs, why are they now even bothering about something that they never cared about?? West Bengal is the largest producer of vegetables in India. Can't see anyone from WB protesting. and lastly... Nowhere in the bill says that it is in favour of companies. Neo-liberalism is a tangent from this topic.",0
Im not born or raised in India but I know the issues formers have and no government leave there ppl to die in cold weather if the government cant take care of there ppl then government should be removed.other thing Indian media have no guts to say truth if you live in USA or Canada media allot to speak all the best to farmers,1
"True and faithful kisan,farmers will not behave like this,its motivated and political agenda..",0
The committee members are not farmers. They are economists scientists etc who support the tycoons entering the agriculture market with money and technology. Now the farmers are depending on fertiliser pesticides. When modern technology comes agriculturists will have to depend for genetically modified seeds also. They have to buy at price fixed by these companies. Modern machinaries will come which the small farmer cannot afford. They have to sell their lands and become menial workers in the city losing their divinity. And we consumers have to eat all dangerous grains which will affect our health. Thecpharma companies hospitals and stick market will be happy .,1
Amazing video series. Very proud of ur true journalism. Godi media murdabaad. We need a media revolution also,1
"1) A farmer cannot go to the court when there is a conflict between a trader and a farmer. Don't you see it as a problem, given the extent of corruption in India, SDMs can be easily bought by bigger corps/government?",1
"Beautifully explained. The intentions of the govt are good , no doubt about that. Why communication is not adequate or is it because farmers are being fed on wrong or misleading communication. ",0
"Were they able to convince demonitisation  to public,before and after it.sorry.this is not first instance,they have taken u turn earlier also.in farmer land bill.",1

Thanks alot Samdish Sir for your support and reporting .m from punjab and being a farmer's daughter initially we all were panic about our future but now it seems with real media's support we will definitely win.and one more thing the way you use punjabi accent is really nice ,1
Farmers in the Other Parts of India don't have a single problem and why do these punjab farmers have a problem? Congress the opposition government is creating chaos in India against BJP and Narendra Modi. And the Farmers of the Rest of the India came to protest against these farmers protesting for no reason. Making innocent faces won't  make you great and develop stympathy for these fake farmers in no smart person's heart. These are Khalistani people and kisan andolan is just a name but they are the Khalistani supporters. These people protested with the Khalistani flag in USA also at the same time and they said it was all linked and planned.,0
Zee news is BJP news,1
"The government and the famers should have watched this video. The farms laws were a progressive step,  leaving aside a few doubtful provision, But the government made its own work difficult by name calling the farmers. Had it treated them with respect, this issue would have been solved",0
Very goos explanation. It seems..the new ruleas are not in favour of farmers as the protesters say.,1
There could have been some changes but farmer's haat made joke of a full-majority  government in front of the world .....,1
When compared to the cruelties of Kattar to farmers this is nothing .,1

No farmers no food no feature,1
Farmers protesters are creating more trouble. The murder was not done a single person. Group was involved. But now Farmers protesters are in trouble and Surrendered one suspect. But entire Farmers Group are nit peaceful protesters.  Rakash takit are causing great pain to all road users in public. Rakesh takit if you have guts and talent.  Contest elections and repeal the farms laws. But instead blackmail or threatened has caused the Farmers protest as a mockery and hidden agenda of Congress and TMC or Owassi.,0
Wrong Bill should not implement ..People who supports this bill dnt know how it will affect farmers in future .They will be doing slavery for private company ..if the company does not like their crops they can reject what will then a farmer do they can also go in debts also private company can take their land for improving the quality ..Hum log ko sara kuch pata nahi hota bill me hai kya aur Modi k support me aajate,1
Modi import everything in india to cooperative societies india railway  airlines airport also soled,1

Farmers are spine of our country.... Central govt battled agianst Indian citizens.... Never giveup...,1
Love from Kissans more called by media ( Khalistanis ) ,1
MSP should be for BOLR (Buyers of Last Resort) will usually be a percentage lower than the market price. But what farmers are asking for is BOFR (Buyers of First Resort). Doesn't make sense.,0
Please make video on 1984 also and they did not  even Touch or disrespect our national flag. Please make video on since how many days framers are sitting there . One farmer were killed by Police headshot but not single police man were killed.please show the number how many framers were injured also. ,1

How peaceful these Farmers are,0
Police Vs farmers.      Both are backbone of our country but main villain is Modi sarkar who giving orders to police and watching this,0
Farmer is farmer irrespective from which state they come and serve with one motive to feed the country,1
"Modiji Is not opened to Discussion, this ",0
This would have made India top agriculture exporter. It would have increased farmers income.,0
"I'm here before people start calling Trevor ""pakistani"" and ""khalistani""",1
"there is no problems by other states of india except these 2 states PB and HNY. these states were one who were exploiting the green reform laws as well as MSP. thus the new law had provision for poor farmers and these peoples, acquiring a huge land area are forcefully trying to make things hard for gov",0

I understand all points ...but there was also picture of farmers using sword over policemen ....what about those things....that was not good thing too,0
"Recommended resolution: Empowering farmers to lead by experimentation, build consensus and make choices rather than embracing contract farming as the only option. Farmers can yield trust-worthy results by understanding problems from all prospectives. Explore broader ranges and allow leads to more innovative solutions that address underlying factors.",0

Don't say like this to farmer,1
It's unfortunate of India that farmers could not understand their interest because of Rakesh tiketand other leaders.,0
Finally zee news wake up for farmers matters after 2 months,1
Few things need mending in this but overall these ordinances are very good for the farmers ,0
I personally will still vote for the BJP coz I haven't found anything yet to go against them in these farm Laws.,0
1. A rural uneducated farmer can't bargain their  crop's price with big industrialists.,1
Totally concocted stories from everywhere. Absolute disregard for the farmers. Politics only. The opposition has no clue on how to oppose a popular govt. ,0
"Thanks for covering, plz support farmers..... waheguru sareya da bhala kare",1
I'm with farmers ,1
He actually said something opposite what farmer leaders are saying,0
Most people here or even  you have not the plight of farmers in Europe so no point in following them in the first place as far as agriculture goes!,0
"I personally have just one issue with this analysis, which is to treat the word ""farmers"" as a homogeneous group. I believe all analysis on farmers' issues will become much more nuanced once we start categorising different types of farmers based on their landholdings, mechanisation, labour employed etc. The status quo definitely benefits some stakeholders (otherwise it wouldn't have existed) and any reform will hurt this category. At the end of the day, if the reform hurts the richest category of farmers marginally in the short run, while increasing the options for the most marginal category of farmers, then it comes down to who do you support in this scenario.",0
No farmers No food,1
Modi should give one more good news by resigning from the post n handover it to someone educated like Swamy or someone else. Next he will sell india to Ambani or some rich clients.,1
We say a big No to the Ambanisation of agriculture. We all stand in solidarity with our farmers.,1
My advice to farmers . Stop  selling your goods to the market for  6 months  or more than a year. grow your necessities for your self .. then the government will come down to your knees.  The farmers are back bone ... all the people  in India should  suffer from food . Then we will know the pain of the farmer. .. please support ... If you agree,1
Justice for our farmers,1
Fearing 4th generation warfare this decision is good however government should be more strict with people as this farm law was game changer for true kisaan,0
I feel that this agriculture reformed bill proposed by Gov. needs some changes & amendments to ENSURE that our most diligent & hardworking farmer brothers get their truly deserving  rewards:,0
"If you wanted to see these day, then what was the lack in Congress?  Home guard under haryana police sub inspector take bribe every time, I suffered from these many times.  Even these days.  I had done electricity theft complaint but no action taken, even they open my name, this is happen Under BJP government.  Now I hate bjp government and their partiality policy.  No value for honest civilian.",0
farmers and government should come to middle ground directly rejecting laws will only make any reform in any sector in India difficult.,0
"It is after all a case of supply and demand. If there is excessive supply of any commodity the price goes down and there is suffering . Since independence no proper planning ,no industrial planning and Governments drifting like driftwood.",0
2. The price of the commodities even now is not government regulated. Government intervenes only if the prices go too high or too low. In order not to let either of the parties incur the loss. And farmers are not always going to sell or selling at loss. Only in certain situations they are. However government clarified that MSP will not be removed which means the farmer is always protected. He can sell in APMC if there's steep fall else he can earn more in the open market. ,0
Modi regime is worst than dictatorship. Independence for Punjab is the only solution,1
"Time will answer that this revoke has deeper reasonings and the true losers would be the farmers who would either live a peasent life under mandi traders like tikait or hang to the trees, like always.",0
"I stand with government on the price issue of farm products, all other things farmers win. Because it can help government during draught and famines to control the price.",0
cool journalism .....respect to farmers from Nepal.....all the best for ur rights !!!!,1
Thanks to #GodiMedia.,0
Now Farmers are losing their credibility.,0
The problem in india is to many people on farming so land is very less and so investment power is also less ,1
If Farmer gets MSP then I want minimum wage as per my degree if I don't have job. Ultimately the money is mine too as I'm tax payer from years. I want same respect that farmers are getting. If tax payers stops working just imagine what will happen to country. We taxpayer paid taxes in lockdown also.,0
Where are one's who called farmer's as anthoan Jeeves??,1
Now I would love to see the ndtv who is condemning US parliament attacks and the people who did the riots on the republic day and every farmer leaders should get punished these are the desperate times govt. should single out every one and punsih them for their deed,0
"Never Expected Modi to do appeasement politics, more than 800 million people are standing behind him as a rock & he is still going round and round on his issues, poor judgment by modi, he should understand if we want to appriciate gandhian ideology or balancing act politics we would have goven vote to congress instead bjp.",1

"They are not farmers.... A true indian farmer would never hurt indian people... They are rioting and damaging public property, causing distortion among people, vandalising streets.....

Master plan.so later people won't blame EVM and GODI MEDIA can tell u that modi g won caz he think about farmers and poor people thats why people vote him .,1
"BJP and Congress both have expressed the issues with 'APMC' mandi having lots of issues. Kerala n many other states do not use the Mandi. Rice grower of Kerala are not protesting. The projected roles of Adatiya being glorified by this lady. Why is this protest , since the large growers of wheat do not know the tax payer money of 33000 crores , which was coming to the states, what will happen ? Govt has been buying the wheat , its reaching the PDS shops via APMC and not that all the goods sold is class 'A'. In fact the PDS ration shop wheat is not palatable by a common man.  This means a good grower of wheat lets say 100 quintals , in reality is selling 200 quintals in APMC ( out of which 100 is stones and not real wheat ). Then the money related to this wheat , goes to middlemen and farmers.  Ashirvad atta company or similar ones do not buy this wheat.  When farmer dumps his wheat in APMC mandi , who finally buys it from there and where does the wheat gets utilised , has the real answers for this protest.  Why does Govt still imports despite bumper crop ( or farmer does not export ) , if he has done excellent quality and has a fear of the price drop. ??? Few questions are based on fears. These are away from reality...On ground , the news channel should visit APMC ware houses and show the pictures of rats and rotten wheat laying , lack of disposal in time and usage. That will clear all the muck. The channels are not spending time to show real ware house conditions.",0
congratulations to farmer for their great victory..,1
Mo one has instigated farmers they are struggling to go protest in Dehli,1
"I'm not against or for the laws. But I think you must make a video explaining in detail the complete law. As I can see is that you had done pick and choose of only parts which look negative. I'm sure there must be protection given to farmers which no body is explaining. Initially the series was well explained about the Green Revolution but as it came down to Laws, it seems to be biased.",0

"There is another loophole with msp ( my thoughts, plz enlighten if otherwise) msp is to encourage farmers to grow specific crops that otherwise are not so lucrative. If msp is enforced will it not stop the farmers to try new crops and be in the loop of ensured msp crops. We were importers of wheat and paddy and now we are growing them in excess. Probably it's high time to give msp on pulses and oil seeds instead. ( Or similar crops which come under basic needs and are imported)",0
Haths off to effort being put in to beautifully portray the core reasons of the #farmerprotest.,1
"after listening to PM Modi announcement, it broke my heart that my INDIA will have to suffer....... as its medicine (agriculture reforms) will be taken back  just because some large farmers and middlemens were shortsighted and  thinking about short term profits rather then the pain & sufferings of there brother's who doesn't own large farms and sometimes even can't able to make there daily livelihoods.",0

Why wouldnt they clash with the police after one year of camping on the streets, not eating properly,suffering harsh cold weather, 700 Sikhs have died in the peaceful protests. How many governement officials died? A clash is nothing after a year of being treated like sub humans AFTER THE Sikh holocoust of 1984 and sikhs being kidnapped tortured and killed by the governement on a regular basis. Sikhs have shown their insane amount of patience camping outside for ONE WHOLE YEAR whilst the WORLD MEDIA AND GOVERNMENTS have FAILED to report propey on the Largest Protests in History. 700 dead for the rights of farmers. The Indian governement wanted this to drag on, and were probably waiting for Sikhs to give up, but Sikhs are warriors, taught not to give up. They have suffered the most inhumane indignities and atrocities by the Indian Governement yet continue to endure.",1

"under the new Bills, the contracting farming approach does not guarantee MSP, it's suggested. that's one of the fundamental demands from the farmers. Several political leaders (example: Haryana CM) are misleading the people. if the Govt really wants to help the farmers, they should work with farmer organizations to improve the existing APMC system. they should see the Swaminathan Commission report for recommendations (official study done by govt 2004-2006).",0

Lakhimpur case is nightmare for all farmers and Indians.  Arnab discuss on  this. Don't shout discuss. No one like to burn fellow Indians. It's your wrong notion,1

#supportfarmers  most of these police personnel are from farmers families,1
BJP comes in power  2019 on the promise of this farms law now they backed of,0
I have a point to add the claim from the farmer that he had sold his crops say for 4 dollars per kg its less than his father's but it fails to acknowledge the fact that the overall produce of the farmer per acre land has also increase. people dont account for that.,0
I am sorry I was quite annoyed with AA Mitra by listening him in your 7.5 years of governance praising Modi's popularity left watching episode but to day dare to see this episode me 200 percent agree with thought of Shri Mitra many times I have indicated above opinions in my comment though I have voted bjp but never believe on them convey my regards and excellent analysis by Abhijit ayyer Mitra ji,0

"Farmer needs reforms and support from governments especially,",0
I am not a farmer even I have agriculture land and supporter of Kisan Morcha from the beginning. I suggest you to open Toll Plaza as it must effect the development of Punjab in future. It is my humble request only.,1
Full support to farmers standing up for their rights,1
Us punjabis and Sikh love our country and thousands of Sikhs enroll in the Indian Army and give their lives away every year. But when they speak up against the government then theyre Khalistanis. Modi ke bhaktton sharam karo Tum iss desh ki development kharab kar rhhe ho Tum desh se nahi sirf Modi se pyar karte ho,1
*Why should police be caught in this trap set by the politicians      Police should stand down. Let the Farmers  & politicians protesting disrupt service & clash with public. Let public feel the brunt. Public will be upset and take action against protestors*,0
"This opposition is totally shit...earlier they want that this Law should be remove and now when the Parliament repeal the bill they need discussion... on such bills...this shows their mind set ....opposition doesn't want peace always opposing, and shouting....in the house...",0
I had a huge confusion regarding why only punjab n haryana are against the laws. We never se uttarakhand or himanchal or bengal( rice max) bihar protesting for months. Now I am clear ,0
If govt has passed this bill to give benefits to the farmers. If in case in future somewhere if farmers incurred some loss due to this bills then govt duty to change as per the need. It is not compulsory that only bjp has to do it. It has to be done by the party who is in power. All time opposing is not the solution it will always keep us backward.,0
But let's wait for his next innovative steps for the welfare of farmers..,0
16k  such people watched the video who are not dependent on farmers for their food,1
I have lost all sympathy for the farmers now. Only Law can give justice to Lakhbeer Singh.,0
"People who are bragging about peace and protest, they do not know that the farmers were on roads for more than 4-5 months. Happiness and rights are not restricted to industrialists or politicians, the farmer who worked for his whole life for the country's hunger is left with injustice and cruelty. Being a sheep is easy but fighting for your rights is not for everyone' caliber. Kissan Majdoor Ekta zindabad ",1

Ambani don't try to play game with farmer of Punjab ,1
What about farmer bettan by  stone in protest by bjp activist and shaking hand with Delhi police....,1
farmers need our support to defeat godi media,1
Can believe that India is producing double the amount of food grains that we actually need. Its high time that we go back to Organic farming just the way our Grandfathers used to do farming with traditional compost and not urea.,0
"Continued  started selling their produce directly to Mill owners from punjab, chatisgarh, mp. These mill owners come directly and purchase stock from villages itself, farmers don't need to transport their paddy. Moreover farmers are made instant payment. Almost 90% farmers sell their products directly to Mill owners and fci purchases very small stock. So, this both bills are very good for farmers, I don't understand Congress which made promise in their manifesto to introduce these changes is now backing out. This is nothing but just oppose the bill since you are against the govt.",0
I just love to see congress and Aam Aadmi party supporters arguing against Modi for their personal reasons on the other hand the response of Bhakts are also incredible.,1
Agriculture Reforms had to be done by consulting with Farmers of all classes in all levels,0
talibani goons causing havoc modiji throw them out,0
Support farmers 100 percent,1
Except the proposals are designed to provide much needed reform to an archaic industry. It's easy to focus on one side of the story but many of the protestors are wealthy Punjab farmers that have benefitted from the subsidies that are available under the current system.,0
States had different rules &regulations to buy food grains frm farmers. It was difficult for corporates to handle so many states with so many different regulations & taxes.,1
Farmer have teach lesson for him he will never forget in his life.And pls don't trust  this feku chacha,1
So call farmer KHALISTAN Lader say with attack in RED FORT this planning BJP gov so with attack in  America  11.9.2001 19 years go that planning BUSH gov      so funny ,0

Shame on the central government...farmers ka sunnane ke liye itna time waste kiya,1
Yeah niw modi govt. Is in official talks with taliban.....,1
HaHa.... Farmers protests. Why didnt you interview the genuine farmers who raised riots on the 26th Jan & injured more than 600 police personnel & disgraced the Red fort & the Indian flag?,0
Taliban should know this is india not Afghanistan govt  feeling sad for Afghan people ,0

"This is the power of democracy,congrats to farmers sitting in protest for last one yr bearing rain,cold n burning sun exposure n heat.",1
If people have minimum wage. Should not the farmers have a fair minimum price for his or her produces? The farmers had to buy seeds and chemicals plus paid rent for the land in order to produce his harvest to sell. ,1
Pathetic situation of farmers of India..no justice is given to them...kya yehi Acche din ki baat k wayda karke vote loote the...shameless attitude of ruling party,1
These 3 farm laws are not only  death warrant for farmers but for indian middle class also.,1
My heartly condolence to farmers,1

They aren't farmers,0
Only 6% farmers get MSP & 86% are small farmers,0

west punjab with east punjab we are with farmars always,1
"3.a. smaller farmers on other hands are extorted off their harvest, due to high interests rates. ",1
Some of the things farmers are asking is irrelevant or wrong like stubble burning permission and subsidy on diesel. These things are not environment friendly and will impact farmers only on longer run,0
before watching this i was opposing kissn but now after watching i just supporting kisan and opposing government neta log kabhi bharat ko develop naho hone dega,1
Mayavati brainless leader. She is chor. Welcome Modiji in Punjab. Hindu dharm ki Jai ho. Jai hind.,0
It's hard to watch this video knowing the fact that it's been a year already and there is no possible resolution yet. government is cutting the hands which are feeding the whole country. it is a major issue of shame for all of us every time a farmer dies in the protest.,1
So what are the main tenets of farmers protest?,0
"22:00 lets assume 10 years down the line, everything turns out as planned, corporates enter the agricultural market, farmers are getting higher prices, there are private mandis all over the country. How will the Indian govt honour its commitment to NFSA. Will it be buying from the corporates. I am sure they will sells the grains to Indian govt at subsidised rates just because those grains are to be distributed among poor",1
"I would request Modiji , you also take loan and give free everything..we don't believe in future , let's think just present.. Desh ka jo hona hai..hone de",1
Universe will do the justice to the martiyerd farmers..,1
We support kisan brothers. Jai kisan,1
"As habituated by greed, most of the farmers will sell only to corporates and most of consumers will buy only from corporates. ",1
For those who support farm laws blindly read above lines. Bihar had already removed APMC Mandi long time ago and see the difference between Bihar and Punjab. ,1
"Unfortunate, of all people Iyer talks ...... He has not understood that people of this country are with Modi and for sure Modi will not succumb to election threats. The people know that he is by far the only person who can take this country in the right direction.",0
"Excellent , truthful and very bold analysis by Iyer . We need a strong leader like Yogiji. Not a leader who takes unilateral wrong decisions for the entire country. No excuses, no defending of the indefensible blunder. What a great shame. Death is better than living in humiliation .",0
Bjp jjp modi chor chor chor chor chor chor chor chor chor chor chor chor chor chor chor chor chor,1
That means these laws were not in favor of farmers and were implemented just like that??? What is the message the Nation should take from it? Extremely confusing ,1
Impending doom in the upcoming elections in two states has forced him to repeal not out of love and concern for the farmers.,1
"With the PM announcing repeal.of the said laws and it certainly rattled the kisan leadership but their purpose was not sovled which was to harrass the govt. as well as to oust BJP from power, in UP/ Uttarakhand & stop its chances,if any, in Punjab.",1
Very bad decision by Modi ji to repel this farm laws. I am stunned by the weakness shown to reward such blackmail by such few middlemen and Khalisthanis to decide the fate of majority of the farmers and Indian industry. This decision will pave way for more such blackmail at every step of this govt. I just hope and pray that this may not prove in future to be written in the annuals of history as a historic blunder by BJP. Its is a senseless harakiri and cowardice shown at the time when battle was turning decisively in your favor. Today i feel sad and i feel like its the victory of bad over good. Today is not a good day for the nation. BJP and Modiji need to course correct as they have invited more troubles. Now everyday they will holed for ransom by few hundred crooks.,0
"""Hundreds of thousands"" Try Hundreds of Millions (It is estimated that anywhere between 100-135 million Indian farmers protested these laws)",1
"Punjabi supporters are pushing  Trudeau to intervene in protest of Farmers. Trudeau should not be involved in India's domestic matters. India is the worlds largest democracy where Minorities have a big voice in comparison to Pakistan and China.  Jai Hind, Vande Mataram.",0
"I am with farmers But whatever happened today, it was shameful. Those who are behind this incident should be punished",1
Good decision by Modi ji,0
Lol still calling them farmers ,0
"Don't call off the protest, until the brokers-dalals are thrown out and poor farmers get their  fair share.",0
apmc are run by middlemen which takes away profits from poor farmers,0
"Using these laws,pakistan and Khalistan supporters misinforming the world by paying the online channels and celebrities.",0
Modi & gang could not read the Farmer's exceptional determination & resolve...,1
violence from a few idiots has undermined the farmers cause. hope this does not give the govt an excuse to go ahead with the bill,1
"DOUBT: Sir, even if the farmers are able to sell their produce to the private players at a higher price, will it not lead to increase in the prices of food grains and in turn lead to inflation?",1
Misinformation has been the soul of this protest. The real reason for farmers' poverty is the aadhtis.,0
Farmers are protesting peacefully from 55 days But the arrogant govt has taken no Satisfactory  action to resolve issue. ,1
"The government has been rather busy talking to egoistic, self declared farmers who waste time and never agree on a thing.",1
#standwithfarmers,1
Plz give peace for  farmers,1
in the whole video you have not said that farmers did wrong and strict action should be taken against them.This tells enough about you,1
Police is not playing garba with those lathi...  They are hitting them and so are the farmers,1
We all South Indian farmers will sit on agitation now to bring back those laws..,0
But to explain whole country .... It is life changing bill to farmers.,0
Thanks for supporting farmers,1
"When the farmers were happy with this bill, you got this bill back.",0
"I don't understand Hindi. But, want to support farmers and those who support them. Just Subscribed.",1
Though I support Kisan Aandolan. ,1
"Manish ji...Like the way you have explained all the issues relating  to Farm Bill 2020.....Appreciate the bold step  taken by the Modi Government....Wish people like you  come forward to explain to the farmers  the advantages  of bringing  this legislation.....They are being misled  by vested interests.....I'm sure the farmers  of this country will trust Modiji,because he will never do anything  that will be against  their interests....",0
Don't judge & trust the politician by sweet words after winning the election they will bring back again the same  bill  against the farmers.,1
Consumers who were going to hit severely by Farm Laws along with Farmers failed to understand the consequences of Laws . Consumers were required to support farmers who remained as silent watchers. We need to help farmers in all respect in future so that even such laws should not effect.,1
"A grand salute to all our beloved farmers. United we stand, divided we fall.",1
Love and respect to up and Yogi ji from Haryana ,0
the media is beholden by BJP no doub about it shame shame to India,1

Modi is not fool who will take bills without knowing politcal impact. ,1
"victory of farmers, ...",1
"the bill seems to be very beneficial for farmers, what basis are they protesting them about. how would the farmers lose, there is so much opportunity around this for building a farmer society and many employment opportunity will also raise in this regard.",0
thnks for supporting farmrrs..i subscribe u nd always be with us,1
If You want Development in India.. There Should be an examination for all the politician before elections.,1
If I would read 1st and 2nd law together....then as per an already signed contract with a company I would never loose a penny as a farmer...either the demand is high or low in the market...its the company's headache...not the farmer's....isn't so?...then my income will not fluctuate....,0
So called khalistani protest not farmers ,0
"These bills are being opposed by all the farmers organisation, multiple farm economic experts not just Congress or political parties. ",1
A big salute to our farmers.. But our dear Prime Minister didn't utter a single word for our 700 farmers who sacrificed their lives for this agitation!!!,1
"Although you guys are doing great job, but you especially dont have a in depth knowledge and grip of the whole thing; for example the 8.5 in Punjab and 6 percent in Haryana tax you mentioned, the farmer never pays that, its the buyer who pays that which is either the government or private sector. Farmer always get the full msp. The bottom line is these laws are devastating to not only farmers but everybody related and will benefit the big corporations only - take it from a farmer. Also I feel your presentation is not that effective, your words lack research. I however, appreciate you and your channel to stand up with the truth",0
"APMC + MSP did bring some happiness to farmers but now it's also being mis-used by monopoly traders.  Need to impose heavy fine on traders if they take crop below msp.  Need reformation but this govt seems trying to remove it totally, it can make farmers situation worst as was before implementation of APMC + MSP.",0
APMC ... can be used as benchmark for setting MSP as a minimum procurement price for the commodities?,0
A shameful act done by government. Lost faith from Modiji,1
Next year Assembly election prep in full swingModi bhai2 Kamal he,1
Congrats farmers ,1
"There is no difference between a farmer, a soldier and a dog in poor india",1
