"People are scared but think if msp as a concept is not removed altogether, and allowed to remain, while giving farmers unlimited, unending choice between apmc and industrialists (it should not be like ""ok but you said you'll go with reliance, so you cant come back to apmc because your deal didnt work out"") there shouldn't be a problem at all.",1

To show the real face of these so called farmer's agitation, Modiji has withdrawn the extremely good agriculture laws. In one single master stroke, Modi ji has taken out the wind from the drama that the Congress/SP/TMC were playing, in the name of farmers. With these reforms our country's farming would have been modernized, market-oriented and highly efficient. This would have meant our farmers would have been prosperous just like in the West.",0

Major success for big farmers (which really r not farmers) and a  big failure for Govt..and their dream tO implement these reforms.,0
"Most of the issues which have been addressed in the video ,govt have already made decision that they will change 10 things in this law and most of the things have been covered what the farmers want but still they are forcing the govt to take the 3 laws fully back. Scoopwhoop should do proper investigation and then put the video out in public.",0
Isn't it funny to see Ex CM of Punjab Capt. Amrinder Ji raising the security concerns now? When he was CM what was he doing then? Wasn't  Security of the state  his duty?

All this dramabazi is to fool the people and score brownie points before the upcoming elections....,0

"Just trash the bills and start working with the farmers ! Why is the Govt so focused in imposing those bills? When the farmers are protesting and saying they don't need it??  Those bills were not discussed properly and were made as law. What nonsense was that ? That's the same happening with every BJP reform which is destroying country""s economy & unity. And after the poor farmers started agitation now the Govt is suggesting ammendmends to the bills. So where is the trust and what were the Govt motives  imposing those bills in the first place?? Just trash those bills first and then talk. Why is the Govt not putting on the listening ears ? This govt is supposed to be for the people right ? I guess its not yet dictatorship here  TRASH the BILLS !!",1

"The assumption behind freeing the farmer from the clutches of nexus, is that freedom to trade, allowing hoarding and contract farming will enable better price discovery, which is doubtful or flawed. But what SG forgets is that the new middleman will be the big corporations which will setup new clutches for the farmer. So its not a watershed moment of reform, rather a watershed moment of transfer of colonization from nexus of buyers, traders and consumers to nexus of big corporations. Farmers will never be able to free themselves. But if this will not save the agriculture sector, nothing else will. This will only push more people out of agriculture in long run and help formalize our economic structure like the rest of the world. Ugly but true way to detox the agri sector. The intent of the government is right.",0

Shame of this type of treatment. Farmers are Andata, they are not Atanwad: But Modi has treated them as terrorist. Modi must be removed from the power and must be trialed to get a sentence of death or let Bharat be divided into 5 parts. That is the end of this RSS Terrorist hijacked Bharat and created a situation of hatred and marginalization: against the policies of Nahro, and Ghandi. This is the start of the movement of Khalistan.

"We are extremely thankful to News Laundry for the nice & clear presentation. Your  talk makes one to get a better understanding of the working system there. Now from what the Govt. says Modi expects everyone to have explicit faith & trust in him since he alone has the best of intentions for the farmers, thats why he has brought these new farm Laws. Okay now if what he means what he says why was the tearing hurry to pass it in the parliament. All the people know how Modi meant and done with the Demonetisation law and GST laws. So after seeing all these affects; how does he expect  the nation to now fully place their full trust in him. Everything  he does will become suspicious. Apart from Demonetisation/GST, everyone knows   how many great Institutions are getting privatised and All Gujarati Corporates  get the benefit. And the list goes on and on  Yet the PM wants to nation to give him our full Trust. Tragedy for the Indians. Jai Hind !",

"Also speak on why did riots started and why did farm leaders condemned these riots..there is no mention of taking away MSP in farm laws...speak on contract farming in UK,USA, CANADA whether it helped or teared families there and why farmers not protesting there",
Farmers must stand united & stick to their demand of officially repealing the farm laws in the Parliament & provide MSP as a guarantee by way of a fresh bill of Parliment.,
Biggest Comedian of Indian ,

"So called Farmers who are involved in agitation, those states are getting MSP benefits for last many years and in these states more than 70% of their produce is procured through MSP. As these farmers dont diversify their cropping pattern and creating havoc for natural resources (depletion of ground water due to frequent irrigation bcoz of low electricity tariff, and increase in water logging areas, burning of paddy straw, poor soil health excess use of fertilisers, etc). and unnecesarily presurrising Central Govt by taking the name of small farmers.

"2. Time 4:45 .. as per my understanding the prices, quantity and quality of the product in contract between the farmer and the buyer is pre-determined as per the law. Hence supply and demand doesnt effect it. As pointed out correctly the surplus produce may not be accepted by the buyer at the same rate however that is where the APMC platform comes into picture again where the MSP is still applicable. Please correct me if I misunderstood the law.",

"Why does the government not provide MSP on other types of crops? Why MSP is provided on crops like wheat only? Is there any reason behind that? If MSP is provided on other types of crops, I think it may encourage our farmers to produce different kinds of crops other than wheat. This will reduce the over-supply of wheat and hence reduce the wastage of wheat getting rotten in storage facilities. There must be some logical reason behind this.",
Sir your last sentence of this video is enough to understand whole matter that  election are near and government have no option to agree with kisan    thanks god for sadbudhi,
"The biggest problem I think is regarding the reduction in the taxes paid to the state government. This can be regulated if each trader( certified/registered) under govt. of India and each Agricultural Society/group (which should register themselves to the respective collecter office of their district soon after their formation within a specific time period) would pay some amount of tax to the state govt. based upon the tariffs decided by the regulating authority. Certainly, this tax should be less than the one which is received from the The Mandi System. ",

We are ending up with large food wastage. Let's not jump the gun and declare the new bill is evil.",

"1.	Ola Example: Your explanation is perfect if we assume that a farmer is going to produce X crop only forever, for example, tomato forever then he is certainly going to get impacted. Being an Ola driver is very different than being a farmer. For buying a car for taxi service you need as low as 3- 4 lacs and the supply of a taxi car is unlimited, but this is not the case with farmland. So, a farmer is going to cycle his/her crops according to the market demand whereas an Ola taxi can only be used as a taxi, and it cannot be converted into a loading vehicle and then back to a taxi.

In Punjab and Haryana  there are Hindu farmers , Sikh farmers Muslim farmers.  in Punjab and Haryana, the farmers are not only from from jatt caste or sikhs, there are also pundits, Brahmins , and dogar farmers in Punjab.  Farmers feed the nation, big companies like Tata, Birla, Reliance, Ebany,  Adnany  . These big companies are  controlling Modi. These bills are designed to   make  each farmer compete against each other so that big companies can buy crops at lowest rate, because farmer will have no option to sell to another buyer due to logistics and resources , and  the big companies have the logistics and they  will buy at lowest cost from Farmers and  export to other countries. This  will cause  food shortage in India,because big companies will  able to export the crops to more profitable buyers in other countries and the food prices will get more expensive in india. Modi is working for the  business tycoons, and big companies. The GTS is hurting the small shops, small factories, Modi needs to be removed from his throne.",

"No Laws enacted are flawless. Its application at ground levels manifests slowly some handicaps that need necessary corrections to the Laws to intended parties or beneficiaries of the Laws. Interestingly, those who are in protest, don't know what these Farm Laws stand for excepting MSP with wrong  ideas. Eventually, the Law Makers having theoretical knowledge do have little Hands-on on ground rule impacts that created a triangle of confusions between Government, Protestors and Farmers, the ultimate beneficiaries. So, it's better to repeal the Farm Laws that became an instrument to Protesters to make their Personal Selling only with allied political and standalone forces to disturb day-to-day normalcy in Public life, causing huge damage to Government Exchequer, regardless of any gains either. Furthermore, farmers are being duped by political parties due to lack of potent clarity of Laws as a tool to mislead Farmers with intent to oppose Central Government in coming Elections in some States.",

Solidarity to all farmers of the world,
"3. If a farmer agrees to make a contract with some organization for a certain price and say, after that the MSP was announced or say after the harvest, the MSP was higher than that of the contract price. Will the farmer get the MSP?",

Minimum support price is answer.,
"Khalistan is only solution for Punjab,",
"Actually yesterday in Punjab, 131.14 lakh tonnes of wheat has been procured, which is an all-time record. I think your video doesn't cover the entire situation precisely. There have been multiple talks between the farmers and the government. The government is ready to make changes to the law. But the farmers are adamant that they will only accept abolishing of the laws. The entire situation is very complex and hard to understand! Also when you are reporting some numbers, you should take the covid situation as well into account!",
we the people of india...are with the farmers.,

Farmers are our life line. They should be protected.,
"Punjab and Haryana which are leading the agitation suffer from a geo-political curse. In the years of public sector, government investment alluded them due to hostile borders. That affliction continues. This year Pakistan is importing 2.9 million metric tonnes of wheat from far of countries and so is Afghanistan. Export via road from Punjab is competitive due to low transport and handling costs. China has also sought Indian rice, to reduce its dependence on south east Asian countries. But we cannot deal with them for reasons of the national cause. ",

Though I'm pro BJP supporter...but this channel always have an unbiased opinion on every topic.,
Step 1: repeal of farm law ,
"Although BJP supported forced bifurcation of AP, people in residual AP elected NDA2 in 2014 hoping that it will give what was assured to them. Unfortunately, BJP not only denied what itself asked for the residual AP but also has been supporting the YCP govt. there, indicating BJP doesn't bother about Hindus in the South. Tirupathi is one reason for AP not getting Chennai (aka Chenna Patnam) when it separated from Madras state. As rightly said by Abhijit, Tirupathi has become a cash cow for the state govt. However, if Tirupathi was taken out of state control, then AP, which is already a budget deficit state due to the economically uneven division of the state, will become another Bihar.",
"This is the wheat sowing season, the potato planting season, the pulses planting season. Farmers protesting in Delhi, means their lands are going fallow in Punjab and Haryana.",

This government is against the farmer.We are with humans,
When Modi can buy two plains during a pandemic why Kisan can't have a comfort break. Try sleeping 107 days on the road. All kisan do go home from time to time for some break. What is wrong if they stayed in the hotel? They have not taken indian peoples money like modi,
"Kejriwal government is helping the farmers, it's good deed.",
Many people and farmers believe new farm laws provide incentive to private sector to get involve in farm sector. They can directly buy from farmer and hold inventor. People have fear that big corporate will exploit farmers as they always think for profit.  New farm laws not mentioned anywhere that it remove MSP but people believe that MSP and Govt Mandi will eventually dissolve in future due to competition from private sector. This will give monopoly to private sector in farm sector.,
"abp news should also ask our PM FM HM CM on 2 crore jobs, doubling of farmers income. petrol diesel lpg price loot, inflation, selling of PSU and banks, NPA, old pension policy, schools and hospitals etc. the public is interested in these core issues and will vote only on these basis.",

These reforms in farm bills are good for farmers,
Sir i can believe that kisaan from Punjab are influenced by foreign entities but is it possible for alll farmers from our motherland india and u know very well conditions of farmers in our motherland republic of india,
"As pr my thoughts, these protest could have been more bloody in near future. You shoot a protester they start riots then you bring army in which lots of sikh are present they would shoot on there own community people or go against government and this would have bring civil war within India and this would bring China to attack on India.Remember , Indra assassin could have been repeated after this and this would bring India on its knees forever.....a law was pulled back which was for farmers now they will understand the importance of it later as now they will be in misery again. A time to stop khalistan and anti India movement gave time to government also to make them rethink.Remember this law was never a security law in protection of nation.It was meant for farmers but behind the curtains the plan was fool on flourish to create massive riots during Punjab and UP election next year and Punjab shares border with Pakistan.....think of the repulsion",

I love the way he is begging now. One side His Ambani-adani papa will cut his pocket money other side farmer will cut his diet/ Roti pani Bichara modi,
Modi-Shah won't not commit mistakes like late Vajpayee ji. That's why he got re-elected in 2019 unlike the NDA in 2010. Statesmanship is not required all the time. It is more important to get Yogi re-elected in 2022 and also help Amarinder Singh to keep the Congress and AAP out of power in Punjab.,
Sir I think it's a great decision coz we are on a verge of a 2 front war with chaina pak so there shouldn't be any nuisance in the country if happens then it can play vital role against India also 2 steps back and then come with a bang is the best policy...,
"The Reporter did not say a word in favor of The Farmers Demands only Taliban Taliban Taliban Taliban if Modi is meeting Taliban's Representative  then was there any need to repeat Taliban Taliban, was he BJP'S REPRESENTATIVE or a Reporter? He was also being briefed by The Anchor sitting in the Studio. If Modi finds Taliban worthy for Talks then why this Reporter and Anchor were showing soooooooo hate for Taliban?. And zero sympathies for The Farmers. Please be Neutral Not Modi's Representative. Thanks.",
"Just see the pattern. Just watch the last few videos. Just after a break, this guy has joined godi media bandwagon",
stand and making farmers scape goat.,
Afganistani socail media where is but who giving this footages about afganistan afganistani Talibani,
Someone should brief them about the farm bill ie what it is all about. I am sure majority of them even not clear about the bill. Afterall if they want something to be changed they can raise their conern peacefully.,
If we consume organic then the seller prefer to buy crop from organic farmer. Then farmers grow organic food. Soil gets its fertiliy.,

Tab Tractor aur kisan note par tha,
"I am not supportive of every policies of the current Govt, but the new farm bills have far-reaching impact on the positive sense. I dont get why theres the fear of MSP going away. For the near future, atleast for the next 10-20 years, MSP isnt going anywhere. APMCs will be there, its just that a farmer living on the edge of a dist can now sell his perishable goods on the bordering dist than travelling all the way to his dists APMC mandi, and then not even getting a fair price for it. Also, these bills dont force the farmers to get in contract with corporates, they just keep that option open for them. Its the middlemen and the states that will take a hit(states get revenue out of APMCs). But if we dont liberalise the agri sector now, farmers will keep selling tomatoes at 2/kg and customers will get it at 30/kg. It defies logic that real farmers will protest against this. Its more the organisations that form the middle part of the supply chain, thats behind these protests I believe. Because if anyones half smart, hell know that these bills just gives poor farmers more options and opens up the sector. It doesnt harm any farmer.",
PM can call an emergency Parliamentary session to revoke/remove this bill but fooling Farmers He establish himself as a drama king or a fenku Farmers dont trust him any more you will see will start another issue like hindu muslim or Pakistan then Kashmir issue to fade And finish Kisan Andolan,

"Vaah moodi pehle khatm krta bill, tune y nhi ginaya , how many of our farmers were martyred",
Antinational farmers,
This video is a solid answer to people who are questioning the motive of farmers and why they are protesting in punjab and haryana only. They are literally thinking they are being funded by congress and pakistan.,
"the excess food bought by food corporation of india from farmers gets stored and when food corporation of india runs out of spaces to store it just gets dumped . Pvt players will have more resources to manage , store , these products , even export .One of the three laws will educate the farmers about new and modern techniques and different variety of crops  .",
Farmer: hey bro what are you planting?,
"Shekhar Ji... A bit early to box BJP as conceding (referring to your point 5 of your episode). Like I had written earlier, the Congress has committed grave blunders for decades and still managed to save its skin. Unlike Congress, BJP isn't shameless and coward to run away from tackling issues head-on. Wait and Watch ",

Prapogoda against India by BBC chanel,
Farmers are not getting the deserving rewards for their sweat & toil. Small farmers are very poor and unprivileged. Only processors of food & agro products and Wholeseller are making money with scoundrels & corrupt politicians.,
each indian farmer should receive $2000 stimulus cheques from their government,
"Minimum Support Price (MSP)  is like minimum wage operating in the world for laborers. If business houses deliberately finds that quality of produce is not good and Minimum Support Price is not fixed, farmers will be forced to sell compulsorily at lower price to big business houses. This will often lead to depression and frustration and on the part of small farmers who will be forced to commit suicide and sell their land. Big Business houses will accumulate huge produce of farmers through corruption and will make high profit.",
Genuine covering of farmer movement DIL se,
You sometimes have to lose a battle to win a war. Let's wait and watch instead of disparaging modiji.,

"Good political move before 2022 elections in punjab, U.P, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh (Major states of farmers protests against these 3bills). Reduction of oil prices also can make little impact.",
What can we do to stop these godi media?,
Some Farmers are unable to understand the vision of PM Modi. He always looks beyond 20 years and does things. It's unfortunate that farming sector won't be able to move forward.,

Ye law Rich farmer ke liye problematic ho sakta tha isiliye wo poor farmer ko bhadka ke aandolan me chale gaye..... ,
Do you think the government is so dumb to anger the farmers? ,
Sanghis are silent now..we can only pour tears for those poor farmers died . Kneeling infront of the protest is pms relief package for this channel. Cowsamy really mocking at the common sense of our people.,

Lage hath modi ji #railway_groupd_exam_date bhi bta dete to thik rahta ,
The govt had pushed the farmers patience beyond bearable limits! They took them for granted and turned a blind eye for 60 days. The govt is casual in its approach to the problem!,
Look at our country...if ur a farmer's child they will not allowed u to follow their foot step.,

"So this coward ran away. Today I watched young Afgani men protesting in Germany, if they cared they would have gone back and fought, coward men.

"Yes we have seen discussion for previous 70 years, amazing reforms were done and farmers were so beautifully treated.",
3. Why the new bill does not tax the private players - but only the APMC licensed buyers? Is this not a big problem of the bill to force the farmers to sell to private players and make APMC irrelevant in long run?,
Manipulate video.. Your supporting Bjp,
Media is behaving as if farmers don't have minds of their own... They are definitely not misleaded,
I wont be agree as reliance is such a big company it can easily offer more money to the farmers for years (like how it did in the telecom industry) and that way the APMC will just die out.,
"Well, Punjabis loved kissing the BJP feet. You reap what you sow. Hopefully this will be a lesson to them in the next election.",
Congrats farmers ,
Good start for would farmers.,
Stand with farmers ,
"Whatever happened was not right, but completely blaming farmer and calling them anti-national is ALSO NOT  right This is the same DL Police which attacked STUDENTS sitting in JMI Library. Everyone here knows how the bill was made, passed. Mending things/ situations according to their comfort and sensibility",
I respect farmers but,
I also support farmers but always feels weird when nobody talks about the labourers here in punjab a farmer earns around one lakh from 2 hectares of land annually and the labourers who plant paddy get 300 per day ,
Thanks haryana for support kissan union,
Unfaithful bjp govt are not even spared farmers where is our country heading too people open ur eyes and elect the good leaders we don't want this mischief every other day,
Government ko kissan ki baat smajhni chahiye. We are farmer. Protect farmer.,
Start of new suicide era for small farmers with force of mandi,
The issue is there needs to be a transition strategy and some assurances for the farmer. Farming is anyways so unpredictable that more uncertainty just creates fear and mistrust. ,
Me with the farmers of my country,
Really happy for farmers ,
"One thing you forgot to mentioned,  according to the first law, in case of dispute in the contact, farmers can't go any if the Courts for a resolution. They can only bring the issue till DC. Imagine farmers taking a case against Reliance or Birla to DC for resolution. Who will win? Exploitation could be at mass level.",
1) Jab police farmers ko tractor parade ki ijazat di thi to limitations rakhne chahiye the tractors or logo ki,
3) Farmers can be easily exploited by the companies because there is no mechanism of fixation of prices in price assurance bill.,
What created doubts most to the farmers is how big big silos has been built by private organisations before laws came into existence.,
Finally they succeed..A big salute and thanks to all farmers who struggled alot to repeal farmer laws..this protest end up after one year..largest nd longest protest in human historyRIP all those farmers who lost their lives while struggling against these laws....i wish indian government will understand people to make their life better instead of ruining their life,
These Laws would have bought Loss to small scale Farmers who are in majority in long term!! So may be it's withdrawal will benefit small scale farmers! The bill will only benefit large scale farmers,
"After 1 year passed of the bill, now I clearly understood the bill, I'm a farmers son, now I'm gonna explain this to more...",
"Totally agree with Sandeep Ji that this is a political decision to make Capt. Amarinder Singh Ji's positions strong in upcoming Punjab assembly elections but also totally agree with PM Modi Ji reason behind this of national interest or national security as in making this decision would have several benefits - 1. So called Kisan Andolan and Andolanjeevis will become weaker and for what cause they would continue their andolan as thought they might not end it but reasoning behind it has already been finished now by PM big decision, 2. Opposition went flat on the floor, they are thinking of new toolkits now, 3. Amarinder chances to win Punjab election become stronger and now he can openly collide with BJP, 4. Capt Ji might not have favourable image in many people but one thing could say about him is that he is a nationalist and winning a border state like Punjab and having a CM with support of the center party would surely increase more security guards to the state and the BHARAT, 5. Big questions - what will happen to small 95% farmers for whose benefits these laws were made and another questions is now laws will be made or changed by street power ? Well, it's back to status quo of before the laws were made that was there for all this time from so called freedom but this decision has been made for long term benefits today laws are getting repealed tomorrow stronger laws will be made with more support, one must not forget that the person who started this andolan was Capt Ji and it's mainly from Punjab state so now he's in your side would change lots of things in near future, about second question about street power to make or change laws well 95% people can do that too to not support this decision of PM Modi to repeal the laws, who's stopping majority nationalist public of this country to come on streets, if they are really angry they can come on the streets.",
"Manjit Singh, I challenge you to wear a khakhi Nikkar and enter in the jurisdiction of Punjab if you support RSS. You are a black spot on punjabi's and Punjab. I just want to remind and ask you to understand these words 'Chamcha', 'Gaddar' and then you will never support BJP.",
If govt has passed this bill to give benefits to the farmers. If in case in future somewhere if farmers incurred some loss due to this bills then govt duty to change as per the need. It is not compulsory that only bjp has to do it. It has to be done by the party who is in power. All time opposing is not the solution it will always keep us backward.,
"4. not being consulted : if government really start consulting everyone before passing any bill, no bill can be passed. almost all the bills which were passed in bjp government were challenged on streets by some people. but the common people liked what bjp was doing. and for the same reason, the opposition is getting defeated. plus, the governments don't always need to take permission to bring reforms. because almost all reforms have been opposed in past. this would not be a new thing. ",
Mobocracy won . Modi had to save india from breaking away from the hands of khalistani supporters . Shame on indian media for not supporting,
"As a farmer's son, i support the bill. They have to lift the restrictions on export of rice and sugar. Especially sugar cane industry is dying in my area due to lack of   msp. So many people are commenting without having knowledge on agriculture",
Defeat of real farmers....,
I support farmers ,
"Only Sardar and Punjabi farners are effected? Really? Time for all ""liberal"" media to open their eyes. You may want a little fame but not at the cost of democracy.",
Amrinder offertunist jai kissan farmers never forget atrocities muted on farmers abuses forcing loose police goons etc dont forget bros,
If the farmers can utilise the good factors properly it is v.fine.   but my question is why the govt. Got it passed without having proper session of thorough discussion in parliament? .,
Like the dispute between farmers and corporates will not go to court but will be settled by an Administrative officer. This can lead to favoured judgment as the law will not take ita due course,
How do you justify blockade of roads in a Countrys capital ? Are farmers a privileged class in our country? Why they should get everything free but they sell for a price?,
3. Both farmers and mandis have to show accounts of their transactions.,
If current system is very good then why farmers are doing suicide. Don't make your mockery. Please let implement these bill. I will be beneficial.,
Even our media is fucked up. Putting pressure on farmers by making nonsense Alligaitons,
BBC will always support their masters who give tham advertisement .... Foreign Companys .....Sold media ..we understand everything,
They all are not farmers ...I know how behaves farmers ..I am also farmer. I support that laws..why the Panjab people  only rejecting that laws,
Few years back I started growing organic vegetables on farm to home basis where we could eliminate 6 middlemen and got remunative prices. My father was one the biggest agriculturist but I could not get best quality wheat and rice because I live in West Bengal.,
The food I have today. And the tears from the farmers made me cry...  Those who eat food support our farmers.or else all will suffer including b. Jp. And. R. Ss.,
Today on 19 November we defeated the modi government. No farmers no food ,
"Bro, if Govt. wants to get out of Agri businesses, then what's the guarantee that the farmers will get protected from or out of these  bills..!!",
Thankyou VICE (from a farmer),
The laws  were good for the farmers. It's sad that they had to be repealed in the larger interest of the nation.,
Hmm to be honest its a win of politicians  whether they r from bjp or congress etc  loss of farmers not a win of farmers,
"Arnab please question the preposterous judgement of our modi ji. How can he do this! These farmers are terrorist, he is negotiating with terrorist. He should must encourage encounters of these people.! Arnab please Arbab, please do this!",

Vice you didn't show the pics of  'farmers' attacking police with sword??????,
Why didn't the government of Haryana and Punjab abolished MSP decades back like all other states? Who is to be blamed? Congress is playing dirty politics.,

Black day for real farmers,

"People who are bragging about peace and protest, they do not know that the farmers were on roads for more than 4-5 months.

Being a sheep is easy but fighting for your rights is not for everyone' caliber. Kissan Majdoor Ekta zindabad ",
Imo indian govt should rectify these laws in some way to restrict pvt companies so that they can't exploit farmers. There are too many loopholes that can exploit the small scale farmers & farm land will eventually fall in the hand of those companies.,
We stand with our farmers ,
Bjp is ruling india... We can't expect kindness from shoe lickers...        Farmers are ruling the world.... Support you guys..... Jay kisan,

Why the police against the farmers they are  gods for us but bjp treating them as waste,

Karan bhai Such a proud moment for me that your not With Godi Media .. Seriously Thanks For this Reality Shown To Us,
"All relevant points raised...One thing sir, many so called agriculture experts are saying that only 6 percent farmers gets the benefits of MSP...Then why they are fighting for already failed system...Or only for 6 percent farmers?...I have interviewed most of them and that time they all were against apmc...I thank you once again for bringing clarity to the issue...",
Abolishing APMC in bihar has had very bad effect. Farm laws are likely to create monopoly of corporates. States should create a cooperative mechanism. Bottom line is if Farmers do not want the law then why force a law. Surely someone else is benefited. If government wants to do away with MSP then government should  state that clearly.,
"In MS,the farmers r enjoying the MSP & free Mandi's alongwith contract farming since2006-2007. U must be aware that western Maharashtra is having horticultural crops where all company's participate in Veg, grape,Pomo& Mango...People enjoy the competition & fetch the good prices. It's pure political game...Rice& wheat, Punjab & haryana farmers fetch the highest MSP benefit.",
So so happy for the farmers,
Misleading Godi media lapdog. This one.,
"Back in February, PFJ video was out where one of their leaders openly challenged Indian government by saying their demand for repealing the farm laws is just the beginning, wait and watch.. Our defense ministry doesnt need coaching from Abhijit to let them know to become more vigilant and take notice of PFJ turning into a huge terror force. Be rest assured, none of the intelligence on PFJ has gone unaddressed as Abhijit keep claiming as the government do realize that PFJ is becoming a potential threat to the nation. ",
I wish Indian media was stating facts like Vox instead of the being the hypocritic bought out companies they are.,

Thank you for all care and responsibilities you have been handling since 2014..",
I come from an India where comedians talk reality and politicians do comedy.,
"Hopefully, all the states except Punjab,  will bring in the same farm bills which are supported by 80% of the rest of the Indian 'real farmers' . Reassess the MSP for Rice and Wheat food grains which are over supplied and affecting water supply. Modi should come clean for the real reason for repealing the farm laws to regain people's trust  and the people have a right to know.",
These people are dalars and agents not farmers..,
We people must support farmers if we love our own mother - father - children.,
And then this policy was launched without first consulting the stake holders ( farmers and their leaders ) where while taking their fears or apprehensions in mind a better law could have been incorporated with a firm long term plan in place where crop diversification would be put in place and a subsidy provided by the centre for a fixed number of years while the transition is in place.,

"2. In the 2nd bill, As explained in the clip, there will be no tax if a farmer sells out the Mandi or APMC but one have to pay tax if it is sell inside a Mandi. So who wants to pay extra tax when I can sell legally without paying tax outside?? Slowly few years down the line there will be no business transaction in an Mandi n will have to close down. State government lose its tax revenue, no government or FCI purchase on MSP or minimum support price. No wonder if the subsidies food items the government provide to hunger poor people in a fair price shop will close down or not. ",

I don't understand your discussion 100pct but as a common man  why should I favour BJP where this party increase the fuel price increased unethical ly and the comon man suffering. Vel vel vetrivel. This is tamil God murugans weapon. Happy everybody is praising.,
"Hi, please tell me if I am wrong here. I am in support of these farm bills that have been brought by the government and I don't think that we need such legal MSPs or whatever. Because if party A is in favour of strict MSP and party B is not in favour of MSP, then corporates will support party B in elections. You can't avoid the interference. Instead, the problem can be solved by incentivising startups. Because if you have 10 companies like bigBasket then you will have competition. A company that offers better price to farmers and low price to consumers, actually grows. A new businessman can reduce monopoly of the old businessman. Competition in companies, is crucial for benefit of mankind.",

"This bill actually helps farmers. This example should serve western folks well in understanding why reform is so difficult in developing countries.

The old system is why u have Sikhs picking tomatoes in Italy. Reform is hard on some vested interests and they will cry bloody murder no matter what. For countries like India to improve,  which is a Kafkaesque socialist nightmare, reform is an absolute must.",

You are great sirji ...sahi or galat ki pahchan h sir aapko...I m always with farmers,
Repealing farm laws is the very fear which is sensed by political parties in North India.,
Interesting there was no discussion with farmer. Not even tikat consulted before taking step. Simple made tikat irrelevant in one day,
"Also the new farm laws allows farmers to form aggregates (basically multiple farmers or multiple villages can enter into a contract with one coporate/private contractor as one single, giant entity). This alone should nullify any scope of coporations dominating the farmers.",
"Achha kiye apne ye laws retract karliye,  aagar laws galat the to wapas leke apke jit huyi aur agar achhe the to bhi apki hi jit huye, apne kaushish to ki. Let the farmers take their decision of their own  future. Haar jit ka feishla unko khudko karne de",

SG think its perfectly legitimate that crooks can demolish his office where many of them work just for a word politics. Now replace SG with farmers or any working class. SHAME and self destructive,
Even Indian media is prejudice against farmers,
It is much associated with the upcoming election in Punjab and U.P  if government don't repeal this farm bill there would be chance of securing majority of votes by the government so to secure vote banks i think the government decided to do this,

Delhi police tried best to bring down the flag hoidted by Farmers but Failed miserably ,
The unfortunate thing about we Indians is we become judgmental very soon. This bill which was introduced through ordinance one year ago has already gone through what it has to in this 1 year. Just as the way demonetation has done enough damage to those vested power so also this bill. People who can see beyond the seen only can understand our PM. A person whose only aim is to see the prosperity of this nation will never ever let his people down.,
We r with farmer,
My question is why only punjabi farmers are protesting ?,
I with farmer  i with jawan or kissan,
"That's what democracy means. That's how a protest should work. Their honesty, their unity, that's indian farmers. Rab is there!",
"Is the objectionable three farm laws brought by Modi government worth their merit, with the continuing opposition by the Indian farmers? And the happenings?",

"In the present situation, middle men are eating most of the money of farmers since dey buy agriculture goods for very low price and sell it fa higher. But according to new bill.

Even in the covid condition agriculture GDP is +4.6 where as other sectors are in negatives Giving better pricing for the farmers produce would bring miracles in agriculture.There are pros n cons... Whatever but farmers have to b benifitted.",

Huge Support from Pakistan ,
"There isnt much in they way of an arguement for why these laws where brought into existence in the first place. Dont really expect VOX to be objective when their is a left wing narrative to peddle. If the farmers get better price they should be allowed, but they shouldnt expect the taxpayers to fund their inefficienct methods. The govt is no better, but an unregulated market is necessary to bring in much needed capital. As to your arguement on bihar, simpluly deregulating the the market is not enough, there isnt much in the way of capital to go into bihar wherw the political setup is significantly more dysfunctional for any sane investor to get involved in. The arguement vox peddles is the same reason why India remained where she was for 40+ years. Vox is a product of post 2008 US, their fundamentally ideology is distrust towards market regulated or otherwise, nothing they've said so far has shown otherwise. Considering how  era defining these farm laws are and the effect it will have in India , a bit more objectivity and analysis of the arguements behind the govts rationale wpupd have been appreciated even if that's too much of an ask.",

This situation is not being clearly represented on the media. The agriculture laws are actually helpful to farmers from poorer parts of the country,
Ma'am with all due respect! I think a farmer can sell his produce outside the mandi or in any other state. Correct me if I'm wrong.,
They are not farmers .. they are truly inspired political people's.. so government should ignore not to listen these fellow,
"If only 6 percent farmers may affect then why millions of people opposing these bills. I think government is playing logically to start giving benefits to large organizations by removing tax on sale to outside party. Furthermore, if government were really taking all the stakeholders on board then why their demands didn't considered..",
"Sir, with all due respect, in relation to your comment on how the farmers could only sell their crops to one mandi is rather incorrect. There is no such restriction in the first place, the farmers could do this even before the act was passed. The only restriction was to the middlemen, they could only buy the crops in one mandi. The farmers had the choice to sell their crops in other states. And even if farmers do choose to sell their crops in other states, it only puts more burden on them in terms of storage and transportation and with 85% of farmers in India being small landholdings, they would not want to have such additional burden of cost and along with a risk that even the price in the other state is not favourable. These acts may appeal us on paper, but in practice, it doesn't work! Yes, there needs to be reform and investment in the agricultural industry but that needs to be from the government. These big private companies only run on profit, they will not benefit the farmer. With all due respect, but I just found that your comments were too far removed from reality in the farming sector. Speak to a farmer from Punjab, Haryana, UP, MP, Maharastra, Tamil Nadu and other regions. Listen to what they actually have to say, these farmers are educated, they know the reality of the laws. We, as consumers, will also suffer when such large companies start to hoard the produce with the amendment to the essential commodities act. Inflation would be the ultimate result. All the people who are protesting are not such narrow-minded, they have read the laws and know the actual effect of them. The power of the people is behind the unions. The politicians are only scared of their vote, farmers account for such a large proportion that they can't just ignore them. Farmers are on the streets asking for their rights, the least we can do is support them and understand their position. Such an analysis is too removed from reality.",
Mass civilization  in India is  very  poor.  Though Farmers  Bill  is inevitable  for our  country . only  5% population  those in advantage  group in society  opposed the  Bill. It is temporary  withdrawal.  But,
real farmer lost today,

Please go to him if you have any problem he will find solutions now Indian entire political agenda changed by some greedy people who love Sonia never want to be Gandhi  but people of India 80% population support BJP& RSS all hater of you still want to join us you will go through strong  it is my appeal that no true Indian is freed until Sonia fake Gandhi go back Italy or until her death,
When is wion going to cover the farmer protest. We should care more about India then afghastian,
"1. Since the MSP does not apply outside the Mandi, the implicit assumption is that the farmer will come to the Mandi and get that price if private markets dont bear that price.  But, since in the new set up most likely initially non-mandi markets will drive most of the business out of the Mandi, it will lead to the collapse of the Mandi system entirely. This will eventually lead to its demise. At this point the MSP will be gone!  Now you have a free market without a bottom MSP price.  And as we know from the west agriculture prices dont increase with market pressures.  That is the issue. Make MSP pan India outside of Mandi. ",
Farmer are the soul of India,

The FAKES and bots should learn there are still sane and patriotic people left in this country. After long time I now feel a lot relaxed.

1) this will reduce sucide of farmers,
Full supoort to farmers,
Its all about angles. This applies to we Indians. We are seeped in mental slavery and blind aping people whom we think are superior and masters. True to break the shackles of mental slavery is more difficult so we Indian should strive hard to break this shackle and Indianize everything top to bottom. If continue to follow our masters we would always be tailing them and remain back benchers. Wearing Indian dresses adopting indian way of life and biases is kind of social taboo.......,

Lets not loose the point inconvenience is created by failure of government by not handling situation well. They could have resolved this issues when farmers protest were limited to states. Government and media cant always blame citizens for everything. Its high time we make government accountable.,
NOW OTHER FARMERS WILL COME PUT AND PROTEST AGAINST THIS MOVE. MY GOD INDIA NEED SOME SERIOUS HELP.,
"When farmers were protesting peacefully for nearly two three months everybody ignored them but when they decided to go to Delhi trucks,buses and cement barricades were put in the middle of the road ",
I hope your thoughts on why farmers were protesting is changed after looking what happened since you made this video. They were protesting to get this bills repel. The farmers those who were protesting are those 6% farmers who gets the benefits of msp. It would be great if you had also covered why only few sections of farmers were protesting.,
"We support kisan andolan, they are fighting for their right.",
Feeling a lot of Proud for our Farmers..,
Modi govt should pay all damages because they never consult farmers before imposing law,
"Thank you for a very well explained video, although not everything is wrong in the farm bill, but I see the loopholes, but that is prevalent in any kind of process. Cant government and farmers come to the middle way where farmers' interests are also be maintained, and the bill can also be passed?",
"Stop using misleading titles , no stones were used by farmers",
  next PM election  BJP     ?,
"Which Public is not made aware of,. For Modis Government there is more to lose if Farmers Protests continue than finishing them.",
He said give 2 options about of 101 solutions. Salute this Farmer.,
It is anti BJP andolan. Majority of the farmers are not with this Tikait drama. ,
"People are saying support farmers , but only farmers from few region benefit from the existing  APMC model. Its not possible for government to give MSP on all crops an hence only Wheat and rice growers that too from Punjab, Haryana ,West UP profited from this. The new farm bill is to break this monopoly , I don't think the two states will make government to repeal the new Bill. They will most probably give a temporary assurance and in future also will buy wheat and rice on MSP but just for the time being until this sentiment dies out. Eventually in a different form or so the new bill will take effect. Considering the farmers suicide in western and southern parts of India due to the failure of APMC model , I will weigh in favor of new farm bills.",
"Just wondering what this ""intellectual guy"" gonna say after 26jan 2021 event . Btw take note guys his thumbnail says : ""abb farmers khalisthani?""  as of 26th January 10:45pm.",

"My kudos to all farmers of India for standing strong against evildoers, creeps who want to lure",
*there are very small to no protests and rallies in other part of India besides Punjab and Hariyana,
I will rather accept corporations rule the farmlands. This is totally unacceptable. Most of them don't even read the bill properly. This happens all the time in my country India. Most of the protestors doesn't even know why they're protesting at first place.,
"Just two minutes ago he himself told that MSP is a failure, and now he is saying that it is negative for farmers to not get the benefit of MSP",
Bhai you never talked why 90%farmers started using this bill ? Why problem is with few farmers of Punjab n haryana ?,
FARMERS protest can further rise the covid infections. Not playing politics but general concern.,
I think in the  name of farmers opposition party is creating so much of issues n voilence..farmers are not so wild animals,

AAP member effectively made Shaheen Bagh and supporting this. Why you are showing idiot Congress leader from Karnataka who has lost his original constituency.,
"Those who understand cold chain knows that this is the only future. It's similar to the way that right now air India is sold back to Tata, Indian govt. meddled in many things during 20th century which they shouldn't have meddled with this is one of those thing, APMC just did one thing that's to improve life of few farmers from a specific state..

These are not farmers these are dacoits,
Our great farmers..don't you dare to bother them..,
"I dont think the intermediaries would go alltogether as the companies would still require to approach farmers for contract farming.  The companies would probably require services of these intermediaries to handle this.  Agreed, the extent of the cartelization or monopolization would go away though.",
"So basically, MSP on Grains is required in Bihar, UP and such states, which is being done in Punjab at this point of time with the way of APMC. And APMC is required to incentivize Farmers to produce Oil Seeds and other such crops that are not in surplus. If you can feel the pulse(nabz) of Punjab, we don't want to produce so much rice, because it is bad for our ecosystem, we want to produce Maze and Sunflower and such things. Coming to MSP, it may have come as an incentive to produce more, but the essence is security. If there isn't one for Maze and such crops, farmers won't grow such crops. What's required is restructuring of 1. MSP 2. Procurement of other crops than just grains 3. Cold storage houses allowing farmers and governments to store their produce and procurement respectively. Which then can be sold to the companies. FCI can sell to companies to gain profits year by year with the procurement that is surplus. FCI & Companies can be allowed to pick at Farms and other places, but the transaction must be made in APMC mandis and that should be registered. So that farmers have a record that is under the protection of a mandi, if such payments are not made in time, Farmers should be allowed to go to court.",
Bjp govt has sold most of India govt owned facilities,
persons who are against this protest do not know the results of this law..when India is on the verge of destruction in terms of everything then these people will awake..one min.silence for these people...,

All anti national s in the name of farmer are going back. I am also a farmer. These laws are benefit to real farmers,
"1) The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce Ordinance just says that all types of agri trade will be allowed (even outside state regulated) APMC mandis. So, now anyone can trade within the State or across the state all over India and it can be physical trade or online trade. And the most important thing is if Vivek opens a mandi/market for trade of agri commodities (ether i am procuring from farmers and selling it to retailers in my physical mandi or I opened an online portal just like amazon) anywhere in India then NO STATE CAN PUT ANY KIND OF TAX/CHARGES ON AGRI TRANSACTIONS. ",

"Excuse me, but this is how democracy works. Indian democracy is healthy and working,  that is the point here. Modi is not an autocratic strongman like western liberal media want to portray him; he is a democratically elected leader, that needs to surrender to the power of people ultimately. Ridiculous examples related to vajpayee and manmohan lost badly, not bravery, poor judgement since power in democracy lies with the people..",
'Cut your loses and retreat'. But to be in that situation in the first place passing anti indian population laws to please your RSS BJP Hindi vote bank is reckless and arrogant and only protrays a Hindu fundamentalist government.,

Protest for remaining 94% farmers who are poor and were happy with these farm laws ? Modi supporters are praising him to,
"How could farmers enter red fort so easily? Why didn't police be placed in high no. to stop such incident when everyone knew they were approaching red fort?

"The tragedy of a democracy is that any political party can play games with the sentiments of the electorate and fiddle lies for narrow political wins. Although democracy is still the best form of governance, maybe we need changes to the structure now. I imagine sometimes, how India would have done if had followed a model like South Korea or Singapore. We talk about Pakistan because they had failed miserably but South Korea and Singapore had pretty authoritarian rulers",

There can be flaws in the current bill that the government has passed but I see this as a very necessary and effective step Indian government has taken and in the long run will help farmers to earn way more money then they are earning right now...,

Regression is marketed as Reform by Shekhar Gupta. Numbers are manipulated to show that farm laws are beneficial to Farmers,
"Modifications could work. However, the complete repel of laws gives encouragement to some sections of the society whose main motto is to just oppose the government. It's useless for the sections to check whether the policies will help the poors, the downtrodden and how   can  we forget about the environmental concerns and security of India!",

The rest of india farmers are okay with the new law ,
"Many of western countries trying to sell their excessive food corps to india and other asian countries through WTO so they have pressured india to abolish subsidies farming practices like msp..and if the farmers of india will not get any subsidies,there will be a automatic choice to them that they go through the trap of capitalist and it will help the farmers of USA and Europe to invest in the indian agriculture in form of contract farming...but in the result of that after few decades definitely we become the export oriented countries in different cash corps but it will grab our lands of food corps..and then we have to depend on the USA or European countries for our foods.. definitely food prices will hike..some time we may starve as exporting countries may betray..so in my knowledge it will be a massacre..we dont lose our self dependency in food corps and dont abolish the msp like system as it is the backbone of our country...",
