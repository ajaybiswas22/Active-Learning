"Why modi or amitshah didn't visit the farmer protest site all these 9 months ? And promise the farmers of MSP.agriculture is a state subject,but bill was passed with out consulting states and by cancelling question hour in parliament when the bill was passed.completely unconstitutional.",1
"Why are the farmers supporting  middlemen? Both the families of Amrinder Sing, CM ,and Badal, are loosers in the new system.  So why landless and small farmers  protesting? A few years back, the middlemen supported by Forward Block party in WB, stalled the establishment of Metro  Cash and Carry in Kolkata,  fearing that small farmers would be held economic hostage by the company. But after 10 to 12 years, you can see nothing of that sort happened  and the farmers are happy with the deals. Those middlemen  sought other forms of employment.",0
khalistan is their ultimate solution.......they are waste their time in these demonstrations,0
take modi to these protests ,1
SUPPORT TO THE FARMERS !!,1
Punjab and Haryana want all their rice and wheat to be bought by FCI leaving all other farmers from rest of India in the mercy of local traders.,0
The other farmers who support these laws should try to support these laws by counter protests.,1
Farmers still do sell their crop outside mandis.,1
And now farmers will enjoy lavishing life & economy of farmers will rise 10 times which were never happened before. Khusia manao. . Congress bale hi farmers ke bare me sochte the. Unke jamane ka hi farmers ka condition thik tha.,0
We support this Bill if one state not get advantage from it doesn't means to let other poor farmers also suffer ,0
Punjab farmer lobby is different!!,0
"Farmers' protest started with great intent, and to be honest they have got a lot improved through discussions with the government. The MSP is guaranteed along with other demands that were put in as a check to not let corporate overlords take advantage of vulnerable farmers. ",1

"Modi has shown weakness in the blockage incidents, in the insult f national flag and in the U turn. With the Hindus being a bit more aware, religion has become a factor in Indian polity. But with them having no other Hindu party BJP milks their emotion but doesn't care about them as they will have to vote the BJP. Thus Bengal boils, sadhus are killed. ",1

Farmers should become more competitive,0
"So Punjab and Haryana Farmers keep producing these resource intensive crops like paddy, sugarcane.. Sell all to government. Government exchequer bears all brunt.. Ultimately the common tax payers. With private sector money flow, technical expertise and demand they can start growing high yield crops, benefit themselves and the companies. So basically Haryana and Punjab farmers want things to stay as it is as they fill up the FCI quota. Hmmpf!",0
Farmers are right!!!!!,1
To support Muslims,1
I support the farmers!!!!!! May their protest be successful.,1
Farmers have already filed case in Supreme Court challenging legality of these laws.  A good multi pronged action.  They should also ask their BJP MPs and MLAs whether they stand with farmers or against.  They should boycott all of those who are favouring the farm laws and denigrating the farmers movement.  They should protest in front of BJP offices in each of the districts asking the party to take a stand against the bills,1

The farmers were asking for their rights. Why were they hit so badly ? ,1
Modi is effected by 2002 syndrome. Though he was not atall involve tons of muks was thrown to him. Now he is himself starts feeling gulti of the crime which was not done by him. So he is not taking any strict actions. He may be want to spend the remaining life peacefully.,0

Farmers from any where in India are very peaceful people this violence was deliberately done by ruling party to break morale of farmers,1
Farmers protesters are creating more trouble. The murder was not done a single person. Group was involved. But now Farmers protesters are in trouble and Surrendered one suspect. But entire Farmers Group are nit peaceful protesters.  Rakash takit are causing great pain to all road users in public. Rakesh takit if you have guts and talent.  Contest elections and repeal the farms laws. But instead blackmail or threatened has caused the Farmers protest as a mockery and hidden agenda of Congress and TMC or Owassi.,0
Modi lose farmers win,1
Farmers all over india to be helped by govt.,1
"the farmers protesting the farm bill are not only sikhs. In Punjab and Haryana  there are Hindu farmers , Sikh farmers Muslim farmers.  in Punjab and Haryana, the farmers are not only from from jatt caste or sikhs, there are also pundits, Brahmins , and dogar farmers in Punjab.  Farmers feed the nation.Big companies like Tata, Birla, Reliance, Ebany,  Adnany , these big companies are  controlling Modi. These bills are designed to   make  each farmer compete against each other so that big companies can buy crops at lowest rate, because farmer will have no option to sell to another buyer due to lack of logistics and lack  resources , and  the big companies have the logistics and they  will buy at lowest cost from Farmers and  export to other countries. This  will cause  food shortage in India,because big companies will  able to export the crops to more profitable buyers in other countries and the food prices will get more expensive in india. Modi is working for the  business tycoons, and big companies. The GST is hurting the small shops, small factories, Modi needs to be removed from his throne.",1

"Do farmers really watch parliamentary debates? Does any meaningful discussion ever happen during parliamentary debates? The opposition wouldn't have agreed even if there were lengthy discussions. In the end, it would have come to a vote in parliament on the laws and the majority would get their way. Also by your logic, government should consult everyone on income tax, defence related laws. This way we'll never be able to pass any law. One should either believe in democracy or not. Once a government is chosen by majority, one must allow them to operate rather than blockading cities.",0
