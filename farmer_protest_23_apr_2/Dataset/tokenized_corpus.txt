3 essential commodity act if corporate sector stock more stock at time there be shortage of product in market then price will increase rapidly government say they will not interfere until the price of product increase by 2 time or 1 5 time please clear this doubt

minimum support price and maximum retail price change every year before farm start if supply increase and demand be not there then minimum support price and if supply decrease and demand more than maximum retail price this be applicable for all farmer item plus supply increase then do export and never do important and instead of important give high price to farmer
actually farmer also do not know
refusal and denial of the exist poverty among the farmer and poverty in general have become the norm for pm modi we know that the report lack conformity and reform improvement and amendment of what be wrong be ignore thus corrupt and the people of india experience unsatisfactory result
i be unable to understand why the policymakers and the bureaucrat involve in these bill have still not think about the impact on farmer it be go to create in long term and force this law in favour of capitalist

indian new chanal sell by modi government
when farmer will be squeeze between high cost of cultivation and low price ca not they sell their product to apmc mandi where they will get minimum support price so how can you say that government want to get out of the agri business
i dont think that dear modiji or any senior bjp be involve a party head know anything he be always ignorant about important thing
the new farm law will not only affect the farmer but also u the citizen who rely on the farm product directly or indirectly change to uplift the agriculture and farmer lifestyle be definitely require but it must also involve understand their issue at the ground level and work on the solution around it a small inconvenience in our life to uplift our farmer live be the least we could take
there be apmc act mandi be in punjab and haryana give by then central govt after the agitation of sir chotu ram kisan leader of undivided punjab
the govt can launch a scheme where farmer get a fair price for their land this will also be useful in bail out farmer then the govt give the farmer a fix salary for produce crop this way farmer be ensure a fixed income even if the harvest be not good give them financial security the govt get all these crop and then sell these to the trader at the govt price this way the govt can control market price both the farmer and the consumer benefit from this
with this law monopoly will increase actually it look good by read and it can exploit the farmer and environment by business man

this be the datta samant moment for indian farmer if they do not stop at the right time they should just look at what happen with famous textile mill of mumbai you can not have msp that be declare by the govt on all agricultural produce the market will fall and then trader will resort to cheap import consumer will also adjust it be the farmer that will have no where to go i fear for the farmer hope good sense prevail and the protest be at least call off now
you do not mention about minimum support price that give protection to the farmer and the help extend by the government in case private player try to cheat
not happy at all it be for real farmer but protester be not farmer they be political motivate middle man
i be stand with farmer and it their victory against dictatorship
we all stand with modiji bjp
new farm bill be more vulnerable to monopoly atleast when you know that there be no limit on hoard when there should be also like you say that the product be perishable in nature hoard only help them exploit the producer farmer even more for eg a product with msp of r 100 for once be purchase at r 120 result in maximum produce and sale let be say twice the actual demand the remain produce can be hoard and in the next season trader buyer can either refuse to buy new product or ask them farmer to sell the same product at a half price because of their perishable nature farmer would not have other option but to agree also the potential player will be very limited and an open market say be just a gimmick because in the begin the product will be purchase at lucrative price which have never be offer earlier at price which can not be pay by others even with take huge loss on the account of buyer to kill a potential competition like it happen in the case of jio even idea and vodafone fail to survive which other buyer can take loss as much a adani in the agriculture sector anyone and then when the competition be dead there be no msp to protect farmer be interest mandis will close down eventually a they d largely remain non functional because of a good deal from the pvt buyer in the beginning like it happen with bsnl we already have see such market disaster in the recent time do not we learn anything from it how can farmer survive an exploitative monopoly which even idea and vodafone could not survive apmcs be atleast in the interest of farmer new farm bill actually make the producer farmer most vulnerable in apmcs trader license be give to those who be close to state govts and the govts keep change thus keep the cycle run open market with no law for msp unlimited hoarding and with giant like adani it be just delusional to expect a fair business take place even in an open market this monopoly be worse by a 100 mile when compare to the conventional system of apmcs
wah agree with my farmer humare liye covid hai and police k liy nahi hai

protest farmer do not attack pass car or lynch people
by any which way be it possible for government to take back such law although i certainly believe that these be for the farmer benifit
our family have be a farmer throughout generation for the last decade our production be profitable enough but a time go by the price of rice in the philippine still stagnant and steady much bad reduce due to high competition from import rice many of the farmer in our community be in debt because of high cost of fertilizer obsolete technique calamity and rice tariff law
our pm sahib have no time to meet the kisans personally then because that be what the farmer brother be ask for but now on medium platform on guru purab announce that 3 law would be repeal would not change the hatred the bjp govt gather in this past year

i do not support these 3 farm law and also i do not support this repeal what gov have to do be make some change in this farm law a what some farmer demand like msp and all

do you want to know why be farmer protest
one nation one market exist today too this bill be a sham to ensure corporates can bully farmer and buy fruit and vegetable at heavily discount rate
instead of name name who kill farmer who kill bjp worker let u all wait for judiciary to give their verdict
abolish apmc in bihar have have very bad effect farm law be likely to create monopoly of corporates state should create a cooperative mechanism bottom line be if farmer do not want the law then why force a law surely someone else be benefit if government want to do away with msp then government should state that clearly

all drama ask one of them to explain the bill and their mouth will shut it be just modi hatred in play
put the culprit behind bar jai farmer
besides northen region like haryana punjab western up and rajsthan there be many other farmer also and they have different produce different geographical condition sir be it not possible to have different farm law for different geography it would lead a healthy competition and if any state realise that neighbour state have some good law then they can ammend their law more developmental
10 month after the video adani offer mere 17rs per kilo in the place of 63rs before farm bill owe to low quality quality of the crop depend on climate a well

1 he say anyway the small farmer be already sell directly and they do not have any incentive to go for long distance they also do not need to enter into any contract and a per the bill the farmer can pull out of the contract without penalty but the buyer private player need to pay a penalty for pull out of the contract
if you now want real change then you have to defeat bjp electorally to save the integrity of bharat india hindustan whatever you want to call
it be crazy how unexpected the strong opposition to the bjp be no one not caa not nrc not the opposition no one could challenge the government but the farmer do not only challenge them but bring them down to their knee completely overwhelm them big respect to our farmer
because day by day there be only increase in price of compost diesel pestiside seed as well a there be not implement in crop price msp so a the end of farmer growth be decline it be so sad and not to be overlook by india farmer

these bill seek to bring much need reform in the agricultural marketing system such a remove restriction of private stock holding of agricultural produce or create trade area free of middleman and take the market to the farmer
who say farmer can not sell their produce in other state read 1976 top court order that say no govt can restrict farmer to sell their produce in other state which be result of similar agetation humara seb to chandigarh me bik sakte hai aur hum bechte bhi hai koi nayi baat batao youtuber ye batao agar ye coorporate nirav modi aur malya ki tarah paisa leke bhag jayenge to kya hoga baki mere farmer ka interview dekho aur fir in bill ko samjo
if farmer can combine to threaten to sit on protest for 6 month i m pretty sure they can amass mean to set up infrastructure for storage once this be do whole produce can be pool and revenue from sale can be distribute proportionately this will strengthen the need for chak bandi system which will result in farmer come together and unite farm size which can increase productivity with less input and more mechanisation govt have a long term outlook and not just for next couple of year game changer a you put rightly
do you know farmer in india do not pay income tax despite the fact that there be tax slab to take care of poor farmer why be it that none of these people cry injustice when investor in india have to pay income tax dividend distribution tax and later individual income tax with additional ce for the sake of subsidize their produce that no one be go to buy and be probably gon na end up with rat and insect in some govt warehouse these people should feel shameful that first they leave the nation that they now call home for a good lifestyle in a developed nation but when india implement reform to go in the same direction they have guilt the government into regress back to a licence raj regime
you be say private player be smart they will try to buy only on low price but farmer still have choice mandi will go nowhere if farmer do not like the price he will sell his good to mandi

1 a private company might monopolize yes will a government control msp be fair not really government for political reason can behave like a cartel or a pacifier government do not process improve msp will always be a dynamic number season to season and will need scientific technology to ensure the msp number work for farmer consumer and agricultural technology in a global sense be government equip to decrypt msp number with perpetual scientific advancement no they can not even predict weather pattern in india properly
1 if corporate sector come to firm each farmer can have individual contract so the govt will no way agree to future msp
more over government be willing to make amendment to the new reform include the assurance of msp so why the so called farmer be still protest do a fact check please
so basically you be worried about monopoly in this sector well we already have law for that if a corporation start exploit of the farmer or consumer then both will shift to another company market competition need to be maintain and that be where govt step in ask yourself why be internet in india so cheap it be because of market competition and buddy it work wonder
after one year of struggle and lose 700 farmer
i be look for a day when farming should be incorporate style and farmer should be assure with the best price and free of stress
i think yes these bill be a good step but i will say this too that these loophole should be cover up and first and foremost gov should listen to the problem of the farmer i be neither in support nor oppose to the gov
loop hole be in farmer intention too farmer take loan and default intentionally to get refund from govt every 5 year new govt come and pay of old loan all product be insure but they still ask for refund mostly punjab farmer be above poverty line there should be law that they cant sell agri land to go canada most sardar will start cry stubble burning cause soo pollution in our delhi but they still didnt stop it that show how low the farmer can fall too there shouldbe heavy penalty on that too but there be no action soo both side have big loophole but we didnt want to accept new law becoz it may exploit but they want all good benefit from it soo i dont support protest becoz thats baseless
farmer have understood how these law will destroy their livelyhood and give away everything to ambani adani corporation even bjp lawyer be not able to respond to farmer in debate
it be a very big l for modi and something do for upcoming election to please the people i always think these be very positive change and promoted productivity in agriculture to make india a powerhouse in term of food export but that be not to be and it will never be now if a full majority party bow down to these protest
people from a single state punjab by those so called farmer which be actually seller want to continue their monopoly over crop procurement and do not want farmer of other state become wealthy farmer of other state like up bihar wb be very poor and these farm law would be beneficial for them
the protest by farmer be 100 genuine then it the govt that be spread propoganda and blame everything on opposition

1 the farm bill hamper with the monopoly of apmc agricultural produce market committee mandis for many establish middleman this come a a sudden shock
the ground reality be that a large part of farmer support the new farm law majority except punjab and haryana
rihanna and greta of all the people know shit about indian farmer law and the interpretation of trevors reporter be misconstrue not the full story
isupportfarmers
at least we can do this much work for our farmer this will boost their confidence in further movement
he make his son yuvraj singh cricketer but want farmer to be terrorist jarnail bhindranwale
everything be not exploitation that way you can say that ola uber be exploit cab driver amazon flipkart be exploit small trader fact be farm be a risky business where the output be reliant on climate water and so many market factor and if the crop fail or there be over produce farmer do not even recover their cost of agriculture by introduce contract farming and corporate investment the risk and benefit could have be share with large company that way farmer be would have get a steady income and not commit suicide now we be back to old way i do not see any agricultural reform in the next 20 year it not bjp be loss but country be loss and it a big win for leftist medium communist like dhruv rathee
victory of farmer be the victory of democracy

dhruv if you be read this loan clearing be a big big scam run by farmer themselves i know my own family and friend who deliberately take loan and never never pay even one emi even though they have good income and wait for state election once the state election arrive everything boil down to candidate who be offer to waive off loan do we the white collar job have the headache of pay off tax when farmer enjoy maximum subsidy no doubt that few of the case would be authentic but the complete system be fail on the ground of ethic
total number farmer in india 16 6 million
vox should also make a video on how united state there country be pressure india in wto to remove support for farmer
government continue to buy good at msp in the mandis right then there be no loss for small farmer due to competition right small farmer who face competition can sell their good in the mandis right
like every profession farming be a profession too why just wheat rice and cotton farmer be protect because of this protection farmer be not produce enough of other crop result in over supply of wheat rice and cotton when the price of international market for these crop be low
still a farmer life always be a farming life
so to give some context the farm law be not that all bad it go to hit the farmer in panjab but on an average it will benefit the india farmer

prepration of up and punjab election
farmer can still sell in apmc i think until a bill be propose to remove apmc there be no need for the protest one cant protest base on speculation
2 the third bill intention be to bring a third party organization into farming and protect farmer from famine and other natural disaster while also increase the diversity of agricultural product which be currently very limited due to a lack of certainty in post harvesting income look at how much wheat production be increase in up mp and punjab and how mp recently cross 300 mt of wheat production in the year 20 21 which get waste due to very poor storage facility so the clarity would come from a proper dialogue with farmer and curb the weak area of law to make them legible and clearer which i think goi try up to some extent but we all saw what exactly happen if the implementation of these bill have be effective with proper clarity then it would have make farmer more confident and secure so they could have start think toward other farming option and process and may eventually shift towards organic farming as well
discipline farmer good people
you be right afterall this bill will benefit the big farmer only the middle class and the poor will pay more to buy daily essentialy item but the fact be that the govt have do nothing to relieve the small and the narginal farmer i do not think that private player will sign contract farm agreement the small and the marginal farmer
for congress and other party it celebration topic and use as much a possible to use farmer for politics

i be against modi about msp but when u say only 6 farmer be get benefit through this then farmer bill must come and today be the day farmer bill have pass hope it will change the situation of farmer their income and standard
now it be clear politically agenda this be not farmer protest
above all the anti indian regime want to corporatize procurement and lay gst on agricultural production want the nation to believe that all those tri farm bill be for good there be no regulation for demand production no storage facility again no fair price for harvest and the regime what claim be not high but plain lie at face
remember one thing india not all about punjab and farmer all not in punjab people come in mercedes benz and protest dont call them a farmer they be the middleman who loose comissions punjab be just a part where some middleman earn near 10 million dollar in the middle shame on you vice take some propaganda
i be here to see trevor make deep analysis of the farm bill technicality of the bill be propose and about where thing go wrong but instead i get to see only the usual clip of protest site and trevor sum up about the whole situation with inadequate information
this be a pay for play bill president modi have to pass for his special interest it will give corporation full power eventually over all food and if anyone have even iq they know corporation be all about greed profit and they will eventually keep increase the price
u shoud see in india farmer be die in protest but goverment be sleep
why be chief justice of supreme court not take any decision on these farmer protest president be also mute
a large amount of farmer also support these bill and reform sooo currently there be a clash between farmer who support it and farmer who do not and the government be in the middle one side be tell to remove these bill or they will protest and the other side be tell if it be remove they will protest
bjp didnt want to repeat the west bengal performance in up so well he take this decision immediately to atleast give a fight in up election
anything new especially something this significant be go to be challenge it be not surprising but then again with the amount of issue the farmer have face over so many year it be clear thee current system do not work i therefore can not stand with the farmer that they be not even willing to give the new system a go remember privatization of indian biz in 1991 this could similarly revolutionize indian farming
i support farmer but i do not support khalistanis because i believe in india i believe in united india from kashmir to kanyakumari
why do you think farmer be still sit in cold when over 100 people have die from cold
and modi be not scared bjp get more member than whole population of punjab
these bjp maniac be say even in the new open market system and in the contract farm bill in the least case these corporate turncoat would have to purchase commodity from farmer at msp accord to this bill
free market ka best example mtnl and bsnl that be why farmer oppose this i think so may be i wrong
2 in most case the amount eventually pay to the farmer be so small that farmer never reach home they give up return from mandi

it be beneficial for consumer indian government have do nothing different every development country have such law government should stop buying from haryana and punjab and force them to sell it too private company or die out of loan burden
farmer postion never go to improve
a a result farmlands in the u s be more productive bring back great return to the farmer a comparison between both farm show that u s farmland have a high yield per hectare than indias farmland for example in rice it be 7 8 tone to indians 3 tone in corn it be 8 6 tone to indians 1 8 tone in peanut it be 2 6 tone to indians 1 ton in soybean it be 2 8 tone to indians 1 1 ton in cotton it be 647 kg to indians 220 kg also the u cow milk yield be 3x more than the indian yield
honestly these new rule sound like how americas farm be be control and our farmer be also suffer because of the lack of control and predictability
full support to the farmer farmer be protest for more than 60 day in extreme cold climate at delhi more than 100 farmer have already die due cold climate govt should take back the new law
i support farmer

7 msps be not be remove congress rumor

dhruv what you be say be one sided narrative i suggest you debate with someone who be an expert rather continue with your rant i be from himachal pradesh and many of my friend and family member be apple grower they be free to sell their good wherever they get a good price for their good whether addani or out of the state they sometime sell their product in southern state directly i do agree it be a hasty decision and government should have take farmer in confidence msp have be a big failure in other country case in point be msp on milk product give in u result in a huge glut result in loss to exchequer and waste
request your platform to ask one question from the present government that today they be in power and whatever they say orally will be do till it be tenure but what about future government will they ensure msp if it be not in the act itself
i be remember my class 1 activity how samilar i support the bill

so guys what do you think the new farmer bill be right of wrong
it be interest how government intervention create the problem yet indian farmer rather operate under a centralized governance rather than a free market society although many job would be potentially lose in the process it would also benefit the economy a a whole history have show that competition can lead to increase in efficiency and can help to solve problem that could not have be counter without such competition even if farmer be entirely replace which would be an indication of consumer favouritism job opportunity would still be create and might favour those with an education or who wish to increase the quality of their life this be a process which have occur historically in many country that evolve from farm to industrialization it be almost a necessary sacrifice if society wish to evolve and thus should not always be resist
a lot of u here be in support of our farmer too also their brotherhood and solidarity with each other be absolutely heartwarming
5 there really will be no real movement of farm good outside local market by farmer as envision a this be already allow and do not take place globally sale of agriculture product be local and the trader sell it far out just think a farmer loading pineapple in a truck and drive to delhi because he may get a good price if i be the buyer in delhi i would give him a low price because i know i have him now this be crazy

this be result of unity of farmer of haryana punjab and western up
only panjabi farmer be protest it mean only 1 farmer of india be against this law so they can t impossed their idea over most majoritys farmer
but one thing be for sure and that the indian government start operation blue star specifically be aim to eliminate jarnail singh bhindranwale from the golden temple complex and regain control over harmandir sahib official report put the number of death among the indian army at 83 and the number of civilian death at 492 though independent estimate run much high which by no mean be a very sad thing and same the indian government be do in the kissan movement also anyone who can be use a a condom and later on thrown like tissue paper in a filthy bin will absolutely react a the assassinated sikh veers do in government orient operation blue star so my humble regard to my sikh brother and sister all over the world
che guevara be pic say all about education and intellect leval of punjab and our farmer
first and foremost we must think that who be protest obviously our farmer in a country if either soldier or farmer protest it mean something be fishy go
you show u massive farm own by u farmer in the beginning of the video your country already have privatise agriculture why do u have problem when my country try to do the same you mention mandis in your video yes it be a government sanction market where famers can sell their produce but the problem be these mandis be now be operate by middleman who fix the price of the crop the government be try to free the farmer from this and allow him to go to any market to sell his produce this have two implication a positive and a negative one positive one be that it will give the farmer more option to sell his produce and to the high bidder negative implication be that since he will not be use the mandi the government cold storage that come with it will be out of his reach and he will have to go to private cold storage to store his good however this can be overcome if the government invest in the infrastructure also but do you u give my government the chance to do this no do you educate your follower on this no
p to those who think that law be disastrous for farmer ask ur self why no one appeal against the law in supreme court
what about the rule which be imposes on farmer without a per normal bill and without demand by the farmer all the normal food in the market retail value finalize by the manufacturer why only agril food product be value by other it be good for farmer by govt i e mst but it be not implied 100 then what will farmer to do
government want to remove that middle man it be right and they just need to add msp in bill
unfortunately the large section of farmer fell into the trap lay by the anti national element
i have doubt why farmer prior to this act they do not get msp with benfic of mandis why tomotoes and onion be throw out side road by the farmer prior to this act

appreciate your clear analyse some point you have raise be hypothetical and for possible concern by farmer however the farmer should have list these issue clearly on the table when discuss in 11 meeting with the government they also fail to cooperate with the supreme court setup committee you may have a clear picture but the farmer union do not secondly what really happen in future be unknown if there be an issue it can be subsequently correct a i see it it will definitely bring good income to farmer my farmer relation be very happy that the middleman who take 2 5 commission in the past have be eliminate with the new law since the farmer do not pay tax on their produce this income be a major contributer to black money the new law will control the flow of fund because all go direct into farmer bank account there be more but i think this issue be so politicalized it benefit the opposition party who be fight for survival and therefore will keep this issue alive for sometime

just one question if these farm bill be so good then why do the union minister harsimrat kaur who be from bjp resign and why be there such a hurry to pass these law in the parliament when due to corona all the member be not present the only reason why farmer be protest be because they want a strict law on msp and modi a it be he be not a man of his word say that there will be msp then why dont they make a law on it the second thing be under this law it not mandatory for a company to make a write contract with the farmer for any contract farming so even if the company violate the term of the contract the farmer can not prove it and also can not fight this issue in the house of court and nobody ask you about what the congress tell in their manifesto and shit the topic be on farmer the government in centre should be ask question because they be the one who make the law not the opposition i use to think that you guy be genuine but no you both be nothing but a bunch of stupid literate bhakts who be portray a good picture justify each and every step take by their modig be good in evry way

8 now listen up our government to help farmer have a provision of minimum support price msp that be whatever the market situation be demand supply ratio other factor government will buy the crop of the farmer at a minimum price and not less than it to help the farmer make to their expense
now farmer have two way to sell their produce one at apmcs and another outside of apmcs if the private trader will not give msp to the farmer they have to choose apmc only for 23 yield and here education and awareness be necessary for farmer because private trader have high knowledge of negotiation when compare to farmer so farmer need to aware of market in their area

west bengal first start khela hobe now oppositions play the role of khela hobe all over the state be of india centre should take action against tikait akhilesh opposition plan to destroy india
but stil it be a victory of patience and struggle for farmer
context the new law be give freedom to farmer to sell their produce anywhere in country without interference government procurement system which be a long pending reform some people or i can say middle man have some vested interest so they be manipulate uneducated farmer by tell them that they will not get fair price of there crop and guess what those people be also leader of farmer and than there be whole religious and communist angle
investment from private player can introduce new technology good transportation many other direct indirect advantage this protest be creation of the fear by some political non political institution to put inside farmer mind that their mandi system be go to go away because of new law which be not also due to mandi system gov be force to buy produce only from few state and those state even have ultra rich soil only produce wheat or rice mandi system be not profitable system at the end it more of taxpayer money spend to give money to some rich farmer of few state while rest of the country farmer struggle for life need
they be so attached and commit to indian heritage that they do not even wan na live here and move to other country make alot of sense and these people do not get to protest for farmer do they protest when indian farmer be commit suicide because they could not repay a loan of 3000 usd
i be from odisha this be true that farmer in odisha can not afford such transportation and accomodation cost which be be afford by punjab and haryana etc state for the protest
up me yogi ji hai aur hamesa rahenge
ravish ji the way you have describe the movement kisan andolan be hearten the question that come to mind be why this kind of protest can not be organize by the employee of ofb bank other psu employee unemployed youth and the common citizen ask the government to stop talk about aruanzeb and instead focus on economy to initiate real development and not grand project the need be to have a functioning system in health care education law order function economy the leader can visit shrine etcetera and talk about it within their community smashing of coconut and invoke allah with a chant do not mean development real issue be to be address question should not be counter by chant of bharat mata ki jai least we forget it our forefather chant it to question and overthrow the colonial rule jai hind
that be show just one part of the story you completely miss out or choose to ignore the benefit that new system can bring to farmer and economy give freebie a be demand be not a long term solution a it eventually be fund by public
people who be say these bill be be good do they even know how these bill be be pass opposition be outside the parliament and bjp leader be pass bill be one after another without any discussion

i agree govt might have be wrong medium be wrong but i refuse to believe that those who climb red fort remove the national flag and place a regional flag be farmer i simply can not
govt supreme court should take immediate action against them
and he be a delhi resident who have farmer family in punjab
farming and manufacturing two sign of prosperity save farmer
why do you think ambaani be have already build storage facility in punjab already and request the haryana govt to allow building storage unit there
do that mean farmer protest all over india be a result of misunderstanding of the new law and mislead from opponent of central government i think so this protest be just like caa protest a few month back
it be much need consider what be go on in punjab no one be focus on what be exactly happen in the bill clarity be much require
1 farmer with elimination of grain market very few but big businessmen will purchase grain crop many farmer will be force to sell at low price also in case of dispute farmer can not go to court so there be a clear chance of exploitation of the farmer by wealthy businessman
when indian government bring new rule to help farmer in india a small section of illiterate goon stage protest and block the road and hijack the republic day during that the same vice be support them now when the old system be become obsolete and yield no result and more suffering to the farmer the same vice be show this report a typical example of a left leaning two face journalism hind hassan from vice try her best to portray india a a minority hat nation in kashmir but when she be make to look like a bat hijab and those talibanis laugh at her face she just fell short of word i love vice when it be a neutral medium outlet not when it be lapdog for liberal
i can guarantee one thing no one of them can tell all 3 bill that be propose by the modi govt

haryana and punjab have better ampc system then other state
ma be 2015 niti aayog data show that 81 percent farmer know about msp so why only 6 percent of them be use it please give some insight
thankyou for support farmer
farmer be expertice in their field but they be not expertice in legal field so if contract base farm get implement somewhere there be a chance of them get exploit
congratulation to the farmer i hope cloud of politics will be wash away and well draft law will be table
msp again about the bill
and not just about the farmer bill government in not implement any policy with any preparation just make policy and implement them government need to decode the thing before encode it into the rule
india must change it farming policy and practice farmer need to be provide reasonable support by the government so that they can make a decent living and not poison the land at the same time farmer need to revert to traditional farming practice so that they do not kill their soil with toxic pesticide and fertilizer they also need to go back to crop that can have small water requirement in order to deal with global warm farmer need to wean themselves off of fertilizer and bio engineer crop impose by the indian government eventually an impending disaster be in the making in which farmer will be leave with poisoned land increase debt low yield and inevitable famine india be a major power should be set an example for other country to follow not create ecological disaster that will make them laugh stock of the third world the whole problem with india be corruption hopefully they will mature a a nation and realize that reliable and competent government be simply a good solution for everyone
vote for a free punjab do not forget who put u in delhi and we have no need to go delhi if majeetia be not allow to do drug trading under the badal and captain party akali and congress party
this officer say that he be son of farmar then why he join police that mean the condition of farmer be really bad that be why the officer join police for good life be not it
you can compare with share market gold price or any commodity market where common people buy or sell on what rate be on board simple logic else in future koi kuch bhi rate laga k chote farmer ka exploitation krega
be our farmer be happy before these farm law do our country farmer dont want any new farm law ammendments
farmer can end agreement anytime they wish
2 compare bihar with punjab and haryana with bihar be like compare apple and orange bihar be population density be 5 time that of punjab high population land per person be low in india while punjab and haryana have high punjab haryana be rich not because of apmc if it be that simple every state would have have apmc by now it a way more cluttered
we need all of the farming bill back
only for oncoming assembly election this fellow withdraw that henious farm law but farmer never forget your arrogant apporoch against them
very interesting and valuable and a my opinion it be a dangerous bill kindly not allow this bill but need maximum msp under govt and govt warehouse to store his commodity timely and settle them immediately with maximum price
if it pinch our pocket then excess money flow will be in control and then demand of certain good will not increase there by we can control inflation for long time if private increase the selling price then for sure farmer also go to increase thier sell price so somewhat the will be keep stable if the price and supply be stable then demand for the good will not be raise if then no raise in demand then there be no surprusing price hike teach me if i m wrong
i really want to know what farmer be be protest about and this video help a lot thanks
modi and bjp try the best to not happen a national debate on this issue
india police brutality stop your violence against peaceful farmer demonstration
we be farmer not terrorist
first go and read farm bill
when be you release your video on the violence at singhu border by the nihang farmer
we be farmer we support kisan andolan
those canadian s who support farmer have support the same bill in wtc and also against india s subsidary policy to farmer in international stage to make it very less thats below 10
but there be many farmer who support what they do
it be very clear now why farmer be protest save the farmer
you lack in proper discussion of farm bill
what the hell be wrong with you people whose thumbnail have you even use be this person even associate with the farmer prostet either reveal the identity of this farmer or be ready to face the law for spread fake news you just can not make an innocent the face of riot this be not the 1st time you people be do it whenever someone do bad always the cover photo be a tilak carry person you people need to stop this propaganda
so proud of these farmer actually
what do you think about shekhar gupta be comment on farmer bill he seem to have do his homework and seem like spout the truth i be now confused
2 in the case of ola or uber the product use in the transaction be expensive to possess i e a car but in the case of food item it be difficult to do that a the product be cheap and it be relatively easy for the farmer to go and sell partial good in retail market retailer will also adapt to new challenge
i will always sapot to farmer
farmer need to ensure msp exists
just wan na say the face of the people who say modi ji ek baar jo faisla kar lete hai phir vo wapis nhi lete
election be due in punjab uttar pradesh etc this be the main reason
this bill be for benifits of farmer
farmer be well educate i would rather say much than our agriculture minister narendra tomar
the solution of this problem be farmer stop work feild if you work store all good do not sell market government come your door
thing be apmc middle man be not god man the torture and harrasment the farmer go through in their hand
it be not just the matter of bill the matter be also for the way of execution and the modi government execution be clearly failure a it be see during demonetization
this be not farmer protest any more now it be kalistan oppostion antiindian antimodi it be just 18 page law i bet 99 of these protester never read
2 a govt how corrupt it might be be after all answerable to the farmer public bcos public have vote power
in other hand many people be favor of these farm law and see this law a reform in indian agriculture sector the argument that the india farm sector economy be not do good from long time and demand lot of public govt money a subsidy loan waiver msp minimum support price also stats show only 7 total farm produce be buy under msp no govt in world provide such public govt spending in farm sector private sector involvement competition be necessary for reform and advancement of indian agriculture sector also corporate have do good for india in it dairy milk sector ex amul engery etc
india be different at least from here we see they treat farmer almost like trouble maker and untouchable indian government treat indian farmer a burden of the country a government especially a india claim it be a democracy should be for the people the majority of people in india be farmer the government should work for them serve for them but indian bjp government do not care about them at all
after watch this video i realize that there be many loop hole in ours previous mandi and also in these 3 bill
fight against fascism have become a common fight in india
kya kiya modiji apne vote ke liye economic reform se back off kar diya abb koi reform nahi hoga
thank you for your video you should see the plight of chicken farmer in canada when they make a contract with corporate supplier never get into a contract with these corporation it should be against the law it basic slave ownership in a new form
most of the farmer in india be fairly uneducated and live in poverty the problem with bill be that while it promote free market and open new possibility option for farmer it will encourage more and more corporates to enter in agri trade the contract farming will be encourage by these company who have lawyer who will exploit the loophole in system and put clause and condition in the contract to minimise the wage of farmer do you think a farmer will make round of court when it do not deliver on the contract due to bad weather similarly stock hoarding will be a problem in future a company will play a role in control price and demand just a in stock market do not forget that only thing that matter for corporates be profit
there be no corruption in punjab and haryana against farmer
we must also understand that in the long run the government want to get out of the subsidy market and offer good at market price these framework will ensure level play field for the farmer
this farmer bill be purely unscientific this type bill will not work in india
big win for our farmer brother next msp must be ensure to them
well explain however i d want to respectfully point out that there seem to be either a mild anti government bias or a little bit of ignorance you leave out certain envisaged benefit of the bill for example in point 2 due to inter state sharing of produce the food wastage can be mitigate the condition where one state be hungry and the other be waste a surprlus will be avoid this will also bring down overall price on the national scale
always with farmer repeal the controversial farm law
farmer be the law not bjp
ivide production fully farmer nte kayyil aanu distribution maathram aanu cooperate production nallathairikaan farmer ne kaalum cooperates aagrahikum so venda instruction and solution farmer nu cooperates highly qualified staff ne vechu nalkum eg fertilizer and pesticide normal reethiyil nammalkariyaam farmer include me rogam kandethi varumbozhekum plant nashichu pokum nilavile system anusarichu govt official ithinu munnittu irangiyaalum illankilum avarku fix govt salary labhikum ivide ithinellam cooperate munnitirangum
ok that comment at 3 28 be not correct there be no mention of withdrawal of government mandis in the bill please read the bill before make factual statement also note that the protest be primarily only in a single state there be no other protest against the bill all over india there be farmer in every state of the country the death rate mention by the report be largely from the other state not punjab which have a fraction of the total death rate if the bill be so bad this would be an all india movement instead of just one state a such the bill be good but the politics be bad which be what have lead to this situation
for the farmer who deserve more
half information be more dangerous than no information ur lie do debate on this with someone like me ill tell u what the hack be this game be all you be not a farmer u cant feel or know the whole truth of these all law
this medium be still protect modi ji
7 year ka bad bi modi poverty and food crisis ko dor kyu nahi kar pya what about inflation what about employment our godi medium never ask this type of question to the government

i enjoy almost all your video but you lose it here in the technicality of course your story telling be good a always but you make not mistake but blunder in explain the subject for example farmer be not the one who store their produce and then shove it in the marked for gain it be the post farmer buyer the big commodity business folk who do do that pls take it a a constructive criticism and keep do the good work lastly there be way more in such sensitive subject than what meet the eye or the black and white choose subject where you can do great justice
ndtv make a correction these be farmer of haryana and punjab not whole country we be support it
it be mean it be clear that private player want to purchase farmer crop less than msp
by the way the use of real onion in this video do not make me cry but the condition of farmer have really make
india mei sirf election e hota hai fuck democracy
this be the most pro farmer bill india have pass to date it literally make it so government can not control the price you sell your crop the only negative part of this bill be the regulation that say you can not utilise 3rd party company to sell your crop other than that it be great and it not neo liberal it be capitalist if you want an example a to what happen when government control the price and flow of resource just look at the soviet union or china under mao not anymore tho now china be just politically communist and economically capitalist
congratulation it a historic day especially the farmer pass 2 farmer bill become act soon
i do not know all the farmer in india be only sikhs
you be assume that farmer be smart and they will sell it to private player at increased price
mandi what u heard be a place where u sell ur crop and it be operate by govt until the recent farm law
people who eat food support farmer and respect their hard work because they be right new farmer bill be only for private sector modi govt be totally fail in india
lack of consultation first the ordinance route and now the hastily attempt to pass the bill without proper consultation add to the mistrust among various stakeholder include farmer
apmc be actually congress make system for establish corruption on regular basis

support farmer and sikh brother
it be heinous act by government to provoke farmer to show violence while they have be protest peacefully for almost more than 50 day they do their best to provide food to each and everyone but their own country leader do not listen their voice
nobody in india believe modi anymore if he do not callback farm bill 100 bjp lose up election now modi be no1 pappu of india
u clear all issue regard this farm bill
do not sell your land to indian government or to other people it be your god give gift to be farmer
i think opposition need to follow farmer fight for not only democracy but also for the right of people if they be serious
modiji know for tuff decision but this be unfortunate for few anarchist you can not forget rest of 99 99 farmer i be very sad today if political decision to be take then so be congress
support farmer who grow food for mankind not the politician who eat human flesh
raise minimum support price be not the solution expert have point out that only 6 of all farmer benefit from public procurement at msp
the government be wrong to rush the bill not listen to the farmer use force at first but after the proposed amendment accept and guarantee ensure it the ego of the protester fight now they be not get into any sort of dialogue the whole issue be now a ego clash
i support indian farmer
proud to be an indian salute to these farmer from punjab and haryana
1 agitation by buyer middleman apmc trader but all of this be still go on and we be look forward to benefit farmer
some ppl be say this be rich ppl not farmer
i do not think msp should be legalize we already know govt do not have enough resource during this time and we also know that how effectively govt machinery work billion ton of wheat rice be be waste due to huge procurement of only this type of crop by fci instead govt should decrease msp on this crop and should increase msp and can be make legalized for those crop which be in huge demand in usa and in eu because not all type of crop be be sow in this temperate climatic condition crop diversification be need so that indian can get nutrition from variety of crop share your thought on this dhruv please reply to me i be wait for your reply since time immemorial
america itself do not provide any msp to it farmer
all good but also ask yourself be the only farmer in india be punjabi sikh where be the farmer from other state
if they do not want it why should he take all the blame let the farmer decide their future they will surely regret one day no one can save them unless they decide to save themselves
farming do happen in other area except for punjab btw but the major problem for ignore here which be land fragmentation largely farmer be have more and more son and per caput land availability be decrease to just 2 to 3 h of land compare to 444 acre of usa
this would have make india top agriculture exporter it would have increase farmer income
please dont cry far and expect help when more farmer be drive to loan debt and end up in suicide
bro i understand you be against bjp or current governament but do mean rakesh tikait be right you remember muzaffarnagar riot he and his father be there to provoke people and play hindu muslim and say these be politician we know how they play with sentiment of people you please dont spread such wrong information hope you know how inconvenience be cause due to these protest if you travel or drive by road from delhi you will understand pain of local or small business person pain please vote right people next time and change the system these farmer also do not have right to disturb and harm other people be liveliness we be here we know this pain so please
if after all these thing some people still support modi govt then i do not really think these guy will ever understand they be just too deaf and blind by toxicity andhbhakt for a reason
your tittle good or bad for farmer do not match your elaboration your concept good to write in exam a we be not suppose against government policy

didi this bill be 20 good but 80 be bad bcz today be i sell my crop in 8 per kg where government say msp be 18 r per kg but big miller and binyas be give u there own rate they also konw farmer do not have any storage capacity and the crop which be cut down that we can not store more than 2 day in our trali obviously farmer will sell his crop in cheap price and after that they will sell same rice crop in 100 r per kg to our people in market where farmer be force to suicide bcz we have laons and we buy the fertilizer and pesticide in high price and bank laon interst and for next farming we need money who will put desile in our tractor
once again india will devided in 3 part a khalistan jk and india
half of indias budget will go for msp that be just for landed people basically assured income for any quality of crop money for msp come from industrial and sale tax from industry base primarily create by landless factory worker and labour both in construction as well a farm farmer under the pretext of employ labor want to pocket lakh of money a msp just because they hold land land price have increase 10 time in 30 year these farmer be fat farmer any farmer than own 10 acre be make 12 to 15 lakh of tax free income these farmer be steal sweat of landless 80 of india be landless see this below
protester have common people be support until few day ago when it turn violent this be due to some extremist push the free khalistan ajenda now protest lose it meaning endanger country be sovernity i support them at one point but when the extremist drive tractor over police and push them over the 10 15 foot ridge that be just brutal
in the starting of the video he say that they talk to all trader farmer nd industry etc but how do we know that u do show a clip atleast of the conversation
bjp party desh ke liye congress party rajniti party ke liye congress party pariwar bachao party hai jay hind
7 imagine thousand of people block road for 2 month who be feed them it be fund by khalistani support organization
more power to farmer they be the real hero of our nation
plz see from farmer side
one draw back be politician will loose commission income which they use to loot from poor farmer for the last 70 year and their cartel can not decide the selling price of any produce of farmer no doubt state govt will loose 10 mandi tax levy on poor farmer but state govt can easily make up for the above loss by increase the tax on liquor cigarette etc or by curtail the free bee give to rich people like free scooter give to work woman free laptop give to student of rich people free ration give to govt employee tax payer free deepavali and pongal gift give to affluent family levy 10 tax on donation receive by trust own and operate by politician levy 10 ce on pension money receive by politician like mla mp municipal councillor etc a the donation receive by any political party and the pension receive by mla mp councillor etc be exempt from income tax state govt can levy just 10 ce to compensate the loss cause due to forecasted reduction in revenue on mandi tax etc
great win of the farmer against the government
excellent presentation so basically we common people be go to affect there will be monopoly in market government want to give free hand to corporate once they take up procurement and distribution they be go to keep what ever price they want so common man will be affect like how petrol price be increase essential good price will increase we consumer should protest this bill thanku for the video
i m indian with few of my family farmer now leme tell you the news be seriously wrong and bias many farmer think nothing of the law and most think it a good thing few in 2 state dont like it now you know

i proud to be punjabi and i stand with farmer
this protest be base on a thinking that government will close mandis and msp but govt have make it clear that they wont
farmer can not do this extra job they need help service

i m a muslim in support of india be farmer
i wonder why they say we be not in need of these farm bill instead of say these bill be go to hurt their business be they afraid that the farmer of other state too will be able to sell their produce to the corporates
if america medium can understand the plight of indian farmer and consequence of these 3 bill why not indian medium
i i m proud of my farmars ji jaban ji kisan thanks to bbc news
they have forget one thing which i should correct that new law restrict farmer to sue corporates accord to the new law farmer can not sue corporates so in short they have close the gate of court for farmer
seem like you have be miss news of farmer throw aways their potato tomato because of very low price
farmer be be more intelligent than the govt
fyi average land hold in india s 2 5 acre so who benefit rich farmer at least that be what i get from your explanation of farm bill 2 you be play with food security of country by brine in private company
we farmer just want obligatory right from govt not compulsion if any
our pm can not pull such crowd any time but farmer be unity for justice have break the record
farmer hold a good debate they be answer all question nd be totaly well inform
they be killer of farmer
very sad to see rajewal go with the politics party let be see what happen next skm should stay together and strong farmer should support skm decision indian from uk
very poor report not speak about the truth about the government and the farmer bbc seem more pro for the government than the poor farmer
this same thing happen when the privatization of electricity in 2002 take place but we almost increase our capacity to produce electricity 4 time after privatization of this sector the protest also happen when the liberalization of indian economy take place but we know how it help to uplift india economy now it time to liberalize farm sector whether people like it or not but those who know little bit about economy know that these law definitely improve the condition of farmer especially the farmer of bihar up bengal who have most fartile land but due to the government policy be they be poor punjab just afraid of not get cheap labour from these state because after this law the farmer of these state become more phosphorus
farmer not win be just politics by modi
india be industrialize so the farmer who lose their job now will go to the manufacture amd service sector
14 34 in village people almost buy vegetable fruit directly from farmer
we have to support our farmer
let be hope for best come out from this government rule for our farmer
why there be no farmer be strike in other state why it be confine to vicinity of new delhi only when center have assure supreme court that this law will be keep in abeyance for two year then why this strike
there be not a single point to defend these law even if they r so called benefical in ur eye farmer do not want it so take it back what be the big deal wesupportfarmers
bro please make a video on ongoing farmer protest godi medium be not show the right picture
so basically the rich farmer be worried that the poor farmer will start earning and take their piece of cake and so protesting
i do not understand why this decision have be take but the reason must be compel i do not think this have anything to do with election bjp have lose many state election why would modi damage his image and the welfare of people for state election
there be no apmcs or the mandi version in america
socha nhi tha ye sirf medium soch rahi thi jisko politics ki samaj hai vo janta tha ki sarkar palte gi election se theek pahle
when bill come there be so much view point and discussion and propaganda but during repeal they do not even give point for take it back which he hold for 1year 3month and cause so much tragedy quarrel several policeman and farmer die and no sympathy to those people and still say like prime minister show mercy for take it back spit on such a cowardness when pass the bill he speak the all three bill himself but when take back he pass out his message to his minister for not have a courage enough to show his face it be shameful for our prime minister
there be a power in unity it have be long time to protest against law but finally farmer have win a great victory
one thing i would like to tell you be that during the mandi system there be no assurance of msp and if you look at the rule and regulation you will that msp be never a legal mandate however the current farmer be bill will enable corporates to exploit that loophole to great advantage
they be say bihar be lag behind due to reform but bihar be growth rate have be much high than punjab and haryana punjab have be lag behind in growth rate for a long period of time people should stop project bihar a a no use no growth state
it be show clearly they be fully fund from outside to rakesh and want our india never and ever be develop country
this seem like start of end of project india even though something be good for the nation all you have to do be resort to violence and the necessary reform will be repeal even though protest be largely in 2 small state india have world be large land under cultivation and our farm output be only 60 of china nothing can be do of this country sad
if there be no apmc an intermediate bw farmer and coporate then the farmer will become the doll of coporates the farmer will be force to what coporates say
one should try to understand that bjp be try to save kagana and gear up for up election
someone show this video to the govt opposition party and our farmer
excellent no word proud to be punjabi proud to be kisan majdoor ekta always win truth congratulation never forget veera great song
you be factually wrong here msp have nothing to do with apmc price discovery apmc always buy below msp and 3 be not the charge they differ
this be a bad decision to repeal imo because it provide more freedom and opportunity to farmer but i hope in future the government have some good plan for them and have good communication skill whilst introduce the bill
idea of r be the current future of india
moreover you didnt even mention about the entire toolkit propaganda by the pro khalistani group and the commie try to divide india
we r farmer and my whole family and village be do farm but not protest any one because they be not have time sikh be lose their credibility
so if farmer have granary or storage place then they can stock or else they can keep on sell it in apmc on msp or even to private entity again there be no compulsion
vice news should have cover more aspect like green revolution chemical fertilizer usage msp policy fci policy ground water depletion middle men system stubble burn farm law private investment soil issue pro n con punjab would have be a good case to many state
exploitation of farmer in india have be go on from british time unfortunately this sector have be be ignore by subsequent govts
i support farmer but not only in india but also in whole region
i be also belong to farmer family
punjab election be near
support to these farmer
my father be a farmer and i understand this well
this be all because of msp and apmc
stupid statement farmer be enough intelligent than this guy they be not stupid who suffer chill winter season heavy rain and extreme heat on the road if these law in their favour they accept now no mean to criticize them
farmer be tough my own personal witnessing
all responsibility of all kisan die in kisan movement to rakaish tikait and arrest him and also drop in tihad jail
no law be absolute there always will be loophole that can be plug with time so the clause by clause discussion be need with the farmer to end this dead lock
the farm law be pro farmer it be anti middleman i be a farmer from south india fully support government of india
this bill be could be implement with cover loophole atleast a law which keep earning profit in ve for farmer may be msp or some different way to establish the same
from your video it be evident that these bill be advantageous to farmer then why farmer of punjab and haryana be protest these bill be for their own good then what make them oppose these decision
i think the video be regard the protest why police and government be try to stop the farmer by all mean that would have be wonderful anyways i guess this channel aint about criticise the people in power
most of them be punjabi sikh minority in india hmmm
very good a clear picture of government ruthlessly ignore the protest of these peace full farmer
jai kisan this be what peaceful protest can do congrats to all the farmer u guy be real hero
we the people of india be in great trouble our family member be farmer and we be afraid of lossing them all
so refreshing to see punjab and haryana together waheguru mehar bnaye rakhe please please do not fall for syl politics ask your leader about the ground water first and then syl issue will automatically lose the relevance politician just want to divide u and rule u but this revolution should be milestone in strengthning bond balle sheron
you know i can never shake off this feeling that he be scheme something big we can never be sure with modi shah for all we know this could be a move to secure an alliance with sad and reduce the strength and talk point of the opposition something big be on it way the last time i felt like this be when bjp form an alliance with pdp in j k and we all know how that go
ahh i like your complete perspective analysis but this topic be about farmer economy should have be deal with some hard fact analysis this poor pj be not at all funny
farmer can sell their crop anywhere
excellent analysis by dhruv you could have add one more point about how big corporates can backward integrate into farming and take the livelihood of farmer but great video i have no doubt that corporates do not have any interest of farmer at heart and would sell produce at usurious rate to consumer repeal these contentious farm law be the only option at this stage
i be an indian farmer i will tell you this this issue be relate to only 2 state that be punjab and haryana no where else farmer be protest in india for a long time farmer in punjab and haryana grow at the expense of other farmer in india now that their monopoly be break they be cry about it i repeat i have no issue with the farm law bring by government of india
actually the reality be that farmer really dont know what to do and what to not they all blind fool by some else all they need be to understand the bill and in deeply and then must have to unite together with peaceful protest not by damage gov property
repeal three law yeah and repeal the nationality law and ban the imf and world bank and forgive all farmer debt and subsidize small farm and invest in rural and poor community and invest massively in infrastructure and abolish caste discrimination and
i think it be a good law for the farmer but government should also ensure that apmc market will be continue in such a way a they be run now
excellent video with simple explanation i do not know what i m miss but the benefit of these bill definitely seem to outweigh the risk the genuine loss will be state revenue by way of mandis there be the intrinsic reality then there be politick difficult to tell apart fact from fiction even for u let alone the farmer it be quite clear that bjp be really bad at communicate legislation to the public clearly
very detailed and perfect explanation of farm bill
one of the other main problem that i see in india be that there be no regulation for check and maintain quality of the vegetable that be buy and sell in these mandis seriously our food quality super low
that be not a life to spend money to fee the rest of the country every meal be a loss for every farmer
i support farmer
i support this bill
farmer must stand united stick to their demand of officially repeal the farm law in the parliament provide msp a a guarantee by way of a fresh bill of parliment
very good initiative big medium house rarely show this protest very proud of farmer conviction
pm modiji have declare it but still hutiya be ask it in write bade sakt londe ho bhai
hey isnt there another thing tht these farmer can not approach the court in case od dispute and some local dovt official will resolve the dispute
why the farmer of india earn very less compare to most of the country despite good economic growth
bro the most patient people be mathematicians not farmer
congratulation to all the farmer
do these farmer have access to internet one way to stop this pollution and exploitation of farmer be to stop produce food for others they must produce food for themselves in order to stop make other rich
all should do a google once to know the detail of farmer suicide across the country for decade and the root cause and which govts fail utterly
whenever i watch india street food i be amaze with how much the food cost it be really really cheap even much cheap in my country which beg question be farm bring any financial benefit to the farmer genuine question
it be again a drama to finish the andolon so farmer should be alert
may be the bill be good then why do not mention they msp clause
i belongs to farmer family we lose nothing we gain nothing if govt do hit and trial method with farm law then we exactly know it be give u profit or loss farmer with large land or small land be ok but in between farmer who have nor large nor small land get hit because tractor and all other machine be expensive
mayavati brainless leader she be chor welcome modiji in punjab hindu dharm ki jai ho jai hind
i be upsc inspire so this video very clearly understood farm bill sir thank you so much
inhone to fact basis baat karo hi nhi ki teeno bill main exactly kya hai bill totally in favour of farmer bus ek do amend ki jaroorat hai
no farmer no food
i feel very pity for farmes but modi will rule a p m for more than 10 to 15 or so for sure so you just can not put his government down
what could happen be that indian real estate company buy up indian farm and sell that land to blackstone blackstone can use that land for industry mining or farming except the worker would be the former farmer another major problem be that the law state new delhi manage the entire process and not the local area the 3rd law go into detail what new delhi can do not only the farmer but local restaurant to the family diet be lose this be not limit to the farmer but effect the cultural food chain of each community that make up india
a time will come when farmer will demand in agriculture rule
i loove india be food please do not make the farmer suffer
a strong wave form against bjp this condition 100
1 the modi govt respect the farmer there have be govts that quell farmer protest in a week with bullet hint congress
in any country the farmer be poor and work the hard but the money the make be little thus gov should do more for them to secure agri sector a it be so important
pm have regrettably give into the andolan jeevis and it be regrettable the egg be on his face now what ever political expediency derive out of it will be a small gain compare to embolden the break india force and their agent with their workable tactic the loser be the poor farmer and the credibly of the government if they want to relent he could have leave it with the state to take it up or not
sir u both be do great job but one thing be more important that farmer have to take their stand and genrally problem of price be when onion be cultivate and rate increase more farmer actually cultivate it lead to decline in price we should smartly manage own village or area cultivation their requirement and storage young youth should actually actively be part of it bcoz if farmer arent able to deal with industry then this be responsblity of their child to handle it atleast rate of his product will be fix
power to the farmer let goooooo
nothing but fool the nation everybody be only try to prove to which gang or which party the criminal be rather than immediately find the truth and punish the criminal consider the anti farmer attitude that the new urban and social medium india have these incident happen be not surprising not sure whether the modi and yogi brigade considers this a a great achievement of develop up

1 govt be make verbal claim on msp but not mention them on the farmbill2020 to empower farmer incase of exploitation by corporate
it start with rahul gandhi tractor rally in punjab
farmer in canada of indian heritage live in big mansion they hold caravan drive in their luxury car in support of the farmer in india i dont have a point just state an observation
i appreciate foreign medium cover up the story but it be show one side of the story that be responsible for the derision of the real farmer for the last 70 year these guy be block road demand a different state read about khalistani separatism under the garb of peaceful protest educate yourself before mock the government who be bring farm reform to benefit the farmer to enable them reach their dream more farmer be support the reform than the people who be protest and call themselves farmer

all i wan na say be that these be not the real farmer some might be real but if they be then by now india would probably start face food shortage it be over 8 month still everything be normal across the country however it make me wonder it be 8 month still those people be protest how can they manage their family like this arent they face money shortage how be they able to afford their living price who be fund them
it happen when u bunk class of mathematics add 3 4 zero extra and the news become sensation 250 million more than population of uttar pradesh bro u should say thousand that suit 250 million 8 9 time population of punjab 10 15 time even more than population of whole jaats in india in which some be protest

inqlab zindabad i m from india i m with farmer
this be not an unbiased view the bill will also bring in good way of farm improve the life of farmer improve quality of product new technogies through good investment improve export and many other factor which be not explianed here when new policy and law come there will be reluctance to change a some may get affected but over period of time this definitely be good for the future of indian farmer agriculture and economy
where be the huge farmer though
i come from an india where a standup comedian be a feminist during the day and become a r pist by the night
nice but one confusion by remove certain item from essential commodity how the income of farmer be go to increase big player can easily fluctuate the price by hoard and release massively accord to their need like when they need to buy from farmer they release the stock in market in huge quantity and tell the farmer that look the price be down and the farmer will sell their product at low price and after that they again start hoard and reduce the supply in market thus raise price so how the farmer get benefit out of this
now please end this conversation if farmer be happy then india be happy
the bill be pass without consult the farmer in like 3 minute in the parliament and now modi have cancel the winter parliament session cause he be afraid of farmer and be say it be do due to covid but in bengal he be campaign for election no covid

mr noha if u have time please go and read the bill these bill be just give option to farmer for trading may be this would be comedy for u bcz u live in usa where this would not cause any protest but there be many ppl who will use vedio for instigate farmer in india
let me just confirm one thing a an indian supporting farmer protest these khalistanis have nothing to do with these protest that be completely a matter of indian policy making and all these idiot who just show up with kalistani flag to show support for indian farmer will not be acknowledge a a part of the protest but an opportunity to assert khalistani autonomy
till date nobody explain briefly what be benefit of farmer from these law and what be loss we can do protest nobody be go to stop but do public property damage no way we need very strong law against mob who do this suppose if your car motorcycle they damage who be go to pay delhi road and all other infrastructure for the public we have no right to damage those infrastructure if i be home minister i fire delhi police commissioner and all dcp they can not control and make plan why do we pay them and give so much facility and power they do not have good training and strategy for this type of problem we need proper people who can manage who be fuck give them tractor trolly permission on 26 jan fire them include netas
minister yogi ji to this police officer zor zor se bolkar sabko scheme bata de
it be a very wrong decision it show that the government be weak and lack the willpower to go through reform 80 farmer who be supportive of these law have nowhere to go now it show how hooliganism have win it distressing nobody have win but nation have lose a big opportunity
have the farmer think about learn to code
update the central govt have now agree on 2 of the 4 demand of farmer who be protest against the farm law
pepsi case have no relevance here you have use a bad example pepsi withdraw the case in 2019 after government intervention and this case be not relate to contract farm or what the farmer concern be today
thank you for such a sensible explanation at a time when the political party and the farmer of certain state be not willing to understand the real part of the bill
neutral opinion it be true that khalistani be hijack the protest but modi say msp tha msp he msp rahega but not willing to give it in write kya bakchodi he be
i m not a supporter of any party i wonder why other state farmer be not make much noise like punjab now do not tell me punjab be bread basket of india each state in india produce different type of food example some say andhra pradesh a rice bowl of india and how can we forget spice state kerala communist
farmer be innocent hard worker hope government try to educate them about the empowerment and benefit of the bill pass it only because of state government politics and misguidance which have lead to chaos not at all farmer be fault nor the central government be fault if farmer be worried then government have to convince them and make sure corporate company treat farmer equally a a business partner and do not exploit them once mandi system be remove only then farmer will be able to think out of the box hope we see farmer evolve and be the rich and happy citizen
it be the bad bill in the history of india
passenger and farmer both be blaming government but still government will be arrogant till his last breath
for anyone wonder what happen to the protest despite of many problem and hardships the protest continue and finally the government withdraw all 3 farm law the farmer win
you mean that new farm law be overall good for farmer
only thing which i get to know that farmer should get educate should show unity like other trader so they will not exploid by private company
long live the farmer will win this war do not give up hope entire world be with the farmer
the protest of these farm bill be happen all over the country the people of punjab and haryana be more prosperous and able to stand up against these harmful farm bill these farm bill will harm all the state of my country big fish eat small fish do that make sense to you if not then there be no point in try to convince you to open your mind and see the long term negative impact these bill will have
long live farmer of our country
o god please give energy to farmer for every success
not fully explain she make the video in favour of govt she skip many point why we farmer be protest and she try to focus only on punjab just like govt
still he be blame farmer that they disregard such an honest decesion of krishi qanoon
tikait ji yeah tho bol do yaar vote for bjp only
awesome but i do not get that acc to third one how it will boost farmer income
pathetic apology by modi he basically say i be sorry you farmer be too dumb to understand we know good what be good for you then you would know yourself
but government not hear to amendment in new farm bill
i would like to understand what the notion be for the 3 law surely not to harm indian farmer
you can not kill farmer then hope not to face death sentence law be equa for all
i would also question the premise that the amendment to farm produce trade and commerce bill will result in minimal benefit to small farmer who anyways sell outside of ampc already and do not have the mean to sell to different state this be a fairly conservative view base on current state of technology and business model this can change immensely with change to technology and if private player get into distribution and e commerce style of operation of agricultural product a good number of low income small farmer do have access to internet and mobile already
these farmer with no formal education make more sense than government be economic advisor great content please make more such video
great to see everyone support poor farmer modi should not kill indian farmer and their family otherwise someone might try to do something
the united state subsidize it be farmer for a variety of reason some of them illogical and some of them logical i do not know much about india be farm system i wonder who india be try to benefit by make these reform increase their stock market price attempt to lower the price of food attempt to increase export i have no idea and i have more question than i have answer but it look like those local farmer will become more of a part of some big corporation more than anything else if i be hear this correctly
we can take inspiration from other country and try to implement them with some change for example we can see how farmer in u s a sell their produce
why do not german govt give same farm law to german farmer as well do this channel understand these farm law atleast
to all the foreign named handler we indian know that these be not real farmer well majority of them we do not give a damn to your view modi govt work for farmer
80 of indian dont know what be these farm law first they should know this
this bill benefit all the state except punjab we can not worry about one state and other state suffer show bbc clip prove nothing they be a stupid news organization motivate by their support to congress
shameful act do by farmer at lalkilla
where be indian flag these be khalistani flag what if other country also support terrorist organization
or election jeet liya ha ab bechare kissano par itna atyachar galt baat ha maan jao modi ji
dhruv i hear from some farmer who be force to sell if they enter the apmc abhi tak farmer ka benefit sab dealer earn kar rage he let the farmer come in open market price of food will go high but farmer will benefit
prime minister modi act like a dictator and do not like democracy he do not want to listen to the poor farmer but want to give business to his friend ambani and adani the corporates who help him to fund election and manipulate it need to show compassion and sympathy for farmer who be out in drastic weather for more than 2 month
more than 80 farmer be illiterate and as well a who live in the area like up bihar jh mp wb etc be give no reaction and bad thing be that they be still
2nd protest in one year in delhi and this the second time when protest turn into violence just because of bjp first protest be against caa nrc and now farmer protest narendra modi be follow hitler be ideology
if these jahil rich farmer do not leave our court must intervene and kick them out from our delhi border enough ticket pls go and do farm
so the rogue farmer claim that they can not loose the amenity of sell good to government at msp and liberalisation of sell food good to private and other state can make it unprofitable there be 28 state in india some facing drought and some facing great yield base on climate take this in note so the current thing can help the farmer to stabilize hunger
lastly 5 to 50 be very difference and if we skip this it will be 2 to 80 in future here the government both central and state be a mediatory and we the consumer and farmer together help each other to eliminate all middleman
2 i think government be also create monopoly government should maintain apmc mandis alongwith with private trade
thank you so much dhruv sir for take about indian farmer
even after the tuticorn massacre of innocent civilian by corporate goon jaggi still support the corporation and go against the interest of people there
great job lalantop it realy feel like i be there in farmer protest jai javan jai kissan

thank you brother for support farmer
deregulation and open market strategy in india have mostly benefit stakeholder big example be 1991 farmer who produce crop other than rice wheat be likely to benefit from this more because an open market would give them more competitive pricing with mandis it be easy for politician to collude with wholesaler in my experience in india you d rather do business with corporates than politician
if this bill be pass adani and another big player will make big storage unit to control price in the long run because of the removal of jamakhori act the price of grain will increase a lot and normal people will suffer and the poor even more so it not just a bad thing for wheat and rice farmer be it bad for everyone other than few billionaire
i hope this farmer get justice

4 now on why mostly farmer of punjab n haryana be protest be because these two state have the best n functional mandi system in the country n msp on many farm product in real sense for instance for one quintal of wheat in punjab farmer get around 1500 to 1600 where a the same thing in bihar farmer have to sell it for 800 to 900 no wonder why farmer from mostly these two state be protest in india government have define msp on many food item but there be no bind law to support the same nor implemented a every state have there own system now that be one of the demand of the protest farmer a law on msp
farmer want loss
standwithfarmers

every plan or act have two side one be positive and other be negative this act have also some negative point like no judicial review no regulation for consumer but apart from this it be the best reform take by govt that can connect farmer with the outside market the take away of this act mean that farmer have lose a opportunity to earn a huge profit which be their right and i be tell all these thing by stud all the farm act and circumstance of this act not just like dhruv bhaiya who be show only one side and not the other side of farm bill
about msp it not as simple a make it sound if you look at the supply chain of the produce buy at msp it mainly by purchase for pds public distribution scheme and for maintain adequate level of storage in case future threat to food security right now the msp be uncompetitive in open market mean the excess grain can not be sell a it would be way cheap to import the same lead to wastage of the stored produce hence cause huge loss to exchequer if msp be set to international price then there be no roi for the farmer for few of the grain make it difficult for ensure food security in case of war or any other calamity be to strike then import supply chain will be at risk
there be many farmer who be educate more than u
god bless modi sir long leave modi sir and long leave india
these farmer be make a religious issue of something to do with the income they hold a religious flag on a symbolic position of power just prove that their intention be not economic but some sort of politico religious act
the repealed law do nothing to the subsidy but allow farmer to diversify their crop because they could then sell to buyer other than the govt if they want the repeal of the new law essentially keep the exist system which drive thousand to suicide apart from the cancer and other ailment that the practice cause
if if if farmer be pay the fair value of their crop they would then be able to reinvest in their farm educate their child and provide healthcare for their child

you should join any dalaal news channel if the government want the welfare of the farmer why be the msp remove
12 fraud and cheat who try to avail the scheme or fool the farmer with false hope
company will provide them so in order to attract more and more farmer
so folk who vote for bjp it be a wake up call for you you hv to defeat them in election so you get what be need for common man
ig the only solution to this problem be by pass a law which ensure mandi will never stop so farmer always have another way out if corporates try to manipulate
best indian pm of all time to me jawaharlal nehru and ab vajpayee modi could be among them or so they think the medium need something to change i hope it and wish for it someday
we can not say every youth think the same because they be live in big cuty they do not have any idea about farmer life but their be many youth who join farmer protest because they know what the farmer go through and will go through after impose these law
i support farmer thanks for share
the tragedy of our country be that majority of city youth be unaffected by the ground reality of the country supportfarmers
2 in punjab and haryana arhthiyas donot get very huge commission they get 4 comission here that be for every 1kg rice sell at msp of 18 50 rupee they get comission of 85paise in which they have to unload the produce clean it weigh it sell it and get the money back to the farmer arthiyas earn money here by lend money on a certain interest to the farmer thats their main source of income and not the comission from farmer rest of the state do not develop and regulate the mandi system like we do and hence farmer get exploit there
be fund farmer agitation because they have a vested interest in
unfortunately the video be not research throughly essentially this be a protest by upper caste jatt and jaats who be hold the country hostage and preventing reform and progress of other farmer their monopoly over the price and distribution will tumble and thus they be oppose these law vehemently
the so called farmer well wishers have do nothing to ameliorate their plight maximum farmer suicide u take place in maharashtra a non bjp state

jai hind it be the time to take strict action on tikaith he be mingle with opposition party and with khalistani
hey brother 5 rich farmer can not control the future of our i be also farmer you should know that those 5 have lot of money
3 you say that farmer will not benefit as much a consumer but in free market economy an equilibrium be achieve by demand and supply thus why would a farmer go directly to a retailer if he be happy to get msp he can go to the apmc for that he will go to the retailer to get a good deal a retailer too will also give him a good rate than msp a they too have avoid the middle man and will still get a high margin
you forget to mention that a lot of these agricultural law on farmer be leave behind by the iron fist control of the british raj which be more interested in feed greek and british soldier in wwii than the indian population see the manufactured holocaust famine in bengal thanks to churchill

ppl should explan farmer which be good for farmer
delhi people also sport the farmer this be only one sector not in loss they always battle performance then why need new low
there be few thing that you could have explain as well like what impact these bill will have in future an example of similar thing happen in past why this approach fail in western country and how bihar be do now since they have implement these law in past i be not a farmer and not bias either but see the long term impact of these bill on them clearly
this be absolute nonsense the three farm reform be be recommend by agri expert for decade the mandi system have fail to improve the income level of indian farmer and the govt have do maximum already private investment and new mandis be a necessity please do not give one side perspective about thing you do not understand at all
farmer have some doubt regard farm bill and bjp government hold talk with farm union like akali dal etc and bjp government ensure that farmer will be protect against corporates
modi be arrogance ego and stupidity will lead to his downfall give the unequivocal resolve of the heroic farmer to stay even 4 year if need be or until the draconian new farm law be withdraw in full his decision to corporatize farming be his big political mistake he have misjudge and underestimate the resolve of the farmer typical of an ignoramus act to be wise and hence do not relent the 58 farmer population be a huge vote bank that can very easily vote him out of power in the national election in 2024 with these law pass mainly for his 2 industrialist crony business front of modi will eventually corner the majority of the country crop forcibly at low rate thereby enslave the farmer force them to sell lease their land to these business after break their back financially usher in large scale commercial farming where they will be force to work for a living these company have 2 year ago in utter secrecy start to build gigantic granary and also lay railway line near farm community for access and cheap transport well before these law be pass which obviously mean they be privy to the information
if msps determine by the government and enforce by a law be high than the prevailing rate at the international market the agriculture produce from india will become costlier

jai hind jai bharat farmer power
know the fact the minimum support price msp be not go away the guy protest be middle men who have make a killing by buy low from farmer and sell it high at the mandi the only option the farmer have be to only sell at the mandi now with the government be provide other option to sell in the open market or the mandi whichever they prefer thus give the farmer multiple option the only one who be gon na loose out in the process be the middle men not to mention the protest also have a political link just say

they win to keep the farmer and theie life like same a 70 year they be live
they will not even leave farmer until they bring farm sector to ground like gdp automobile politics
unless it be an emergency like war or natural disaster the commodity can be hoard and create an artificial demand to help monopoly corporates i think the farmer be smart that be why they be fight for their good future farm sector be heavily dependent on climate condition and environment they know it
sad day for indian politics do not elect bjp for such spineless decision caa then and farm law now some protester should not dictate some bill
shameful that kisantractortally do not remain peaceful
we stand with farmer
the thing be that still the mandis be not in reach of farmer
the only reason to dismiss those law be upcoming election they might bring them back again ji desh ka kisan 1 sal se sadak par hai u desh mai democracy ki bat krna ek mjaak hai
do not help farmer in future
thank you for your presentation on the repeal of the farm law and the present problem farmer face central government should facilitate extension study and train for farmer so that they can learn about the item you have cover in this presentation central and local government should create avenue where the farmer can sell their product locally for appropriate price this will give the consumer the opportunity to avail fresh farm product and the farmer will get fair price for their product the government should also make funding and technology available to the farmer at all level so that they can have access to appropriate climate control storage young people should also step in to social entrepreneurial role to solve these problem for the farmer

2 if there be no trader leave in apmcs will the govt be still there to buy the product at msp
1 this protest be limit to 1 state of india ie punjab political party have manage to spread it around delhi but people far from delhi be not interested
it be the farmer honesty and integrity versus the government be lie and dishonesty
there be a case to be make against the notion that farmer will increase price when demand increase in the current apmc situation apmc have to buy the product but there be no such binding on the private player it have so happen in the past that private company decline to buy from farmer cause their produce to perish
it be not kisan be mistake it be government mistake that they take decision but do not preach what exactly the bill be and therefore the bicholis and opposition take advantage by give wrong knowledge to the real kisan and a we know that kisan mostly be uneducated so they come under the influence of wrong people still government have a chance go and teach them what really the act be
finally understood why farmer be protest could you please explain why do the govt pass the bill
a big salute to our indian farmer
despite every effort to suppress their movement they protest with the same tenacity and patience in the end their non violent non cooperation result in the government be surrender be suppose to be description of freedom fighter in the 40 while gandhi lead them it also apply to all those farmer that be relentless and succeed this time without a gandhi lead them tho

u do not know any of the truth behind these form law which be regulate to make the farmer life well especially small farmer bt behind the protest there be the farmer of punjab and contiguous state of hariyana and some part of uttar pradesh basically these farmer be quite rich and do not want to negotiate their income to small farmer of all over the india who be gon na benefit ed by those law however all over the country these law be welcome across all the state except these state mention so do not put the one side story in your news cover and do not try to slur the great india in international medium if it all have to happen protest so why it be not countrywide except some handful area if the farm law be so oppressive then it have to be protest country wide bt it do not happen

the 2nd bill will give the farmer a chance to sell outside mandis but this do not necessarily mean that the govt will try to get out of the agriculture business you can definitely sell in mandis too you will just have both the option which be a pretty good deal for the farmer
so what do farmer want if the farmer move out of mandis on their own due to this law then why why would they move out and with 60 year of govt back the farmer be still struggle sorry but this video doesnt explain why the govt be do what it do allegation and imagine stuff doesnt mean journalism

now there be instance farmer th rough their entire produce on road due lack of storage facility huge storage cost
question same way the farmer organize themselves for the protest why cant they step up a a union when it come to bargain the price outside the regulated market
great explanation but majority of farmer in india be small farm owner they have no bargaining power against reliance and the big private player before long the private company will own all the farm land instead of bargain with small time farmer
but if govt be think that to give a parallel ecosystem to sell the crop directly to consumer will remove the hurdle of farmer be life it be also a jumlaa because sell the crop directly to the consumer be not possible without the help of big company big fish

the drop in gdp percentage contribute by agriculture doesnt necessarily mean farmer be suffer it can also mean india be diversify and improve other industry thats a very wrong way to portray the fact
i think indian farmer should wait atleast 1 year and see the result of new farm law then they should decide whether the law be helpful or not
in short the private market other than apmc regulated market should also be bring under taxation and msp should also be fix in private market for farmer
second law allow private player to get farm do on a contract again it be farmer choice to get into contract or not
i appreciate your conclusion on this issue farmer should be justify

if you say that most of the farmer sell their good outside mandi so what be the problem in this reform
seed subsidize fertilizer and pesticide subsidized agriculture loan subsidize 0 income tax until very recently diesel be subsidize just keep farmer in mind confirm msp from government never see government provide more crutch for an industry people be still unhappy
all the explanation be expect to bring some fear of some future case but those case be still valid in current scenario also there be no constructive suggestion to make it perfect it be an effort to oppose any new change with fear monger which affect mostly to the middle man of political party which be more in punjab and haryana that be the reason and leave maoist and khalistanis jihadis and congress use this an opportunity to use this occasion to riot after caa riot
this be not a farmer protest this be the middleman be protest please get your fact right
they be imaginening that in future msp will stop because of direct selling to corporates i imagine that in future robot be farmer
ive watch the video twice i still dont get why the farmer be protest it seem the pro should overweight the con what be i miss

decent video would have appreciate it more if you have cover the so called india against propoganda tweet of indian celebrity if you have cover how right wing be call the entire protest a a khalistani protest from day one how indipendent journalist be get jail for be unbiased

why should only indian farmer have all the fun
you be say that mandi ke andar ek system bn gya tha rate kisan nahi middleman fix krte the to ye btao jb rule aur regulation hone me bawajood mandi ke andar kisan apna haq nhi le pa rhe to ek free market me kese le payenge corporate system me swayam bhagwan to ake baithenge nhi ki wo ane wale time me kisan ko exploit krne ka sunehra moka chor dega mandi system me to fir bhi msp mil jata jbki open market me iski suvidha tk nahi to agar rule and regulation ke bich price fix wala mahol bn skta to kya gurantee open market me esa nahi hoga
falsehood india farm sector have shrink over time this be not true the farming sector have not grow as fast a the service sector or manufacturing but it have still grow that be why it compose a small fraction of gdp later on the attempt to say that slow growth have lead to a rise in debt when that not true either
new bill be good and it should be implement also bill do not restrict apmc there be a base price which govt be give if the farmer be not able to sell and base price should not be low in contract farm also such an agreement be void and the farmer should be compensate
farmer winning
tomorrow modi shah india will say opposition leader can not address political election rally it will will be do in name of maintain peace
to the so called smart people of comment section if the mandi system end in other state that produce foodgrains on large scale the situation of these state will also turn into situation of bihar where there be no mandi no middle mam a you say that exploit the farmer mandi system be abolish in 2006 in bihar after 15 year farmer have not have a favourable market for their produce so some small farmer of bihar migrate to other state
punjab should try bjp for 5 year see if they can come up with a solution every farmer should start natural farming on a small plot of this farm also grow bamboo a fencing
only two state get good number of mandis so it be not feasible in other area of india
salute to the farmer
the new law try to decrease government responsibility but since greed be there in corporation mind they will play game with farmer
vice team it be good to see young people take initiative overall a good report on your next report please spend more time on what be wrong with the law point by point most independent economist include at least one at the world bank say these new law will decrease income of family farmer and increase food price for the consumer they be very cleverly write to concentrate more wealth into the hand of ambani adani be of india it be not capitalism it be cronyism we have already see in the state of bihar where these law be implement at the state level farm revenue have be cut in half imagine when this be implement across all of india over the next decade and competition be obliterate the current system be not perfect but that be not an excuse to take wealth from the middle class and redistribute to the 0 000001 yes that be a real number 17 billionaire in india worth over 5b 1 353 000 000 population for many of these 17 though not all most of their wealth come from massive transfer of indian taxpayer fund through corrupt contract and transfer of indian tax payer own asset for penny on the dollar it do not come from innovation or great business acumen in fact they be stifle innovation and gdp growth china not exactly a model of capitalism or great governance be grow at almost twice the gdp rate when their economy be at 3t these ambani adani type could teach class to the russian oligarch on corruption now they have set their eye on the indian farmer unfortunately for them farmer may have allot less money because it be honest money but they be smart and more resourceful than these so call business tycoon
let be hope the so called farmer may leave the delhi boarder

jai jai sri kishan great victory god be good
you should not call it anti farmer bill
bro one thing you miss be in the price bill it say a farmer can come out of the agreement with a corporate without pay any penalty but a corporate have to pay penalty if it go back on the agreement
every farmer can grow fruit and vegetable in punjab but there be no system and there be huge exploitation a we know there be huge diffrence between buy and sell price of fruit and veggie obviously we all be aware of food inflation in country in short there should be msp and mrp of every commodity if we want to save the nation

hmm to be honest it a win of politician whether they r from bjp or congress etc loss of farmer not a win of farmer
india be already an agriculture surplus nation so the msp be encourage the grow of more wheat and rice than be actually need the storage facility by food corporation of india be already twice their buffer stock they be flood yet farmer expect more grain to be buy regardless of demand also in punjab they get free electricity govt subsidy seed fertiliser etc if one can not be profitable despite such support clearly the business model be unviable india need more manufacturing job and less people in farm 50 work in agriculture yet only contribute 15 of gdp you get pay for value not hard work i dont blame thr farmer i would feel the same in their shoe but the solution lie not in agriculture but create alternative employment we dont need more food we need more nutritious food like vegetable and protein grow not more wheat and rice our appal global hunger index rank attests to that

the entire argument be base on the assumption that govt be abolish msp which be a fake news it be not their in the bill so if at all this bill do anything it give more option to the farmer get more flexibility on top of the exist infrastructure

previously i think modi be not good person now i can surely say he be the great prime minister india ever have all khalistani people know the truth now they begin to fear ha ha ha great
modi ji be last hope i think he have 56 inch ka seena but it seem like he be a coward
this be not a farmer be protest anymore with all those people wave khalistani flag i fear the protest have be hijack by the separatist
madam you eplained it legaly now a a farmer of punjab allow me to explain it at ground level
keral support mandi bachao where be mandi in keral
modi have no shame about how the farmer be sit out in the cold show what sort of a leader he be one who care about no one except himself
punjab be agricultural model in any case be inefficient huge amount of water be waste to grow paddy punjab be climate and soil be not an ideal condition for paddy cultivation in the first place but when you have unlimited free water and now free electricity then you grow anything you feel like because you be not bear the cost this be what large farmer be do they grow paddy and wheat sell it at msp to the mandis and earn huge margin this be a settled pattern of income for them it be simply yield multiply by msp multiply by acreage the large farmer be mostly absentee farmer who use farm labour from bihar and other state while they stay in delhi or even become nris whereas the small farmer be force to wait at the mandi gate sell their produce to the arhatiya agent at whatever price they be give because they have to sell their produce otherwise it will rot and then it will be 100 loss
whoever make this video have no integrity although i agree with part of the video much of this be a blatant lie for one there be no violent crackdown on farmer the video make it look like 100 die in crackdown while in they die due to covid which union wouldnt admit a they believe covid be a govt conspiracy secondly govt never try to do away with msp this be a law to allow for open market that would push the same kind of farm you promote in your video but when you have an agenda to push truth doesnt matter
it be so hard to believe that only a few decade after the indian independence act the government be cruel enough to do this to farmer
just listen the farmer

these ppl support modi when he be work against muslim how the table have turn
jay kishan i love indian farmer soul n heart of our culture n pride
thank you sir for provide in depth clarity about farm law educate and empower farmer should be the first priority otherwise such law and reform will be
more than half of protester be worker of opposition party almost all belongs to punjab state which be be govern by congress party
i be happy to hear this this be a big for farmer over government kangana and godi medium all there mouth be shut farmer stand against like warrior
so basically state govt and some business player be at loose along with consumer so why farmer be protest
i know it be a political game but the history have witness the implementation of law in india do not you think that farmer will be manipulate in the hand of corporates because they will have the power and money
indian medium be godi medium plzz you cover all proper news about farmer and their struggle
what about if apmc get disappear after 4 year where farmer will sell their product to cooperates no way more farmer will suicide
let me give you the counter perspective these three law be what have create the farm sector to grow slowly removal of these law would mean investment in farm infrastructure by private enterprise which will lead to more stable price for farmer as well a consumer and will enable the farm sector to grow fast farmer will have the choice to sell their crop in public or private market public market be riddle with corruption where middleman can take margin up to 80 of farmer be profit private market will allow competition from private buyer which will end the monopoly of middleman lead to good price for farmer
whoever question the farmer today in this pc on teni resignation demand hat off to him for possession of audacity to ask a question which can corner both skm government
i be fully support farmer
vox should have involve some note about electoral bond system introduce by present government it would explain why they be so desperate to implement these anti farmer law
at least we can do this much work for our farmer this will boost their confidence in further movement
this be not complete information you address only some fact which be show this bill be not anti farmer but it be not reality
they be not farmer but bloody antisocial element
national food security policy ke liye govt ko every year million of ton of food grain khareedna pdta hai and ye sub govt apmc ke thru mandi se he khareedti hai govt isiliye mandi ko kabhi haath nahi lga sakti plus apmc be a much need tool ye lie spread hoe raha hai anti govt ideology hai and pura muudda political hai inka farmer se kuch lena dena nahi hai
also something very important that have not be mention here india have what be know a a pds public distribution system where the govt give out important foodstuff such a rice ragi dal etc at subsidized price this scheme not without flaw still ensure india be most vulnerable people can still afford food especially in urban area with hoard limit remove corporates can start offer price much high than msp if only a small amount of rice be grow that season say if there be a price crash which happen often and no sane farmer would then sell to the govt limit the stock they can distribute and since pd be national system the shortfall in rice could be felt by people around the country so the farm law could lead to an increase in hunger and malnutrition especially among india be most oppressed
thank you farmer india will be ever gratefull
rip the farmer who lose their life
i totally understand what modi say from today onwards i will totally not buy anything from rich kisan one state and buy from poor kisan be of every state of india
im not indian but farm for these people be all they know it just not right stick together fight for your right
you do not talk about new farm bill
hi brother appreciate your effort to make a video on this socially relevant issue let me put forward my understanding on this matter basically you be talk about organise v unorganised farmer class practically farm sector be still unorganised in our country right now and it be control by middleman with the help of corrupt politician so the new bill or law be not go to change the scenario secondly base support price be currently benefit less than 6 of farmer in our country and the scenario be not go to change unless farmer opt out of apmc set up thirdly and finally the main drawback of the new bill be discuss be lack of awareness knowledge and expertise of farmer in deal with the marketing of their product outside the region in my understanding we should not underestimate farmer on utilise technology with the help of digital platform they can tackle this and government already start program to educate farmer initial stage there will be some issue but they will get adjusted soon during digital india proposal opposer be tell this drawback but now even the road side vendor be utilising digital platform like upi for business how fresh to home online food delivery group train the fisherman for use technology be also a classical example in this regard
make msp mandatory and legal a law if buyer be give price less than msp then he must go to jail or hang till death this punishment should be write in the law

the next term may see gst petrol diesel cost of grain and anger against farmer
it be setback for farmer development
nothing bad than english speak in an indian accent good luck to the farmer
the assumption that food product price will raise be base on a half baked analysis actually if you cut the corrupt middle men in the exist setup the benefit be two way both for the farmer who will be able to sell directly to their customer with the discount of the corrupt middle men cost so i believe it be profitable for the farmer for sure who know the various option of sale they have and it can benefit the end retail customer as well a they can get the product at cheap price a the cost of corrupt middle men will go retain just the actual transportation cost from source
0 27 only from 2 state punjab and haryana in majority this farm bill be for poor farmer that be why these rich farmer from punjab and haryana get offended and of course u know what they do with redfort on 26th january how farmer protest take violent turn attack police with knife sword 400 get injured many of them can not stand on their foot again
when it come to agriculture and farmer one section of them do not accept the reform great job remain poor now our country can not just remain dependent on agriculture and a pm and his government can not waste their time to make some farmer please

why no talk about those farmer who lose their life for the protest
i be not a bjp supporter in any way but i think this law be a step in the right direction msp applies to only 20 odd crop many farmer stick in a loop of produce the same crop and thus many time govt will end up have too much produce in hand and there be some wto restriction that stop govt from export all of it we be end up with large food wastage let be not jump the gun and declare the new bill be evil
sad this would have be very usefull for poor farmer of up bihar and many other state except some rich farmer in haryana and punjab very sad that people do not support our govt in such a good initiative
one who have read the bill carefully and understand it would never oppose it for welfare of small and marginal farmer very bad decision for farmer future people who r bark here do not even know how farmer be suffer and what agriculture actually be and how much essential thess bill be for them mark my word you will see the consequence of this on farmer life economist r not fool to support the bill but unfortunately we have whatsapp university professor i m not bhakt just read the bill once
nxt time you see indian farmer trend you will have a little idea of what it all mean still he do not disclose the whole situation hijack the protest by pro khalistanis benefit of these law toolkit case and who be responsible for red fort clash disrespect of tiranga

just one clarification the farm share of gdp go down from 51 to 15 be not because of decrease in farmer income but because of increase of service sector and it
open up the market will benefit everybody a in any other field the system will not be same a only deal between farmer and the corporate this will bring more innovation practice and more people and will link with many other business field

i think mandi should be abolish so they can feel the need to go out and see what market actully demand not just produce anything and go to government and say purchase it government should not be obligate to purchase anybody be good we middle class pay tax from our hard earn money and it go directly to corruption loan waiver subsidy

i wonder how the middleman be not too powerful i think they would have do the same thing which the private company could do like snatch all the land since a private company want to stay in the indian and follow law they can not do it against the will of indian government they can kick any company like pubg
look at this it feel that i be a salaried tax payer will have to pay high price for the corporate profit there be no assurance that the corporates will pay the farmer well but i on the other hand will have to pay high for the company revenue
4 why the farmer be not allow to go to court in case of dispute whether they can afford be a different question in case of serious and mass exploitation farmer can group together and try to go to court but limit them to dms level be too much autocracy esp the kind of dm who say break their head you should know in case of dispute they will take money from jio and give resolution only in favor of jio forget justice
good report but you do not mention or deliberately miss an important point wto and usa put pressure on government of india to reduce or abolish msp and subsidy give to indian farmer a under wto law it come under trade distorting practice would love to know your point of view on this
any one with a little bit of research can find out that 83 of indian farmer be have less than 2 acre of land and this msp do 0 benefit to them bcz they do not have volume to take advantage of this scheme on the other hand rich farmer of punjab and haryana have large land holding and enough money to to buy produce from these farmer reap all the benefit of these scheme also if these farm law be so bad why be this so called revolution confine only to 2 state in india along with some part of up
it be even more violent and cruel to subject these farmer and their family to poverty and even low quality of life stop demonize people who be try to upscale their quality of life to decent standard that have long be exploit by capitalism for maximum profit
arrogant bjp think that farmer would back out once meet with brute force but little do they know that these mofos be hard af and they will do anything and everything to protect and fight for their right
this be exactly what happen in hawai the farmer can not sell the crop to anyone other than the corporation with the patent they then fall in debt and be force to sell their land to the corporation these reform be deadly

i always think that rest the land and change crop be well for the nutrient in soil thus keep the land more fertile pesticide that continue to be use have no impact on pest over time thus require more the people ingest the pesticide and crop quality and yield decline there have to be a good solution why be only 2 crop subsidize include more subsidized crop help farmer to grow a large number of different crop would that not help

it be a fact that nobody listen to the farmer who be the ultimate victim of this unfair trading and price fixing process it be also true that the farmer themselves be not united due to person social educational professional and political reason difference and or influence the long term solution to this problem be proper education of the farmer right from the grass root level wherein the farmer will not be teach about the on field farm technique method and process only but also how to be smart intelligent and scientific enough to bargain and negotiate the price of their own produce so that the trader middleman and or the company and or the government can not cheat or fool them this initiative must be take by the government and the farmer should be encourage to not just focus on enhance the quality and quantity of their produce but knowledge and intelligence level as well this be the only solution to not just this problem but any problem all this chaos and drama be happen because of ignorance and a predominant political influence it do not require any effort to mislead misinform and miseducate a helpless needy ignorant impractical and naive person

contract farming be an improper word use to explain the bill soon a it be pronounce it be understood that the purpose be to miss guide and so it be more of spread the propaganda than the actual knowledge contract farm would be right if the entire exercise of farming be under a contract and all service render and cost incur would be payable under the contract

in punjab and haryana most of the farmer do not do kheti labour from up and bihar do their kheti they be simply free that be why they stretch the protest so long it be high time they should get pamper after get free electricity loan waiver income tax waiver etc on the expense of fellow countryman be tax now they want fixed price for their pesticide lace crop they do not want to re innovate themself if any freebie be give to them by govt govt recovers it from tax payer like u so we be pull their weight and still they be ann data they should be deal with stick govt should stop purchase crop on msp from big farmer of punjab haryana and western up

indian farm system be one of the best but only 2 of people get benefit from it imf will always loose in india they cant win battle against farmer
what deeply pain me be the fact that this decision to repel be make on heavy political encumbrance and not on the entirety of the farm law bjp make the mistake of not carry out due diligence with farmer stakeholder in the first place and be very haste with the farm law a much wise and inclusive decision should have be make on a sector like agriculture that contribute over 15 of the country be gdp and employ over 50 of the population directly and indirectly thou i totally agree with good number of the farmer grievance but personally i be in favor of the farm law and sad that it have to go away like this i feel even sadder this law have to be scrap under the political burden and not because of the law itself

2 farmer will have to pay a fee when they sell in mandi just like it be right now but if they choose to sell outside of mandi then they will not get charge anything do not you think that in the long run then the purchaser will take adv of this fact and force farmer to pay just a small hair above net profit that farmer will get if he she decide to sell in mandi and in most case small farmer be not go to return without sell otherwise they d have to cover the cost of two way trip from farm to outside seller
ye dono ne bill ke positive side ko to boht acche se discus kiya sahi hai pr jo loopholes bola usko properly discuss nhi kiya ki kaise contract farm se farmer ka exploitation ho stka hai etc etc exploitation na ho uske liye govt ek committee banayegi ab jo ki ye system naya ho jayega iske loophole turant pta nhi chalange
if the price fall below the suppose msp due to excess supply only large corporation will be able to buy and store the produce no local business will be able to meet the msp price when supply be more than demand when it an open market market need to be decide by market force agricultural economy to wide and too complex for just a few company to manipulate easily some restriction may be necessary and can be bring in at a late time a well depend on how the market evolve many state already have remove the apmc monopoly and allow contract farm there be no such evil in these state karnataka and maharashtra for example msp be not fix for all crop fix msp mean a guaranteed income the farmer produce it irrespective of the demand basically leading to the situation of the indigo farm you mention the land become infertile with the same guaranteed return crop produce look at data from fci how much excess wheat and paddy it procure punjab be already move towards desertification due to intensive farming of paddy wheat or sugarcane the draught prone marathwada region of maharashtra have plenty of sugar industry and farmer try to grow sugarcane my 2 2 cent

both punjab and haryana get the high subsidy in the country with almost 50 off on input include electricity and fertilizer but still the crop produce be sell expensive compare to international price of the same comodity where be competitiveness
it be not a problem of the farmer only rather all the common man will be affect by this law can one simply imagine how hoarding be legalise
if really government want to work for farmer then should work on old bill loop pole i e trader license mafia culture should be stop and so on and should not remove the msp

fully wrong information bihar mein jakar dekho je bill 2006 mein aye the mandi system bnd hoo gya waha maize jo ke 1800 r per quintal hoya that 2006 ke vaad 700 800 per quintal and ikk aur baat wheat and rice v bihar we punjab and haryana mein vikne ke lite aate ha kyoki bihar mein 900 ha aur punjab haryana mein 1900 r wheat and rice je bill lakkaar toh jpunjab and haryana ki vi bihar mein bdlne ki soch the hoo and rhi baat contract farm ki punjab haryana mein phle see hoo rhi ha je kisan sugar mill see contract krta ha lekin bdle mein sugar mill balle aaj v kisan ki payment ni de the 1 1 saal ki payment ni de rhe 22 phle research kro fir video bnao thik ha orr inn bill mein he v likha ha ki kisan kabbi v court ni ja skta sirf sdm tkk ja skta ha orr 22 je cooperate house toh sdm toh apni jeeb mein rakhege
he be actually very right right now only farmer be in pressure just imagine when big people will be able to hold grain they can regulate demand and supply small example that you can test buy pineapple from a fruit shop and then buy cut pineapple from the mall you will actually see the difference in price except for the metro or big city today also medium class people buy daily need thing from small shop a they be cheap trust me abhi toh farmer ki lag rahi hai agar paas hi gaya you will need to pay high price for daily need
farmer life be not comparable in comfort to any other job so put regulation on him be totally unjust
4 licensing system be a way for state government to make large amount of money that be why the state government in punjab 90 produce buy by government be against it a it kill a cash cow
a big majority of farmer be happy that now they can explore new market but ofcourse the middleman shall be loosers there be intelligence report that these protest be fund by enemy country like china pakistan
in the idea of give a neutral view you actually have speak in depth price discovery be very difficult to find in perishable good a production and demand and expense keep on change from time to time and you can not hold your product the best thing would be to create more mandis which will give farmer more place to sell a farmer will not go to a different state to sell only trader will do that government cooperative and investment in cold storage be the way forward however if private company be involve now then cooperative will not form and hoard by private company will happen in big scale american and european agrarian economy be heavily dependent on govt subsidy because of the model that this govt be try to bring kindly talk in dept about the flaw of the present law and mandi system
this would be your contribution to support the farmer
dairy horticulture animal husbandry be not under msp and apmcs we do not have any problem with that why should it be different when it come to grain
and if do not know i let you know that out of 37 state and union territory only farmer of 2 4 state be protest against this
such bill be already implement in america and european country there be no such good result for farmer in those country after these bill debt on farmer increase and sucide rate in america get increased
when the government be favour the farmer you say price will rise and when they be favour u you say the farmer be be repress
we hate modi and bjp
god bless you for your great effort and dedication to create the proof to show reality and truth of kissan andolan it will be a historical documentary about the struggle of indian kissan against the corporate market
there isnt much in they way of an arguement for why these law where bring into existence in the first place dont really expect vox to be objective when their be a left wing narrative to peddle if the farmer get good price they should be allow but they shouldnt expect the taxpayer to fund their inefficienct method the govt be no good but an unregulated market be necessary to bring in much need capital a to your arguement on bihar simpluly deregulate the the market be not enough there isnt much in the way of capital to go into bihar wherw the political setup be significantly more dysfunctional for any sane investor to get involve in the arguement vox peddles be the same reason why india remain where she be for 40 year vox be a product of post 2008 u their fundamentally ideology be distrust towards market regulate or otherwise nothing they have say so far have show otherwise consider how era define these farm law be and the effect it will have in india a bit more objectivity and analysis of the arguements behind the govts rationale wpupd have be appreciate even if that be too much of an ask
this be not just about farmer rn

kejari be fake he be provoke farmer kejari partnership with china to pull down india and indian growth story
i read somewhere that one criticism of these bill be that there be no provision for legal settlement in case of dispute between private company and farmer do you think this be an accurate critique or a politicized issue
although i support the govt but it have big problem with communication skill first they should have consult with farmer union before pass the bill mann ki baat be good thing but you be not listen their concern and suggestion timing be wrong when govt be busy with covid and bengal election
i be son of a farmer from punjab be look for bhakts in comment section but all the 18k comment be ve so thnk for such a support my humble countryman
like the video but i do not understand how you could justify the protest protest against the bill do not make any sense at all unless there be some hidden agenda
an extremely intelligent way to create amend law that sound like they benefit farmer but in fact only line the pocket of big organisation farmer will earn less if they be lucky some big farmer may earn the same consumer will pay more
modi regime be bad than dictatorship independence for punjab be the only solution
bill gate become 1 u farmland owner
kishan aise bol rahe hai jaise wo free mai hame khana de rahe hain ham paisa dete hain to tum apna product bechte ho and abb up election vote hai tab mat dena but wahan jita doge then bologe govt baat nahi man rahe hai aise kaise chalega didid
even if high of achievement neglect agriculture will be a disaster for a nation like ours the farmer be give the high priority but weed out the exploiter
i stand with farmer worldwide pay them fair they be really hardworking decent people
irony of this protect be that indian already get less than half price of crop in government procurement system and punjabi admire canadaian american system most and they have private food market
so sad pm modi intention be good but some people under political agenda be not cooperate these farmer will understand later
bharat mata ki jai god save india indian janta ka jaan ka kimat or aukaat ye hai kisi bhi party ko vote do power to unhi ko milega and after election tmhara aukat alu k purane bore jaisa hoga khali

please support farmer
we support the farmer protest thanks for the informative video
she have explain the thing well but finally end up in a erroneous conclusion definitely there be lot of issue with current apmc system bt the new act be go to worsen the situation far now onwards the farmer need to bargain with more powerful purchaser than early small trader the small medium farmer would not have any bargaining power with big corporates if the intention be to make msp mandatory in every private transaction why do the bill not contain a clause that the price pay to the farmer by the purchaser shall not be less than the notified msp that be why lakh of farmer be on the street
most of urban youth be still unaware about the issue supportfarmers
3 idealy this policy be for whole country but mostly apply in punjab and haryana coz they have the infra of road basic irrigation mandi setup begin so msp policy apply mostly here even today you ll mandis infra on every few km in these two state but not in rest of the state
so gov compromise for few state disregard rest of state in from south and i be a farmer this be really sad we be happy that there will be reform politics fail farmer again
we be all with the farmer i swear i be never go to vote for bjp in my life
do wrong and show off that i do right what a scam many people die lot of wealth damage nice modi ji
nicely explain priya ji thanks for clear all doughts and politics around this farm bill 2020

victory to the farmer struggle
if this be such an evil bill then why be not farmer from other part of the country protest in fact many other farmer more than the one protest on highway and cause civil unrest support the bill
still the farmer have the option to sell their produce in apmc on msp then why farmer go for trader directly who would provide him less price freedom of choice freedom to carry out trade and commerce art 19
it just show that india be not china and we cant just strong arm stuff even if they be the right thing to do i hope this be a lesson for the government to engage in broad consultation before push law through it also show the inherent strength of democracy in india and the strength of popular public movement today i feel very proud of my country even if i support the propose law kudos to the farmer and their resolve that bring the government to this decision thank to the pm for show this flexibility even if it be for the election let heal and move on

sorry farmer maaf karna hamko aap logo k sath normal people nhi join ho rhe hai sorry
2 if there be an msp maintain be it not like subsidize the agro industry itself and subsidy mean artificially allow the industry to operate at low profit or even loss with an msp in place crop can be sell at low price than should be artificially keep the food price inflation in check at a high level of course there be agent aadtis and middle men who take away the lion share in way of commission bribe which make the product pricing not too low either but internationally our raw food price be definitely low which benefit the entire nation in term of cheap food available but also be one important factor in citizen produce more more child drive the population up which we have clearly see since the green revolution and hence put more pressure on the same system that it stand on whilst also make sure of more environmental damage so subsidy do not help they only help protect mediocre pricing keep the same farmer peg back and not able to explore good pricing and bring more agricultural efficiency in place imagine netherlands with the proper use of hydroponics and no subsidy they have be able to become the second large food export nation in the world whilst be small than maharashtra
this andolan be not only for farmer passenger travel in train will also affect by this black law

overall it seem to be a step in the positive direction for the farmer the middleman have a lot to lose the common man may feel the pinch but with private player come into the field the agri sector will get a huge boost this will be very good for the country the private player will only come in the agri sector if they see profit with many private player come in the agri sector price will be decide by demand and supply

when a change government happen one day the party that oppose it today may start sing another tune the big drawback of rule party be their illusion of majority and power the majority be fickle because it be base on first past the post and not 50 vote that be why a forthcoming election generates fear and all the bravado vanishes unfortunately these election be able to influence only negative feeling and convergence to a set of positive feeling be not generate by them consensus building be an art all political party have to learn we have see nearly same idea get support or oppose base on the make up give to their avatar farm law be talk of by congress but they readily join the agitator because they think it can be a way to defeat bjp congress be a clueless party that could not find a robust growth model it be all about appeasement all the time bjp should also realize they be run out of runway and if it can not usher in reform with adequate consensus build approach they will also crash all so call majority government have just about 30 vote only

but sir what about farmer be demand for msp and protesting against
well explain that be the reason why i choose your topic presentation over ravish kumar and arnav bdw my opinion on this topic be like sebi irdai there should be a regulatory body for farmer because no doubt india be major population be farmer a all farmer be not well educate so they will not be able to know the standard price of their produced item so there should be a special television program or news paper article where the regulatory body will publish the price index weekly or monthly this might help the farmer to know the price
i think these 3 bill be not good for farmer government just want to leave their duty to support poor farmer and these bill be mostly support private company indian farmer be not as strong a private company and they can not fight for their right from these company it be govt duty to help and facilitate poor farmer and in india mostly farmer be small farmer

bill will not be take back many farmer organization from pan india have support the bill one state can not dictate whole country
the very first step in bring reform be the bad this bill should have be consult with farmer agricultural people and opposition party
fun fact with the help of bjp govt adani have already construct large storage godown of the country to hoard crop vegetable and inflate and cartelization of price before the bill come out in haryana bihar secondly a railway track in haryana just for his silo be under construction
i think the farmer be afraid of when the cost price of agriculture go down the selling price and govt subsidy be not available
really farmer do not deserve this bill
i come from an india with high rate of farmer suicide
so in short the agriculture sector be in shit and the current govt reform piss off the farmer even more

just like the government be close down small business in america they be try to ruin farmer in punjab they will fail in both place the people will win the official will lose and be oust freehumans
we support farmer
you have explain it right but even there be problem in apmc nexus run in apmc like from which group we have to buy and how much more we have to pay over msp license raj etc for eg if corporate pay 100 kg to farmer instead of 50 60 a msp by govt the farmer be have profit in this scenario why this scenario be be negate kindly elaborate
can not blame the farmer surely 3 law would have help them but the gov steamroll the law make it suspicious sad sad day no one will ever pick this up again water level in punjab be drop sooner or later we will see what mess we be in

more unbiased than anyone else video on farm bill thank you mam
my condolence to all the other farmer in india who get deprive of this reform and will have to continue with same old way while the zamindars big farmer keep take benefit
3 the mandis govt regulate market do give a minimum assured price or minimum support price to farmer who fail to get a good price but this be only valid for rice and wheat this be make a large chunk of farmer all across india to grow only these crop a they would get assured price but this along with excessive push on chemical fertilzers by previos govts in the long run have deplete the soil quality and water table plus also result in the govt buy all excess of these cereal only to rot in the go down storehouse
must share support farmer
pm modi ji you be right but farmer insurance open to kro

overall jo apna conclusion diya bhut acha lagga main punjab se hun and all i believe be the people might not have any problem with the bill but the way it be pass in the sabha and atitude of the goverment toward farmer be not good that be what hurt the people of punjab
really love the way the part where 94 farmer who till today sell their crop at price way less than msp msp for paddy 1925 quintal average selling price 1400 1450 quintal be conviniently ignore by you dr sharma mention it around 6 40 say main sirf un point pr focus krta huun jinko lekr kisaan naraz hain will not take in account why the majority of farmer be not protest i also believe that assure msp be the best way forward for the farmer but give msp to only 6 farmer from majorly punjab and haryana do not do justice for the other 94 i also fear the monopoly of large corporates in buy the produce but it will still be way high than what 94 farmer get today
hard time to farmer
their r very smart inteligent people all around from which some r supporter some r opposition so only request be make a good conclution decesion for the farmer also request every1 to accept it coz option be not completely shut down only some new rule will be add latter on if it will be not workable it will merge itself
for real i support farmer
farmer agitation will prove a final blow to the enemy of democracy
this man will never do a single harm against the nation or it people thatz the trust which no other indian pm gain ever
opposition party have find a tool to obstruct modiji that be jhoota tikait and his farji kisan andolan they fund tikait khalistan force too think to disrupt india and make tikait their mohra tikait announce nakkal sab ka utarunga
ye sab kisaan thori hai khalistaani and farmer cum politician hai
it fake farmer brother
while watch the video only filter and gather the information about the farm bill leave the emotion and opinion out of it you will notice it be nothing to harm rather to facilitate sir have explain well but since it be common in our society to call those who struggle and be miserable a great only as long a they continue to struggle and be miserable yeah then these farm bill wouldnt have support the farmer
the main and important point be miss here that be it will bring a very delicate and intrensic planing in farm instrad of this traditional cultivation without any plan the farmer can change with the market demand and with well plan that will change and modernise the agriculture sector there will be more money with the farmer like those in kerala
but at first big player will pay farmer more than the licenced middle man and let apmc die and then they will pressurise farmer
punjabi farmer or any other farmer for that matter be a source of pride for this nation but this call for repeal all the three act be totally unjustified
assertion bjp be fear to lose up and punjab election
feku want to apologise now but how about the farmer who die during the protest
the big problem i think be regard the reduction in the tax pay to the state government this can be regulate if each trader certify register under govt of india and each agricultural society group which should register themselves to the respective collecter office of their district soon after their formation within a specific time period would pay some amount of tax to the state govt base upon the tariff decide by the regulating authority certainly this tax should be less than the one which be receive from the the mandi system
so obviously farmer wont sell to private company below msp because they be get msp from apmc
minimum support price be a key factor and without that there be absolutely nothing protect the small and medium farmer this video do not go in detail on that topic but have explain most of the other aspect let be face it big company with survive any unexpected event or issue due to climate change but poor farmer will not even with msp there be many struggle to stay afloat if that assurance be not guarantee then it could be like sign a death sentence for many many farmer it will not be long before we have the old system where few wealthy people will own all the land and rest of them will work on that land for wage small independent farmer will not survive even 1 2 bad season and eventually everything will be consolidate into one or two big player and we all know how that work out for poor farmer and general population i think such plan should be implement in a phased manner where government should do this be in small step and not drastically change thing and reduce overview overnight
be the farmer really protest for these no
please dont call them farmer they be khalistanis and naxalites with funding from abroad please investigate and dont speak nonsensical rubbish you be all quick to criticise indian govt
in short if farmer think this be not good so it be not because i think everyone have the right to choose what good for them and what not

modi and shaw either do not understand or be deliberately help the trader and the corporate owner by privatize everything in a corrupt environment punjipatees will become infinitely rich after eliminate the small profession professionals the corruption greed and fear in the system will help in exploit the corporate employee and worker to no limit they will use greed fear reward punishment tactic in hire firing and control salary of their employee they will exploit the self desire for existence to the extent that a phd scientist may be force to work a a clark and a janitor may be hire a his bos people will destroy each other while fight for their existence in order to make their monthly payment for medical vehicle home and retirement insurance house tax state tax federal tax house mortgage vehicle payment and on top of that the fear of lose job break marriage not be able to pay for their child education will remain every second they live a life of slavery that be the future in a corrupt system where politician will have to beg the corporate owner for their existence and the corporate owner will keep on double their wealth every year regardless of what happen this be the extreme picture when corruption fear and greed exists in the society to extreme limit destroy the freedom and democracy of the country wake up rashterwadio it be already too late drop your religious difference and save your childrens future it be in your hand today and farmer be show you by protest and fight for their future existence

in present senerio when 76 percent of farmer want to leave farming and major of indian farmer be near poverty line and non of the previous govt system be able to uplift them then we should give this bill a chance for at least some year may be this bill have some loophole but there could be many thing in positive so yes we should not make it political and should think of farmer only
idiotic expression by expert why farmer of other state be commit suicide
the 94 farmer you be talk about they suffers because of govt do not buy the producer at the accurate time and they be curse to sell to private
really appreciate your way of present all the bill but i would like to point out that gradual weakening of apmcs can hurt the local economy so i would suggest the govt to strengthen the apmcs and then look towards the private enterprise to deal with our farmer so that farmer can have the best of option and let them decide that to whom do they want to sell their produce to apart from that ensure a minimum support price even for the corporates will be a welcome step
sad news punjab farmer grow paddy recklessly and get msp be loot rest of country be taxpayer be money and paddy cultivation far degrades groundwater and be a big environmental problem

liberal would never support communism or any other authoritarian regime so not sure what you have put those two together a a liberal i have to agree that the goal the government be pursue be good the reform will harm allot of people who rely on farm the underlying idea be that small scale farming be unsustainable a they will not be able to compete with big farm corporation the government want be to quickly reform the farming sector with disregard to what will happen to farmer in my opinion the government should create a government farm fund that would issue out loan and grant to farmer for land acquisition and modernization and give out additional subsidy to those farmer that would want to sell their land and offer them financial incentive to change profession the government should also prevent land monopolization by judge corporation that want to enter or increase their hold on the farming market if the reform be do right farm will become large and more modernized and thus will be able to produce more produce that could be sell at cheap price the farmer will earn more the food will be cheap the government should not leave behind those that decide or in a bad case scenario will be force by the market to sell their land these people can start business that provide service for farmer poland go threw similar reform and have do fairly well with it be farm market the government in poland have oversight over the farming industry a provide financial incentive low tax grant and low interest loan to farmer

fir modi destroy economy with note bandi then modi destroy small business with gst now modi try to destroy farmer with these bill with these bill big businessmen like adnany abany tata birla will be able to buy crop at low price because farmer do not have logistics or resource to sell there crop to any one besides these big company and these company will buy at low cost and store the crop to sell it when demand at it peak and these company will export the crop to international market that will cause food shortage in india and common people will suffer the big company benefit from gst become the small could not stay in business and now that business be go to abany and adnany labour class get destroy with note bandi

in india innovation in farming be need we need more cash crop instead of paddy wheat sugarcane in too much quantity
everyone sit at home make money be say bill be right but actually if you look in the past private business have never support farmer and now if government will not take this bill back then the farmer of india will really struggle just see now the msp be around 1800 and farmer get whole 1800 or even more but if we will go and sell our product in private godown where msp be not sure then they will easily give u 800 and when the time will come to give money they can easily say that they dont have money people outside punjab and haryana be just blind in ssr and rhea that they dont even want to know about the bad scenario and be just say that it positive whereas it be positive nowhere government say that the msp would be end then why dont they write this in the bill it a matter of just one line the truth be they just want the businessman to grow the private company will just tell farmer that their be no write proof of msp and will buy the product a they wish and one more thing do any big news channel support farmer or even show their situation no because be government puppet and have hypnotise the people of india in ssr rhea case so that no one could raise his her voice against them
but then again sikh be disproportionately part of this nationwide protest make some pro govt commentator to speculate that this protest have some separatist undertone to it which be sad because true or not it distract from the fact that most indian farmer struggle to get a fair market for their produce
the whole responsibility for this be on modi his arogance and submissive nature towards a few corporates we a indian be see this on daily basis in his deed he work for a few rich indian corporates such a r industry and not for normal indian

so people in punjab and haryana should welcome these reform not just have you in mind but the whole country in mind
not a line on why this be only happen largely in 2 3 state or how avg farming income of bihar actually go up after drop apmc mandis instead show current difference so someone not know would think that be the reason it go protest have some genuine reason like lack of legal option in contract farming deal or have a sudden change instead of gradual transition but just to cover one side of the story bad stuff

government should listen to farmer and take a good decision in favour of farmer not rich buisiness man who after sometime will change rule a per their wish which be not fair salute to farmer
but the reality of the government control mandi be that the poor farmer be usually force to sell at whatever price the broker cartel at the mandi decide msp usually come when government procure directly through the fci etc for perishable item like brinjal lemon etc he be force to sell because he can not take the produce back home
modi should interfere immediately throw cold water on human in a cold weather amount to torture

regard msp we can not compare any electronic or other good wth agricultural product since dayby day it will perish and who will buy any spoiled or perished thing the rice even produce frm a single land will not be of same quality so if there be hundred kg seventy will get good price and for the remain price will be low some time at the time of harvest rain may come or lot of problem which can affect the quality and price more than that since india be a member of wto corporates have a choice to buy low cost food crop frm other country and central govt be spend billion of rupee every year in the agriculture sector through various subsidy and scheme and in the newspaper we can check the price of crop daily pls check

go indias farmer inshaallah you succed in your struggle
a a punjabi i can personally say the problem with the agriculture system have hit our people extremely hard so much so that the big goal of punjabi people be to immigrate to america many other part of india criticize u say we dont stay and build in punjab but rather abandon it a a whole but the problem be much large than stay in and work in punjab many of u find success in america and remain farmer in the state it our culture and we do what can to support those remain in punjab no matter what way you look at it a rough situation there always be massive tension between punjabi and the rest of india so much so that in 1984 a genocide be commit against our people
not a single policy of the bjp govt have work and this farmer be ordinance seem just to target punjab farmer prosperity
3 farmer nowhere in this country have to pay tax in the mandis it the trader who pay the tax for buy there and that mandi tax have be use by punjab and haryana to develop the rural infrastructure difference between a village in punjab haryana and state like bihar where mandis have be abolish be quite evident that mandi tax be quite important for the rural development

free market be advantageous for everyone farmer should not protest
farmer must now take this fight to get msp
if you believe modi and corporates be the villain you will oppose the bill
take the clip from al jazeera and copy paste not a smart move firstly understand all the bill then comment on it educate yourself first
trevor first of all it clear that you dont know your story be superficial and explanation be factually incorrect the minimum support price will continue in the new law the farmer can sell their produce anywhere in india be this the practice with u farmer too the mandis the middleman now can not confine the farmer hence it appear that it be more of affected middleman and anti national anarchist that be in play in the name of farmer
25 state farmer accept farm law but due to 3 state remain state be go to suffer how it become success to farmer
i be proud of india that under the leadership of narendra modi we be progress i have full faith in this govt i listen to this act actually during the loksabha session

if farmer be strong thing will change
the bad thing be that the farmer be basically not much educate so they follow their union leader currently who be basically lapdog of opposition research them what be their main source of income and net worth etc
love your video in general but this one fail to address the key question that it itself raise how can you justify msps for produce that india have in such large surplus the answer be you can not the free market in the end be the best known mechanism to bring price to the reality of the true worth need of the produce hence the price fall without this and with continued subsidization support only unsustainable practice will ensue such a overuse of water burning of field that increase polution in delhi and overuse of fertilizer that you yourself mention not a very balanced video especially due to the fact that many liberal economist support the reform
farm bill 2020 explain with such clarity great vdo
we support narendra modi only leadership
hopefully no more farmer will die on road protest
vox your interpretation of the first act be completely wrong firstly the mandis and msp be not go away they will continue to exist so a farmer if he choose too can continue to sell his produce in the mandis but this amendment allow the farmer again if he choose too to sell his produce directly to the corporation at a price agree upon by both party without have to pay any intermediary price determine by supply and demand if the farmer be not happy with the agreement before sign the contract he can go back to the mandis so at 05 07 when you say player in the regulated market be bind to move out those player be the farmer and bound to move out be them make the conscientious decision to sell directly to the corporation again by there own volition if the mandis be beneficial they will continue to exist if not they will vanish that be how life work
thank you for your time and great effort i like the open market and let market decide the price like we have in stock any one can buy any business trade in nse or bse create more competition let middle man or state government play in the game apmc be great differentiator and msp can be continue to offer by apmc i totally get your point on improve the apmc but it politics and bjp government doesnt back from there regard contract farm it not that bad there be international organisation work with local and that improve the life check apple get involve in mine industry minimum wage child labour issue can be control and make corporate responsible i think let talk about the platform youtube part of the open market we be use we be get benefit from this platform people like me get benefit of your service it a fair play i think essential commodity act i totally agree demand and supply control issue agree with your point but the essential product like onion potato be perishable and cant keep but still apmc can take charge and offer minimum price to farmer and state government could potentially create cooperative society sell i agree one 100 some level of regulation a there be possibility to exploit so create more awareness of apmc and the benefit will be a best way forward it be great show and you should move in to politics and potentially you could contribute more there great work a always some point i like to meet with you and discuss this in more detail
modi ji i stand with you you be go to face the bad kind criticism today by your supporter but i understand there be people anti establishment brigade fund by chinese who just want to adhere the ongoing development in the garb of protest and foe and want unrest in the country for me national integrity come first and modiji i stand with you

thanks modi for help show understand punjabi culture to the world

this victory of farmer be a proof that democracy be still alive in india and it a blow to the govt who thught they could crush this movement like the caa one but our farmer stand day and night in tough condition to witness this day my heart go down for all those farmer who lose their loved one in this fight against the govt jai kisan jai jawan
why be the presenter so one side in her opinion the protest have be go on for 2 year in reality and india have be provoke instigate propagandise the farmer and this protest overall so when you do that how can you not expect this kind of response there be always two side and interestingly the bbc have not be cover this until this kind of response happen up to now it be be the large i m history peaceful protest
such bias opinion be record and present here most of the people who answer be mi inform first of all farmer of punjan and haryana do not represent farmer of entire india secondly law have to be change with change time you can expect law of 1950s to justify financial condition of govt now ask farmer to pay tax and i be fine with everything farmer be do a job just like any other person farmer be not do social service farmer should not be compare to arm force of india
and yes the whole protest be largely baseless anti india anti govt organization be fuel these protest it have very little to do with farm law
the protest be mostly from farmer be union and regional leader who have profit of interest in apmc
so beautifully cover the whole peaceful protest support farmer
apmc msp msp msp apmc msp

thank you for cover this 3 law be take back just because of election in 5 state still not guarantee msp that farmer son be out on bail more than 700 farmer die in that near to 1 year protest
even today in mandis it be mostly the private trader who buy and there be no requirement they have to pay the msp only fci when do procurement offer msp in mandis allow farmer to sell outside mandis only broaden the purchaser base and therefore reduce the vulnerability of farmer to the clutch of adatiyaas of the nearby mandi say govt want to close mandis and do away with msp be baseless this be scare monger the way caa be depict a a tool to disenfranchise muslim citizen logically why will any govt antagonise the farmer who constitute a huge number in our democracy and be always identify for development scheme and anti poverty program likewise contract farming be only make available a a choice if the farmer be worry about contract he do not have to do contract farming and if ever in future farmer come under distress bcos big big buyer would any government sit and watch
still want the farmer to win the con of these law can really destroy farm jay javaan jay kisaan
i dont diagree with your view however why not talk about solution something that make farmer more independent why not upskill them give them more authentic knowledge why not make a processing plant for a couple of village together via fpcs why not demand more infra support limit and credit for fpcs help farmer become self sustainable and skilled why not give the farmer to the power to decide the rate at which they will sell their produce their product why not become independent of chemical farming and promote farmer for pro nature farm not sure why but most people do not want to address thing at the root level why not

this bill have many negative externality and do not serve public good or the interest of the public infact it encourage monopolization of perfectly competitive market which naturally lead to inefficiency and discourage innovation thats why in most country monopoly be illegal not sure why india be step away from free market to a monopolized system
after chide india for not repeal the farm law the west be now try to say why the farm law be necessary
a realistic credit system and a sustained crop insurance system available to farmer that reduce impact of fluctuation

feel so sorry for our farmer
along with farmer 3 bjp worker and 1 journolist also die pg dose not want justice for them
see the hospitality of farmer khaa ke jaana hai
just my opinion legalize msps may distort demand supply curve we be surplus in few crop from domestic consumption pt of view as well a there be no export demand at the price we produce and coz of tradition farmer do not want to change the cultivation pattern a free market price incentivizes farmer for this change whereas msp will inhibit them
direct benefit to jio mart apmc will be finish or will have no worth and so the msp each national asset be on sale right now
why not regulate agriculture with msp let private player to buy atleast at that price govt say msp will still remain but think about it they do not have an obligation to purchase at msp govt can just deny that after private player enter the market just like what have happen in case of bihar since 2006 farmer will have to accept the price quote by pvt player and that be the main concern of this bill
no body trust him or his government even after announcement farmer do not believe him till actual cancellation in parliament
new rule of indian govt would have solve the problem of monoculture in punjab but the opposition political party and farmer themselves be soo shortsighted and they together dig their own grave even big it true education and rationality be must for a society

farmer have always be free to sell their good to anyone anywhere in the country only middle man and trader have restriction on movement of produce to different state a farmer never have such restriction but new bill have no such restriction on corporate private buyer who will buy directly from farmer the anti hoard law do not apply anymore in the new act this be a serious danger for a few year company will pay good price but later there be nothing stop them from force farmer to sell at whatever price they demand and hoard to artificially inflate price for end user these loophole need to be plug immediately
these law would have benefit 95 of farmer in india these rich farmer in punjab and middleman for their selfish motif scuttle this reform
now farmer be protest in punjab but ndtv not show anything regard that i do not see any clip of them why so be it sign of biased but yes no medium be fair we understand

these people who be try malign farmer protest be actually those who strip their pant in front of govt and say huzur tussi great ho tofa kabul karo
absence of any regulation in non apmc mandis another issue that be raise by the farmer be that the propose bill give the preference for corporate interest at the cost of farmer interest
you make an assumption that farmer be get the fair price from the middleman any data to back it up
good explanation thank you in the short run there may be fluctuation in price in the medium to long term like in any business high profit will bring in more player and competitor drive down price in the end government support in the form of subsidy be money public money too less government and more governance should also lead to less tax
india be large rich farmer and middle men protest do not ever call my country poor

very strong opinion against bjp govt but how come they win the election all the time it do not make any sense
this decision be because bjp will lose election in 5 state bjp s arrogance will not win them election many farmer be striking day and night many bite by police farmer kill by bjp mp son in up no action but now this decision be too late what about the pain and suffering of farmer jai kisan

police should help farmer farmer be lifeline for everyone be survival we all do fine without politician
1 ola example your explanation be perfect if we assume that a farmer be go to produce x crop only forever for example tomato forever then he be certainly go to get impacted be an ola driver be very different than be a farmer for buy a car for taxi service you need as low a 3 4 lac and the supply of a taxi car be unlimited but this be not the case with farmland so a farmer be go to cycle his her crop accord to the market demand whereas an ola taxi can only be use a a taxi and it can not be convert into a loading vehicle and then back to a taxi
our farmer be real hero be
ambani own modi like a dog sikh farmer be the patriot here
you explain the situation in case of punjab and haryana farmer but overlook the other wheat and rice grow state and the quality of these crop which govt have to procure be not exportable too good video but it overlook so many other point which we can not overlook if farmer be and farm condition in india have to improve farmer be health use of chemical in farm day by day depleting and polluting water table and farmer grow only few type of crop which bring less price because all be grow same crop plz make another video keep in mind all those aspect too
but i still do not get it it finally boil down to which choice a farmer make right
i think fsp be a great suggestion and should be add to the farm bill
do you even read the farm law do you even know that the people who be protest in india be rich middleman who take commission from small farmer do you know that the law actually prohibit large corporate company from monopolise agriculture industry in india farmer do not have to pay any tax but now the commission agent will have to pay hence this protest by the way only 2 state be protest all the farmer in other state of india be not so i conclude you know nothin jon snow
we win long live farmer unity
these law where excellent but the farmer be not so much educate to understand it thats why some people where able to mislead them
if the corporate reduce the price of good buy from farmer due to so call bad quality will that price be treat a a base price suppose the corporate give r 20 to farmer and if the price go more than 30 govt will interfere how will it be regulate and who would be accountable
both of you should give your money to those farmer they will not protest if nothing beneficial happens then also you two will have to take credit for misinformation to indians so just wait and watch that this bill be beneficial or not
farmer must boycott nihang sikhs a they be chop innocent people

good good go ahead otherwise farmer in india will die so go forward and seal parliament teach the nethajis what be the real condition of farm in india
it be not just the law the people have lose trust in the government why they pass the law in such undemocratic way in the first place why they do not talk to farmer while they be protest for past 2 month in punjab there be a lot of question it be not as simple
we know today we be helpless jobless only farmer can help india these day and people we want less price vetetables food etc plz do not suffer them help them they will help all india

initially i have so much respect for the farmer and their peaceful protest but now they lose it who give them the power to break government property especially the delhi state government bus by show stunt in the tractor secondly the flag symbolize the sikh religion rather than a farmer protest if they be eager to host a flag in red fort they can make the indian farmer logo with it we all know that the indian flag be above all whether you be a common man or a protestor you do not have any right to disobey our flag which be a criminal offense at last one thing i can say they lose the sympathy
the bill be intend for a great good and for let farmer get their fair bit of share by open sale and not restrict to mandis a kind of win win situation however the fear be the gaint company who will offer to buy their good be go to impose law and regulation which will go against the common good of farmer and eventually they will start lose their inheritance on their asset moreover the law will allow third party mass buyer to decide the rate and in due competence farmer will be compel to sell at low price than their profitable price even i think bill be good later on hear multiple agenda and possibility i reside against it
i need some help be center allow both verbal and write contract between farmer n agro company
bjp sarkar me hatya hui to ye pehle bhi ho sakta tha up election or state election aane per hi kyu hua
free khalistan free kashmir love from blochistan pakistan
several of our brother be kill today in an act that show the evil that be grip india though modishah government
and people might be think that these farmer represent the whole country so no way they only represent only their part of issue
because in india other than punjab no other state be protest
you forget to mention that farmer will not decide the sale price a always happen in the past in the end farmer and consumer will be at loss while corporate profit will skyrocket because they have infrastructure and law in their favour to make the artificial demand
also the farmer in punjab can not afford to maintain the already existing storage plant even the electricity bill be 20 lac month in some cold storage plant
i be son of small farmer and i support protest but i promise you none of them gon na return to india they be just show off in foreign country i only respect punjabi who still in india not fake punjabi who flee the punjab

apmc be a flawed system and we have to move forward and protect our farmer and improve their condition to promote agriculture new law be have lot of advantage for farmer and we should support government to pass it no matter which party be rule for political benefit it be be use now which be very sad
the video be very misleading when talk about farmer protest and subtle burn the whole point of this video be make punjab be farmer look like the victim of system but fail to mention that they be protest in delhi to defend that same system there be no crack down on their protest weird how western medium do not call crackdown on canadian protest a crackdown if there be a crackdown in farmer protest than what happen in canada be martial law

this be a big win for the farmer after almost a year of protest and 700 death the government be force to scrap the farm law
prime example of when you give too much power to your government they will turn against you the goverment of india the indian medium along with ambani and adani have turn against the people of india and they will use full force to get there way believe me
ma be with all due respect i think a farmer can sell his produce outside the mandi or in any other state correct me if i m wrong
so you be say that it should not be farmer protest it should be me out there to increase farmer income they buy produce at 1 5 msp and now bring in big company to make farmer earn even more nice but at what cost we be already pay for new office where our leader would cancel winter session just because unki fat rahi hai corona se election be hold during a pandemic because only leader life matter janta jaye bhad me we pay 3000 crore for a tourist spot which be not go to pay for itself before 40 year let alone give profit capitalism baby capitalism

the point of mandi be a death trap be valid but problem be that in mandi govt only purchase weat and rice on msp and the other food item be not include and the transportation expense to sell in mandi be most of the time more expensive than the crop sell make it legal
hurt the farmer how ask u one question we cant answer nirmala sitharaman yes but you also need to get answer right

but well a u be on a mission to side with sikh not for their cause but ur own bad community basically u be a rotten piece who do not like bjp and modi ji and always usher bad word basically jo khud ke liye kuch nahin kar sakta wo duniya aur desh ke liye kya karega

thank u so much for this informative topic about farm bill in easy to understand way after watch this i get more clarification regard this topic
amaze way of explanation very organize but the last bill it be intention be to stock onion while it be in season and sell those while it be off season like monsoon we all be see the price hike of onion in monsoon because of less production in that season this bill will help to compensate that also there be an indirect regulation for the cooperates that be the minimum price if the quotation be less than the minimum price the farmer still have an option to sell their product to the nearby mandi hence an option for get the minimum price be still there for them
the farmer be force to sell only near mandi and that too on fixed price which they never get because of corruption now they can sell to anybody and if no one be interested they can sell back to that mandi they be sell for year
ca not there be a option to directly invest in farmer produce like to sign a deal with them and then invest half of the spending involve from crop of the seed to harvesting and then divide the profit or loss with the farmer

empower state farmer commission rather than opt for heavy centralisation the emphasis should be on empower farmer through state farmer commission recommend by the national commission for farmer to bring about a speedy government response to issue

you can not make msp legal if you do then middle class will be harrass by farmer and retailer because when government say in first bill that you can sell your good outside apmc and in other state then they have to charge for transportation and it very much depend on inflation supply and purchase power and oil price you cant make msp legal because those all factor play very much important role to keep the price low or high so if you be produce good and maharashtra and you want to sell that in delhi then transportation price sill play important role and price will e increase also when farmer be do contract farm they be basically make contract of good which they produce not a land

study iq mahipal video on farm bill be best
bjp govt remove onion garlic in necessary food list and they destroy local trader be local trader be also indian
and no one want to know why these farmer be get hit
the analysis be one side the new bill only provide for additional opportunity for the farmer this in no way remove obliterate apmcs apmcs till today have no competition because the farmer be force to sell there and the trader in the apmcs could cartelise against farmer when the consumer purchase from any shop that he wish why not make available the same benefit to farmer the decision be for farmer to take on where to sell the apmcs may sense competition offer them a good rate and hence may have a chance to improve their relevance currently farmer get about 30 of the value pay by the consumer if the same be at 50 the farmer income would go up more than 100 consider input and other cost the apmc act modification and removal of restriction have be earlier push by the congress government also in fact most of the state have adopt major apmc reform in fact state like kerala have no apmc and there the farmer get relatively good return for their produce a compare to other state about 50 of the value pay by the consumer also the congress manifesto of 2019 specifically mention removal of apmc restriction this current drama be only poltically motivate good return for farmer without disturb the price pay by the consumer can only happen by bring about efficiency and transparency in the market mechanism in any case this be only an additional opportunity for farmer which be upto the farmer to take a decision on whether to make use of or not
we be stand with farmer

modi ji show utter humility and greatness you have to read between the line of his short speech
violent sit on street for two month and we farmer be violent change ur stupid title
u say mutually agree price but it will not happen corporates will exploit farmer because farmer can not reach whole country to sell their crop produce they also can not keep it to them because it give them a living so exploitation will occur and if hoarding occurs whole country will suffer so everybody should go to delhi to join farmer

to be honest this be one of the most perplexed topic on youtube every channel fail to explain it smoothly only your explaination be above the standard thank you very much mam i subscribe your channel after get clearance of farmer bill thank you
i understand that every law be not perfect but do not mean that you will only show dark side in long term it will benefit farmer and country
i appreciate vox medium to create video outside of their expertise but i will have to say that you understand the situation so less buy show current bunch of graph do not show the exact picture take the example of farmer income graph punjab haryana farmer be already rich because this be the two state be green revolution take place not the whole country a for bihar it farmer be very poor from begin a it be one of the backward state but from last from 2005 farming be grow in bihar with 10 15 more than national avg 2 3 infact it stale or even decline in punjab and haryana another point farmer in punjab and haryana generally and majorly grows wheat and paddy bcuz of msp in cycle in vast surplus a govt have to buy from them which be ultimately store and waste they be loose their entrepreneurship a they have now become to much comfortable with the arrangement other state have already dilute lot this in their own way which motivate them to grow a wide variety of crop beyond traditional wheat paddy cotton which indeed help the land and environment too
finally someone speak on this thanku for support farmer
stand saport to farmer we can not live without farmer
excellent explanation very many thanks i will forward to my contact a many do not know what be go on why be the government not listen to the farmer demand and repeal the farmer law farmer have be suffer for over a month in cold wet weather in the street and government be not agree to their demand why why

strict implication of msp in contract farming
agar msp aur farmer ko complain karne ka power ke sath aate to aisa nhi hota
we support farmer
modi ji please make a strategy by imply these law in a new bill it should not be direct it should be hide in facade statement
those who support someone like you than think why india be develop
if farmer want to continue poor ready to be exploit by middleman and landlord let them be who be govt to help them after all it show a mindset of slavery feudalism among indian farmer
ahhh so to let all the people know about these bill out of 28 state in india only punjab and half of haryana be effectively oppose the bill sikhs in punjab middleman exploit the actual mostly small or farmer with less than 2 acre of land farmer by buy from them at almost 1 10 of the actual crop price they then themselves sell to the pvt corporates and earn huge profit a evident from their posh car while the actual farmer be commit suicide now the govt have say the farmer can sell directly to the pvt or international market or wherever they see profit the fake news have be spread about what if tomorrow pvt corporates pinch the poor famers i mean really you guy have be ponching them since decade and the farmer can sell to the middleman if he want the old system still exist vice news a always dont show the complete picture
this bring a tear to my eye see the resilience in our farmer
here in this bill loophole be legal affair which a normal can not withstand with cooperates so let govt take a necessary solution to make farmer tense free on legal issue rest will work
now election corner our leader see no one support on 3 law to bring back vote
if pm make repeal the law early election result wil not be like the present
why he focus on only those issue in which farmer be angry and not those which be benefit for farmer
some point of that aspirant be good regard to 3 law mean national commodity act the encouragement to hoarding be not good for market as well he also explain the role of suprim court but he be perfectly accurate because the law making be 5 the sector it come under the policy making and come under highly intelligent community mean cabinet secretary of parliament assist to cabinet minister in law making and i think they not totally wrong because i be also the son of farmer from maharashtra
all farmer welcome it except these two with political opponent and it be quiet interest on the part of opponent party since they be the sponsor of these policy what do you say
corporate for suststaiment have to make profit if the buerocrcy be good food corporation can solve problem burocrcye be bad than corporate 40 percent of produce collect be waste how about have platform run by farmer to sell their produce profitably let government give logistics at susidised rate

support every one farmer
humm i mean the problem be not with the act or the government the problem be the private company use there act and exploit farmer maybe we can do something to limit these company but sill farmer be in a good place after these act everything come at a cost
the small farmer still struggle the big farmer and the middle man win please we need to calculate transport cost and establishment cost as well when we take about buy and sell cost i know it be less for the farmer but who will be ready to take the loss i be not against but still i believe we have to redefine farmer law to help them for betterment
a a white guy living in surrey canada no farmer no food i support indian farmer

1 why can not farmer form a similar cartel a trader to control the price at which to sell to the trader at least this should be possible with the new farming bill
i would have love to find out how this impact the other farmer not just from the north indian state for example in my hometown the farmer sell coconut to the co operative society and they get pay around r 10 per coconut while it be sell for rs 35 each here in the city the pricing be even bad for vegetable all of this while they be plague with issue like no labour no water flood obviously i can not rely on the regional medium right now because we be have our own drug mafia episode go around to cover up whatever it be that be happen here

kissan ektha zindabad this be big failure of modi and shah government jago india jago bjp ko bagao

but once the mandi system be destroy the farmer will be at the mercy of the private sector without any minimum support price
totally concocted story from everywhere absolute disregard for the farmer politics only the opposition have no clue on how to oppose a popular govt
thanks to think about farmer
the minimum support price be increase high than international price and no exporter be
path be be lay for big company like pepsico reliance etc to take huge agricultural produce for their product soon we wont be able to buy potato or basic food at regular price farmer will earn what they be earn now but common man will buy burger instead of make their own home food at high price transformation of india into u

it a high time to support farmer they be fight for our survival and we should be ashamed of ourselves if we be not do anything to support farmer protest
an year long battle ordeal of kisan against the blind deaf rule class will go a long way in the history of work class of the country
no doubt why indian farmer still poor and they need revolutionary change
we support farmer protest
many people and farmer believe new farm law provide incentive to private sector to get involve in farm sector they can directly buy from farmer and hold inventor people have fear that big corporate will exploit farmer a they always think for profit new farm law not mention anywhere that it remove msp but people believe that msp and govt mandi will eventually dissolve in future due to competition from private sector this will give monopoly to private sector in farm sector
138 crore people of indian be eat daily food because of farmer day night effort and hardship should the pm and cm be sensible to that no concern by government so far
actual yadavji maiaap key vichharoo se 100 sahmat hu today be our victory day i will remember it for life time jai kisan
wait why be it only punjabi farmer protest i m from south africa not sure about the sentiment throughout the large picture of india which be a massive country by all mean look like they be only against the change it seem
hence none of the above amendment will give rise to any adverse effect on farmer earn
vox miss out on the fact that only farmer from two state be really protest also i definitely agree that government oversight be require the problem in todays agriculture market be the presence of too many middle men in the first place
all the people in the world rely on a farmer to fee them we should support the farmer
but oru doubt vannu apmc state govt aanu regulte cheyunath engil athu sate list il varunna karyam aayrikile so athu enganyaa central govt union list pole treat cheyunathe even if concurrent list il aanegil polum athu majority of state support vendathe ale can you explain

4 those protest farmer union have demand similar reform in past and support political party promise those reform however when a right wing government have bring the same reform they have problem in short they do not have problem with the reform but the person who bring the reform
well do sikh farmer fight against evil devil modi government
many small farmer can come together and sell anywhere act will allow for storage not black marketing if you do not allow trader to store how will they transport their procurement and give good price such economy of scale will control inflation if for some reason farmer be not able to produce minimum require quality they can sell at msp through apmc what be the issue bill no where say msp will be take back it be all base on agar aisa hua to vaisa hua to hypothetical scenario he be talk about lb reform but he be forget his own leftist people be against those reform leave be a foreign ideology which have just give naksalvaad to this country nothing progressive
tl dr the farmer be mad because with these new bill their farm will be compete directly against global corporate agriculture their farm will be sell for survival a price fall so low they can not compete the former farmer will be force to urban area this be a vision from the west it be almost completely finish here
i will not talk about anything regard this topic however the quote no one be more patient than farmer really hit differently
it be only 2 state punjab and haryana that be protest the state government will be loose out on mandi tax collection and hence they have be most vocal to protest
the national medium be not broadcast the farmer protest in a proper way
hence prove muscle and money always win the amount of money pump in for farmer protest be beyond imagination
they be not argue on the law which be most awaited and be good for people and farmer in general
2 we dont need so much of buffer rice and wheat this colossal buffer have result from forceful procurement at msp price which be vague and not market derive
buddy trevor we be concern about our farmer but think about the statistic you read 50 of indian population responsible for 15 of indian gdp dont you think the agro base sector require reform
listen to our farmer they be feed u
1 the so called indian govt be crackdown be aim at only those who be be responsible for jan 26th be violence at on country be national heritage monument along with brutal attack on unarmed police personnel on duty that fateful day not on farmer hence criminal investigation by delhi police govt never do nor have stop farmer from their peaceful protest the very reason u can still see them on the road continue with their protest btw the option or rather the door of negotiation have always be wide open for these very farmer
i watch youtube co i be tire of godi medium on tv but this very channel be loose my hope on youtube aswell cos almost all the video of this channel be all talk about the pro side of govt and not con but i would really appreciate this if this channel make a video on the present bad gdp crash in india
i be a regular follower of this channel but i must tell you now that in the political matter of india vox must take view of indian outside delhi because everytime you post a video on indian political crisis eg this farm law and ealier caa law you represent a view that most of the indian do not believe or it would be good to say hate by indian therefore i want to request you to please take view of truely indian national with domicial outside delhi and ncr region because their be a group of elite with their ideology that represent and show what you be show presently

in punjab we sell our paddy wheat at msp near about rs1900 where a in bihar they already apply these bill so bihar farmer sell there paddy below msp like 900 1000 1100 near about half price of msp because apmc be not there govt dont buy there crop
previously the farmer do not have the right to their crop to anyone outside the farmer market of that region
good explanation one thing though agar govt 1st bill mey msp daal dgi to baat to wahi ghum kar aajayegi matlab agar kisi ko msp key bina private company sey 50 r per kg par wheat mil rha hai or agar govt msp daal degi let say 25 r per kg to wo jo private company hai wo extra 25 r kyu degi wo to msp key around hi buy karney ki koshish karegi
i be just wait for a day when you will sit oposite to the crupt of india modi and slap him with your question
expect from a tribal country a repeal that will keep people poor forever congratulation india

msp can not force anyone to buy the crop at first place if price be not suitable one can always reject the buying proposition thus kill all the profit of the farmer
ironically be that people will forget this incident before election keep voting bjp for few money in the name of cow
why be farmer protest then they be give more freedom to do business we people should be worry a the price would fluctuate accord to the wish of these people all they need to learn be how to deal with trader which be basic business profit or loss be the gamble which farmer should take how long can the government spoon feed protect the farmer from all kind of trade deal it be be a long time since agriculture in the country have find it place it should venture in diverse way now we need to move to the next stage of business someday i personally feel it be a good initiative now be the right time to make a move farmer be simply afraid of the risk of lose hold of the business the government can educate them about the legal work and protect them in case of injustice business be something farmer ought to learn

bro you be so biased first you never bother to tell your viewer that contract farming have be widely prevalent in india for quite sometime now seasonal fruit like mango and apple to potato and gherkin to name a few for example a potato farmer start farm base on verbal assurance of lay or uncle chip now if during next harvesting season those potato chip manufacturer do not stick to their assurance to buy farmer be potato he lose entire season earn also those potato grow for chip manufacturer can not be sell through regular mandis a the quality of potato be different from those use for domestic consumption the farmer go into debt commits suicide the new farm law give a legal validity to contract farm and under the new legal framework the farmer can seek justice under the law

good presentation but would request you to come up with the current process of procure the farm produce with the ground reality in mind the bargaining power or price tactic of the corporates and then analyze whether the current farm bill be address those concern or difficulty another point to keep in mind be the majority of the farmer i would say 95 of the farmer do not come under the category of large farmer and be struggle in the day to day live another part of the bill be in relation to farmer can challenge the legal contract only upto the sdm level also in case of any advance to farmer would be settle through land revenue act

i feel for the farmer and admire their resolve to protest at the same time india need serious farm reform most country have modernize farming with high productivity but india be still stick in the past a you mention 600 million people farm in a land much small than the u tell you how inefficient thing be in india too many handout and poor policy have keep this go land degradation be also a problem i just wish the government have do a good job of discuss with the farmer and get their buy in to transition to a more productive future the heavy hand and poorly think out approach be not a good way to go
in this hyper politicise world it be not surprising that a major reform by a popular majoritarion government will have such a response india be a democracy and everybody have a right to protest when an unfavorable law be thrust upon an individual or community which bring me to an important point that be miss in this video be this law so bad there be only a certain faction of farmer affect by it or why be not there protest in other part of india to this scale

man some indian be gon na get so butthurt see this video both pro farmer and pro government
if govt really want to improve the condition of farmer then why not it increase the price of msp and make it a legal right
since when do a free market become a bad thing farmer in india shy away from grow organic produce and choose to grow sub standard gmo crop because of msp since they know the quality be of no relevance any quality be support by the government promise minimum support price a free market lead to competition amongst producer well investment in product which be relevant to market demand take the example of avocado across the world sustainable profitability for producer and also good quality product at a good price for the consumer a product like rice can not be monopolize by a large corporate because if that be true then amul have already monopolize the milk industry in india be the milk producer get fair value for their product yes because if amul will not pay the local producer a fair price someone else will or the milk producer will sell directly to the customer which they do even now the farmer protest be base on fear mongering and unfortunately a small percentage of educated class be also stand in their support out of confirmation bias just because it give them an opportunity to reaffirm their hate towards a political ideology

it would be in the benefit of farmer if they sell their land to someone if farming be so unsustainable for them it be like if worker in a factory want to open a factory even if he have to take loan for them

after read comment i understand that farmer sorry so call farmer be fool the 750 protester sacrifice themselves to repeal these bill why
except the proposal be design to provide much need reform to an archaic industry it be easy to focus on one side of the story but many of the protestors be wealthy punjab farmer that have benefit from the subsidy that be available under the current system
why do modi apologize do the bjp party know that these law be not good for the farmer

master stroke for punjab election haha
the video give contradictory statement at one place you say that only 6 percent farmer benefit from msp while at another place you seem to worry about impact of probable removal of msp on farmer be income government have categorically say that apmc and msp will be retain hence a farmer have now the freedom to choose either apmc msp or free market a you say msp be only applicable for 22 item if the free market or contract farm with a private firm be not offer sufficient amount the farmer can turn towards msp all private player be not predator please see the e choupal system of itc how much time a hoarder can keep potato and tomato your solution of improve the apmc system be naive kindly tell me any place in india where you have a efficient bureaucracy there may be some individual bureaucrat who be efficient but these be isolated case i think these bill may be a game changer similar to the reform of 91 protest be politically motivated congress include this in their manifesto but now protest a they do not want to cede further space to bjp i think farmer should form a group in a village or may be in a block this may give them more bargaining power against the corporates collective effort may give them more economic power also so that they can employ a legal expert while sign contract please see video by shekhar gupta in the print
respect farmer
my only concern be tenancy must be totally abolished centre or state must have no control over farmer except on nnot allow the land to be untilled farmer must not sell agricultural land to non agriculturist it can be sell only for agricultural purpose

human right the treatment of the peaceful protestors have turn into a human right violation the bjp government have refuse to grant repeal to the law they be simply outline their usefulness article 19 of indian constitution state freedom of speech and expression
this require a little more work to be honest the truth of the matter be that no state be look to challenge this in the court the protest have remain localise to a few state the water table in punjab and haryana have be decline because of the skewed prod of water guzzle crop which we be anyway deal in surplus etc
i just know farmer in my village be happy with the law apmc mandies be thug and exploit farmer

main thing be that farmer be not ready to hear at all so gov also should not introduce any reform for these fool there be clearly write in bill no land of farmer will be take and if farmer do not agree with corporates to sell there produce then do not sell and anyway i think in open market without trade farmer can sell at a good price and it not that farmer be not get msp they be get more msp a compare to 2014 so i think we must support farm bill
it late already pm sir a lot of kisaan have die already and others suffer a lot because of your deaf and blind role for month after month now be the time to pay some tribute to the shaheed kisaan who lose their life for your brutal treatment through law and order team it be clear that saffron government have understand the bitter truth that they be go to lose in the come election due to torment of kisaan so they become scared and repeal the black law hat off to our beloved farmer and their andolon

bjp only all over india
thank you for speak about the farmer protest really appreciate
i have no word to express my respect n gratitude for farmer and also to schoopwoop for show u the reality be an agri student from punjab i can understand their demand agriculture be backbone of economy n the only field that have show positive growth during these time they be farmer not terrorist dont torture them like that
a before farmer win congrats guy and shiva
in india it have become evident that govt support only rich business tycoon like ambani nirav modi vijay mallaya etc india have one rule for rich politician and another rule for middle class poor rich will become richer in whatever pandemic situation or recession
well explain but which farmer have wearhouse it be middleman who stockpile farmer need imidiate money to sow for next season and 85 farmer be small and marginal
the main problem in all of this be the shrewd mind of each and everyone of u or atleast most of u people find out loophole or other way to exploit even in old bill and will find way to exploit even in new bill like for example the case of starbucks they offer good value in contract farm so it a win win for both corporate and farmer since the farmer then give them good quality produce in india they will do contract farming and since there be no msp regulation in new bill the person buying will exploit the farmer in one way or other there be already many loop hole in the bill and i think it be impossible to perfectly draft a universally correct bill all this because when each one of u be selfish and want maximum for self corruption and exploitation will happen it be a sad truth and i think this will not bring any change infact in the long run the corporates will exploit farmer
be from farmer background and currently a practice lawyer i can definitely say that these farm bill have the power to revolutionize the entire farming industry it will definitely be helpful in advance the farming industry we should have open mindset towards these bill
farm law be the big opportunity for farmer which they mistake and force the government to take back the decision i still believe that they be good for farmer and government should make it voluntary

6 best earn farmer in india haryana punjab n they enjoy msp haryana punjab be very low when it come to suicide which be most in maharashtra then why do government want to reform state which be do good instead should reform worst effect state like bihar maharashtra
5 govt will now remove cereal and pulse from essential list so that they can enjoy the market rate at the same time there be a chance of hoard the stock by farmer and corporates and hike the price for avoid that govt will make sure that any of these crop price do not increase by more than 100 and 50 in one year or will take the average in past 5 year for perishable and non perishable crop respectively and bring them back into essential for 6 month and review it time to time
free khalistan and kashmiri please indian stop kill them
so basically jo paisa beech me chale jaate hai vo kam kiye hai aur farmer ke profit ke baare me socha hai bill be in favour of anti hoard anti price rise so farmer aur consumer ease ko ye bill favour karta hai
coz this be propoganda run by farmer union these union have destroy small farmer to great extent

current msp be very low amount only that produce which be not edible to eat be sell there it be also restrict to few item most farmer get more than that amount 94 a per the survey you infer that 94 farmer get low amount of msp which be wrong also you say there can be scenario when control of corporates can take over but apmc would still be there for farmer to sell and also they can sell to direct vendor plus india be big market where monopoly like wallmart amazon and uber will not happen a in america govt control price on sell and buy will undermine the reform which it be try to bring in agriculture sector we have to trust on farmer and that there would be many player with healthy competition for buyer and seller to get good deal

your view on farmer if be not able to sell through trader then they can sell it on msp be not right procurement under msp only happen through procurement agency if govt decides to open stall within apmc most often procurement do not take place under msp because govt may not have allocate fund for this or they do it in certain mandies with certain quantity depend upon financial allocation morever farmer have choice to sell either trader or procurement agency even if both be operate in the market if farmer have no buyer and there be no procurement in msp in that mandi they have to take their produce home or other mandi
please bring more video from farmer protest
even after independence in our own country farmer have to face a lot and sacrifice a lot still they never leave their duty and provide what they can it be government responsibility to respect them if it be same then we be still not independent country
i agree to many point you make but msp be a double edged sword many corporates will use the msp too instead of that be the minimum price it will become the maximum price since corporates will be force to pay that many such point
if the farmer can utilise the good factor properly it be v fine but my question be why the govt get it pass without have proper session of thorough discussion in parliament

even though govt announces msp for 23 commodity the crop that be mostly sell at msp minimum support price be wheat and paddy if government be to purchase all the 23 commodity produce at msp then even the entire budget revenue of india will not be enough to procure all the produce
not a single medium of the country talk about our country talk only about the problem of pakistan because modi be afraid that the channel should be shut down

after watch this i certainly know that common people have so much little knowledge of the bill and why farmer be protest it it be like yeah farmer be ask for something and government be deny that also the farming sector be not that much role in our gdp but it straightly provide u with food and contribute a lot in employment the bill be simply to kill the mediator and control the farmer a reliance and big corporate house want to enter into the retail chain system and for that they want to produce packed everything at cheap price it be good but it certainly kill a lof of current employment and uncertainty to farmer the corporates buy straight from the farmer and there be a big chance that they try to dupe farmer to stretch their profit a they get all the knowledge power and money it will make some farmer happy also as long a they be comply with the corporates on the quality and price corporate buy big and store it to late produce that good for a long period of time example you could get tomato at very cheap price when it be produce in abundance process that to ketchup and sell it at a high cost with more shelf life we need to eventually move to that stage a right now the product be not properly be stock and a lot of reliable good be destroy but we government could solve it via prove good storage facility but no government want to remove their hand from this and hand it to corporates anyway this bill sound good just for the people who willing to purchase a tomato can pure than fresh tomato rest it be not that great for farmer and people who buy fresh

good video but lack few thing one farm income be diminish because too many people depend on it even it not profitable question should be what be solution to increase income either reduce too much dependency or increase option in source of income only flaw in argument present by video any regulation or body regulation will always lead to cartel formation this idea of msp be against the very idea of free market economy who will decide msp how will be handle for future price it always supply and demand all those who will decide msp will form a cartel again free market can not work like that agree law should be against corporate monopoly but in agri supply chain sector cant be monopolize like aircraft entry barrier be low a for ola uber i guess technology will always disrupt them after certain point they arnt boeing or airbus that take high entry cost to disrupt msp be not the way it will always cartel the very great idea it want to achieve a product which deserve to have msp mean it doesnt have the right demand in the marker free market economy cant be work like that idea or framework should be for litigation and judicial process in case of such rampant exploitation and price control by corporate solution should that this farm supply chain sector should be multi player market rather than few large player in mix govt can fork policy to restrict monopolization by big firm if more player be in mix farmer will have the best buyer msp be retrogressive way for free economy msp be not the solution
these be terrorist in guise of farmer

2 the price of the commodity even now be not government regulate government intervenes only if the price go too high or too low in order not to let either of the party incur the loss and farmer be not always go to sell or sell at loss only in certain situation they be however government clarify that msp will not be remove which mean the farmer be always protect he can sell in apmc if there be steep fall else he can earn more in the open market

only farm bill video i be able to understand
still y do the farmer have a problem with this bill be it just politics that be run behind the curtain where the farmer be be play a paw
i tolly agree with this video but resons behind why farmer be protest in my opinion be this that a particular farmer in haryana and punjab mostly grow wheat and rice mainly small farmer and when they have to sell their product they will get less price and when they have to buy other product like pulse grams patotes etc they have to pay more a say in the video prises will get increase and
they all be not farmer i know how behave farmer i be also farmer i support that law why the panjab people only reject that law
last year tamil farmer go to delhi and protest for month together nothing happen i expect same for punjabi farmer why because if modi government give in then it be a sign of weakness and bjp can not afford this
in india majority of the farmer have no issue with the new law only 2 state be create problem which have opposition party in power
whereas the middleman trader be from almost same backgroung like farmer so bargain power of a farmer will be lesser in new system he can not even go to court against them a per the new law

be it true sir on the ground base that our farmer be so literate that they can do online trading a you say why not farmer can go to the court government be not willing to do the fast process of government examination but farmer be good trade why should farmer go to the sdm there be much more corruption in z p s recruitment will it assure that farmer could get justice in front of sdm or dm how could farmer manage export while increase the price of petrol diesel if sir you be say that there be an experiment in maharashtra then why there be lot of farmer suicide on the vidhardbha marathwada side why can not farmer flourish rich in maharashtra remove cartel oligopoly or monopoly from apmc there be not the only poor farmer or rich farmer but there be also the problem of poor engineer rich engineer doctor a lawyer in every profession if you may travel all over india or world poor or small farmer can not afford the present apmc system the how can small or poor farmer can afford the new system what be the logic for the new system that the new system can afford to the small or poor farmer you be say that the present situation near about 50 or maximum farmer do not know msp or apmc how could a new system reach towards small or poor farmer if the government willing that farmer have choice for sell the why farmer do not have choice for the judicial system there be also a problem if also choice for judicial then there be also the problem that farmer do not have an expert advocate a compare to the corporate or other powerful purchaser who will purchase the farmer be good obviously middle class or small farmer can not buy or sell farmer be good how can a farmer maintain the same quality of any crop it totally depend on nature like rain humidity coldness etc other natural calamity gujarat model like amul could not fit all over india because there be different atmosphere condition for different region in india why there be so much corruption in f c i why we could not eradicate this corruption why could not our political party make vote bank on core fundamental issue i think it be not the fault of punjab or hariyana be farmer they stick to the msp i think we have to be thankful to harayana punjab be farmer for their contribution to the difficult time of indian citizen why should trader go towards the small or poor farmer the problem remain the same in this system also could i know the solution to these question sir

hello dhruv love your video and the all around perspective i sometimes agree with your point and at time disagree but i still follow you for the knowledge you share in the beginning of the video you mention that it would be difficult for a small farmer to negotiate with big company but i respectfully disagree isnt that an assumption today when i apply or work for a huge organization i negotiate my salary not say it a like for like but farmer have a union and much strong negotiation possibility perhaps a middle ground hybrid approach couldve make it work what if this work well and farmer earn more than msp just share my opinion no offense here thanks for all the work

the government be main approach be to cut off the various middle men link that exists in the country because the supply be reguated at least twice before reach the city or town market the different tier of middle men create their own profit which indeed exploit the original price which be earn by the farmer if the law will cut out these men then most probably farmer can earn good price but the implementation sparkle protest because many of these farmer who be out here protest be themselves part of local trade link or have not clearly understood the government be plan also i personally think it be because the congress political party have fund punjab farmer a punjab be a congress state and the party have influence there to simply defame bjp central government and a you can see the protester be all punjabi and not even a single person can be see who be not punjabi

i have a doubt imagine that the price of one product in kerala be 500 and that of same be 250 in tamilnadu the price of this product be high in kerala due to employee wage and other service cost be more expensive in kerala than tamilnadu so if the farmer of kerala need to get some benefit they should sell it for atleast 500 rupee but the tamilnadu farmer could give the same product in kerala market for 250 rupee in this case the corporates will aim at produce that product in tamilnadu and sell it in kerala with high price say 400 this will be harmful to the farmer in kerala be i right how this new act will address this problem can anyone clarify my doubt please

without minimum price guarantee farm will not survive we have see the price of potato how they fall down when farmer take them in market
thanks buddy great explanation at end what you have mention abt cut margin by corporates have already happen where farmer have agreement with reliance fresh easy day like store and a the produce quantity flood the market they start make excuse that potatoes size should not be that large radish should not be that long so all in all they ask farmer that potatoes size should not be large than some standered ring size here come the margin cut in scenr so where will farmer go in such scenario some helpless farmer have end up throw their produce on road
our farmeres be not empower to produce good or after bill they may not produce expect good accord to contract between corporate farmer indian ariculture still depend on mansoon which be irregular hence farmer may take large loan from corporates which they can not repay a a result farmer may sell their land because of overburden of loan corporate take advantage of this and become land owner illegally corporate miss use of bill and acquire ownership illegal lending of money over land also happen

2 more importantly storage facility near the mandis with extremely affordable price can be run and manage by co operative
i be so baffled that none of the news channel on tv talk about how the repeal of the law might be for his own benefit if this have be do by any other person they would have literally invade their home to ask these question and most importantly i have see multiple protest in my lifetime and never have i ever see the medium so blatantly against one god knkws where this be go
this be more of a regional issue than whole india be stop call farmer of india and project it a a national issue just like butter chicken and naan do not represent indian cuisine punjabi farmer do not represent entire indian farmer where be these people when there be issue in south like tamil farmer protest telangana agitation etc

now let implement it a model be some area if this really successful a a model farmer will definitely understand
these law force farmer to sell their land to sign a contract for appx 15 year with private sector on predicided low price there be also one law to discard exist essential commodity act which will cause inflation price hike for essential crop like wheat and rise also now stock limit be remove for corparates so that they can stock crop and increase the price also now they do not have mandi the place where they can sell appx near to 5 km of their land now they have to sell across state and nobody gon na pay for transportation also they will not be give a fix price can go below msp moreover contractor can take loan on farmer land if they fail to pay farmer will have to pay the loan or else their land will be auction
this be fight in govt and farmer police and army do not interfere
if you want to stay poor not modi even god can not help let the farmer decide their fate now get carry away with fool be the best solution for them a of now but they will repent for their unethical mindset and behaviour later in future

if the govt surrender under pressure and roll back these reform then i guess they should also end the dominance of large farmer they should bring about law that make the agro subsidy available only to farmer with less than 10 lakh income and own less than 5 acre land also msp procurement should be grant only to these farmer i be not suggest any reduction in subsidy or allocation of agricultural budget hike it by another 20 but only give all the benefit to the poor 20 farmer first such that their income double or even treble i could be mistake but be not that the demand of these so call annadataas camping in delhi under the able guidance of shri yogendra yadav

hello we in the usa do this to our society and economy first with the same devastating result occur from 1915 until the 1990 be and still occur today we have the same problem and require the same answer nobody will accept the answer because it mean total economy collapse and reset the polyculture movement be great but it cant price compete without an end to the subsidy and even the current farmer do not want that because it to scary to imagine the intense economic and asset struggle it would cause for them and the temporary food shortage and massive price fluctuation that would ripple for over a generation through the entire population ultimately it would create a massive demand for farmer again if we end subsidy and push any society that do that back to an agricultural economy but india have even less flexibility to do this because if one country in the world usa and china use the method and they can trade freely with your country without tariff and limitation they will undercut your farmer and your society become destitute like the many third world nation unable to subsidize their agriculture because they be to poor and in debt to the imf

well to shorten the case the law of mandi will remain intact the new law be for something outside the mandis if farmer be skilled enough to produce quality food then instead of minimum selling price msp they can sell it to corporates or restaurant through contract like those do in commodity market and the new law be put these corporates and restaurant or any other bidder to pay the farmer and obey the contract so these law be just another option and that do not banish the mandis option

3 cut the role of middleman in sale purchase of agriculture produce so that farmer and consumer get the benefit
2 he fail to mention selling of non msp product in mandis farmer cant sell anywhere outside their mandis so exploitation at it peak
and government be not go to remove mandis they be simply give farmer a choice wether they could sell it in mandis or to private corporation or to simply go in another state to sell it a the current law forbids them to sell their crop in another state of to a person who have not receive a permit from the state government
apmc will loose the monopoly of trade and it location but it will also stop the monoplocy of fci specially in punjab and haryana and one more thing farmer can easily take himself out from the contract anytime without any penalty
if understand correctly what farmer be ask for be a msp for their product so even if you can actually get rice at a low cost government should buy it at an inflated price i totally agree with this demand my only condition be that since everyone who pass graduation do not get same salary government should provide same basic salary for all graduate i think that would be fair

in my opinion market should be further liberalize and the requirement of trade licensing should be abolish but at the same time the government should employ economist to fix a minimum rate and a maximum rate at which farmer and company could transact if both side do not agree on a price outside that range
70 farmer support the reform but sadly they be completely consume in their occupation only the rich faction could afford to protest for an year block highway and not have to worry about their farm

look like in state of punjab and haryana there be great teamwork happen between trader farmer and state government so the center should roll out the present agro reform but allow the various state legislative assembly to give a thumb up or thumb down to it punjab and haryana and some part of up want to continue the current status quo and their state legislature will deliver that to them in all other state of india the agro reform have be very well receive especially those who know what be there in these agro reform
destroy farmer livelihood the country will fall
farmer peace full hei police ne block kiya hei
to summarise nobody be concern with problem of farmer everybody want to gain some brownie point solution of the problem must be focus rather than a new set of law which create another set of problem for the farmer basic question be how can we make the farmer decide at what rate he need to sell his crop produce without any law binding him he get fair price at the same time middle men need to be eliminate state where there be no apmc mandi there be also more apmc must be create for small farmer contract farming be for big or large land holding from where corporates may purchase the produce in nut shell the law do not address the concern for all section state solution will be to enable both system apmc with msp or private dealer at farmer doorstep
it be all do just to shut the mouth of the opposite who be fight against modi on just this farmer reform and right for farmer so modi have play his master stroke

i remember vote on support gmo chem corporation a part of a state legislation bill i know indian farmer be screw by them when i vote but do not realize it be this bad
main reason why it be not good be that private companiea or firm will exploit farmer and govt should find solution or pas resolution against exploitation
the indian medium be control by big corporates who be the ultimate beneficiary of these farm bill if anyone speak out against the government policy they be term anti national and the police arrest them on a sedition charge the colonial british government enact numerous law to keep the indian public frighten and under their control now the so call democratically elect government use these same colonial law to suppress the citizen then what be the point of be an independent nation

some of the burger s boy be just so ignorant about the situation and if we just see the demand of the farmer and the behavior of the government tackle the situation in a doubtful manner talk and at the same time propagate confusion in farmer i think farmer be right and they must block each and every road unless the government listen to their demand
all you say be right i believe but we need to look at a fact that msp can not be guarantee if guarantee forcefully and suppose a crop do not meet standard of a company then no one will buy the crop result in total loss to the farmer who have produce that low quality crop and crop quality be not always in hand of a farmer

i think the problem could have be easily solve if the farmer be willing to talk on a point to point basis and do not directly demand the total deletion of these bill
3 farmer be at the mercy of these middleman to purchase his produce basically exploitation of farmer happen
seem these law will help farmer to get rich
sadly farmer be fool into believe that they should oppose this law while in reality these be the same law which will benefit them in long run
big basket grofers jio mart big baazar more star baazar walmart amazon etc buy from farmer and sell in their store directly which will only benefit them in the long run
i think it bite difficult for example my family be from bihar which be one of the poor state in india these new farm law can literally make our annual income from crop twice like right now my family be cultivate cauliflower and if these farm law be in place we would earn almost 5 6 time on this crop itself but if u r a rich farmer or from a rich state like punjab or haryana then yeah these law can decrease ur income and security quite a lot in simpler term these law giver poor state more opportunity and money and all that money and opportunity be be take from rich state like punjab and harayan thats why farmer of these state be they only one protest it in a way it kinda like socialism
we love and respect modiji
should record in guinness book of world record of this farmer agitation
now you guy know who be a terrorist this video show the true khalistan where pure people live regardless of their religion
if the protection be concrete and give absolute protection to favor the farmer then i will be very happy because anyway the company will have to do their trade and balance so if they be into small trading business they will have to get through for survival in the market this be where the very big company like reliance wallmart come because they could beat any market include mandi because he could be initially buy the good at the best price to keep the monopoly and crash all the big player to dept and then sell and buy the produce at the price he wish later on to the future

the decision of take back farm law can not be judge in a single day or month u must give time to see how thing now develop for farmer just like partition which maybe treat a a fruitful decision during that time but now we all understand how dangerous the decision be for now and for come year also
these punjabi mandis worry that they will loose their fee of 8 5 ce if movement of good allow between district and out of state because farmer group will sell good in out of state mandi if he get more money and less cess charge
observation do you think these law be for farmer they be for hecking buissnesmen farmer do not need to sell crop to corporates which will give them less price with loss they want to sell in mandis with msp minimum supporting price which be cancel in this law corporates need to buy crop to sell on high price they notice that meanwhile in corona outbreak which i do not think exists but that be a huge talk right their so no all the department go in loss but farming department do not go in loss at all but if they want to buy crop from farmer directly they can not cause of previous law and if they buy from mandis tax 6 fucking tax so yeah the new law allow them to buy from farmer directly if you be be over smart and think your point of view pronounce in fat voice yeah bruh but farmer can also sell in mandi if they do not want to sell to corporates me yes but corporates will give high price for first 2 3 year and give greed to farmer to sell to them but then mandis will fail because nobody will sell to them and the corporates will rise low crop price because their will be no option for farmer to sell to another people then farm fail people sell their land to corporates and the the price of crop rise corporates will gain profit long term game bro 2 farmer need to store crop they grow them and sell they do not need to store them huhh but corporates do need to store bet you didn t knew about that do you they store and sell i live in punjab and i notice that many basement type building be be build on highway be sideways think 3 they cant even complain

someone say to use cowdung a fertilizer even a teenager in a farmer family know that
the only con which i can see be farmer generally rotate the crop to keep the soil fertile but if the price for a certain crop be lucrative then farmer may repeatedly go for the same crop which can damage the soil in long run
real farmer only look to sell of their product on fair price to the effort they put
the basic system should remain i have no high hope from privatization because it be money drive the government need to be involve to tell farmer what be best to grow anticipate demand base on data from past and future trend and amount of current stock then a monitoring system that trace journey of a product from seed to plantation to transport to local wholesale market to seller and to kitchen and identify problem and glitches a procurement and compensation system incase bad weather to compensate farmer and purchase commodity overseas or different area or dip into storehouse

apart from 2 state punjab and haryana no other state with farmer be protest ofcourse when status quo be change people will be upset there be real lack of understand what be beneficial a a country and it all about self preservation not wrong but you will not get that in this video
while msp and competition be indeed very good way to reign in the market giant from commit monopoly we need more than that since they will always find loophole but on a short term basis it do solve alot of problem farmer might have which be what they be aim for for example reliance be give people more and more warehouse to use contract farming be provide steady income middleman be be cut off
it be not farmer be protest it be apmc middleman be protest
sir at one place you be say that many farmer have insufficient resource to even transport their produce to mandi s and later in video u say they can sell it anywhere even in different state ur example of farmer of himachal selling in maharashtra

you explain very well about the govt point but where be the farmer be point of view on the bill no discussion about that focus on that
very informative and educative video the presenter be very clear in understand and express it to the viewer in the medium a some one comment this video should be dub in several language especially hindi so that the farmer can directly relate to their problem and the solution i be only hop that the corruption and black money do not come in to play between the apmc and the farmer i hope the govt will consider all the loop hole and plug them before the bill become a legal way for the supply chain it be not clear from the video whether the farmer be protest to enforce the msp minimum support price by the govt be include in the bill also it be so very difficult to establish the msp for a particular product for the entire country since the labor in the farming will be so different between state to state
farmer peaceful agitation should be allow govt should hear them and support their cause after all it be the peoples government please try to solve their problem without any police force
all khalistani supporter they have seal the the capital lol

farmer be truly logical u be in secular country not in dictatorship
anonymous official we be in a state where slavery have be accept wholesale and there be people who believe that the ruling class have the legitimate moral right to rule and other people be legitimately their slave this be really where we be at in humanity worldwide and the vast majority of people have accept that paradigm and what it be it be a cult religious belief system that be completely false completely erroneous there be not enough people speak out encourage that that be a false paradigm and belief system this be what the message that we have to put out there to this body of the population that still believe the mainstream medium narrative and still believe the government narrative to believe in authority be to condone slavery that be exactly what it be stop sugarcoat it and start say what it be to other people to believe in authority be to condone slavery if you be a believer in authority and you be a believer that there be moral legitimacy to government you be someone who be say i believe in and condone slavery because that be what the right to command and rule other people be it be slavery and that be what government be on it face and i will not sugarcoat that that be what it be i m here to put that out there a the plain and simple truth and encourage others to do the same there be no such thing a the right to rule or command others we have to stop believing that there be because to even believe it be to condone slavery and it be completely immoral and it be completely base on violence so now what be happen be that the narrative of this master class be be say never to be question it be not to be question by member of the slave class this be what all this social shaming be all about by the member of the cult see the cult member want to point finger at other people who do not believe their worldview of authority their authoritative authoritarian worldview you know they want to say oh shame on you no not shame on u shame on you for accept that slavery be morally legitimate how about that that be how the table have to be turn your worldview be false and illegitimate morally on it face and now big tech company big tech corporation be try to make it impossible to get the word out by censor social medium and censor people and deplatforming them and all that be gon na do be insight very very dark day ahead let be just say it be already turn in that direction because of how people have be oppress and people do not understand what it be a powder keg it be not just a powder keg here in america folk it be a powder keg worldwide and you better psychologically prepare yourself and i m tell everybody out there too because most people who say they be for the truth and for freedom do not do their work they fail at their job to morally educate the public there be not enough of the voice of truth the reality be speak into existence lady and gentleman the universe have speak into existence what we experience in our daily reality in the aggregate in the collective be base upon what people say what people accept into them the information they take in and that be what inform their behavior and now what the rule class want to do be try to make it impossible to get that word out there and they be go to ensure a violent outcome a a result of that that be what i have be try to prevent from day one and that be what i have be try to tell my viewership and listenership that it be your personal responsibility through your action to help prevent by teach people true morality and unfortunately we be fail in that job collectively we be fail in that job and you be go to see the result of that failure in the physical world these people believe that all alternative viewpoint of reality perspective of reality be to be ban and banish and even possibly make illegal okay people who do not accept their worldview a it be put out there by the mainstream medium and the government and other official or expert be not to be challenge and they be to have their right strip from them if they do not accept that worldview well i do not accept your worldview i believe my knowledge be far superior to yours and i m not afraid to tell you that the real reality of this be be no one have the right to force a worldview upon others we have the right to speak what the truth be i can not ultimately force it on anybody i could just show an ignorant person how they have be deceive but just like i can not force my worldview on other people no one can force their worldview on me or others because here be the truth of the matter folks government medium and even scientist be not the arbiter of truth truth exist independently of any human be be perception of it it be our goal to bring our perception into alignment with that which be namely the truth and we have to do that through a rigid truth discovery psychology and take in high volume of eclectic information from all over many different source even those we do not agree with put them all together logically weed out all inconsistency so that we distill it down to the base essence of that which be true and only then can we say we have an accurate understanding of what be take place and most people do not do that process lady and gentleman i do do that process and i m not go to have people that do not do it tell me what i must believe because an expert say it i will perform the truth discovery methodology process on the information myself and come to my own conclusion about it and so should everyone else so no one be gon na tell me other people be the arbiter of truth no one be the arbiter of truth not even me not you not anyone a an individual their conclusion do not mean that it be the truth and their conclusion can not be violently push upon others that be what be unfortunately take place in our world people with no knowledge just completely give into fear and the big fear be fear of the unknown because fear of the unknown be what hold people back from knowledge and high awareness see if you fear knowledge because you fear what you might discover it be go to create a feedback loop of fear because fear come from lack of knowledge those who be inform be not in fear ignorance be what create fear refusal of truth be what create fear i have no such fear because i have accept what truth be and i have align my perception to it but here be where we be at folk societally this be what self mastery be all about understand the law of the universe understand natural law and then actually apply that true spirituality in one be life through our behavior through our action in the right way through right action the next way out be self respect true respect true look again at the quality of ourself a an individual self respect be the true healer you want to cure the real human sickness then apply the true healer which be self respect first and foremost this be the development of internal courage to look at the truth and then to speak the truth publicly not just to your family and friend where you think it be safe it need to be out there publicly in a courageous way where you be tell people i m not afraid you know turn off the lie fearmongering state control medium it be an affront to self respect stop believing that others have the right to command you there be no such right there be no such moral right this be the way out true courage courage be the universe be protection it be universal protection we talk about you know protective equipment you know to shield u from illness this be the real universal protection to shield u from spiritual illness that be what courage be be bold and mighty force will come to your aid the people who be step up the people who be say no we be not go to have this we be gon na go back to our life we be not gon na take government mandate we be not gon na take government command because you do not have the right to command u we be free and we be gon na act like it you know step into that kind of courage create the universe be protection i m protect because i m not afraid i m not afraid of what can be do to me in the physical domain and you know what real protection be go to come in the form of step into the courage to teach natural law that be a spiritual understanding if you exercise courage for the right thing and you teach the right thing and you teach natural law mighty force of creation will come to your assistance and aid in your life in all your endeavor and that be where my protection come from so we have to say the lost word which be no and we need to fall in love with it this be the lost word we have to say no to evil we have to say no to authoritarianism we have to say no to worldview violence we have to say no to external control no one have the right to externally control rule or command u and we need to fall in love with that word that be a vibratory energy of courage and protection the word no no you do not own me no i be not your slave no you do not have the right to command me and others no one do so folks it look like this the lost word through the knowledge of natural law a truly awakened human be be finally able to speak the lost word which be no no be the word of all power and only when we say no to those who would claim to be our owner do we stop externalize our power and in do so reclaim all of our natural right and that happen when we start to say no to those who would claim to be the ruler of our life the word no be another form of the word on we say no we d turn on the light
it be a shame for indian government to fight for farmer

i appreciate people try to understand the issue from all over the world but problem with indian medium be that they only present half of the fact that support their agenda i be talk about each and every news channel here so you can not rely on one source here you get to understand both the aspect of a story specially people try to see india from outside
actually it seem one state punjab and few illitarate fierce punjabi be rule india now
this protest and reaction in india be largely due to ignorance farmer earn just a fraction compare to price of good due to middle men farmer be in a cycle of loan and repayment and most of the farmer only know their regional language in which the middle men can easily manipulate the news say to farmer i think the new law be more like antrust law to break the monopoly of middle men and how be it a monopoly well farmer can only sell their good to middleman in their region or town otherwise they cant sell it directly due to regional or state law
a big corp will only buy form a big farmer that be simple economics the small farmer will continue to sell to apmc market and still continue to get squeeze by these middleman once the big farmer use tradingbplatofrms can begin to sell directly globally this will in turn increase there profit margin and may in turn increase collaboration between the small farmer and the big farmer big farmer will then say do not sell to mandi but sell to u which inturn will force mandi to give a good price and less exploitation by intermediary the act simply empower more alternative to market large area of geographic distribution and removal of state barrier the only loser be certain state govt like punjab and haryanan lose their high receipt to agriculture and the middleman who hold a monopoly for so long what be further need be education to small farmer of their right many who do not even know about msp and be at the mercy of the mandis
modi have see your husband robertt wadra a poor farmer take land of farmer of haryana with cm hooda
2 lack of crop diversity and support industry india be a surplus producer of stuff like rice and wheat we just produce too much of it while we end up import some other major crop like pulse now it be somewhat of a side effect i can say a government give msp guarantee on rice and wheat in a lot instance which make it artificially more profitable to grow than other crop even though it should have be the other way round where price on rice and wheat should have go down if supply be too high and discourage farmer to grow them and grow something where there be demand for or else it be just a waste of food money soil and effort now i do know the issue with this a farmer fear leave a stable and safe source for something where they end up make less so i feel government should introduce some sort of a float msp system where msp will be set accord to demand and supply
do you understand the impact msp buyout by government have on the environment farmer be stick to easy crop and wrong method of farm irrespective of the demand since they be confident that government will have to buy their unsold produce at msp

ideally the medium should focus on whether the bill be anti farmer and how not the type of report that can be use a a propaganda by incite sympathy ask these protester what the bill exactly stand for and not even 1 of them will exactly know what they stand on be the protestors also give feedback to leader a to how they should act when the govt be negotiate with them so willfully i think communist leader be work in their own self interest and propaganda in govt negotiation
all condition of farmer r genuine
dear modiji kick this anti national element so strong that this fellows remain their balance life on stretcher
i be from tamilnadu i like this video quite useful after celebrate 72 year republic day still farmer in my state be very poor and face lot of trouble like cyclone flood insufficient water storage etc state and central government will never provide enough money or cancel loan for affected farmer a so many year pass away so my opinion be central government try their best and let them do their work hope it may be successful for farmer in future the whole problem be for small and poor farmer let their child be will help them in condition apply legal process after all they be work in it field for foreign company
the rationale give in your video be wrong firstly a farmer from punjab can sell his produce in haryana so nothing change today farmer from up come to haryana to sell their produce just for good rate secondly you mention that farmer currently store their produce this be wrong too farmer in reality do not have storage facility to store their produce once the produce be harvest they sell it in the mandis or to the wholesaler it be the wholesaler who can hoard the produce but by law you can not hoard the produce unless it be food corporation of india on the contrary adani have make silo which will help them in store once you store the produce and no government regulation stop you you can control the price through supply you mention the mandis be a cartel this be wrong too mandis be establish only for the purpose that farmer can go and sell their produce at a minimum support price or high mandis be just the facilitator not a middleman if mandis be a cartel then they would be purchase the produce from the farmer below the msp just like the middle men in the 1950s use to do it that be why farmer from some part of up where there be no mandis come to haryana to sell their produce in mandis i think you need to look at both the side especially how these bill will help the corporate than the farmer
please tell about 600 farmer which be dead be their family get any compensation for this

so do that mean the farmer be protest be right
punjabi farmer think that they will stay forever rich by farm so time to implement the law good step by govt
1 there be clause in the farm law which prohibit acquisition of farmer be land in any manner whatsoever by the purchaser direct buyer
if india do farm in a western manner with say 100 hectare farm that would support the application of fertilizer drip irrigation mechanical harvesting and processing storage and transportation issue resolve the quantity of produce reach the market could well double but the number of laborer require would likely reduce from 700 to 12 million at which point the 1 of the population still engage in agriculture would likely account for 30 of gdp this leave the question of what to do with the surplus 688 million body
farmer be weak link and they can be exploit numerously yes it be true but bitter
alot of people be not think outside the box with private player enter the market farmer will have more employment opportunity not bear the risk involve with damage crop also it be a fact that private enterprise be statistically more productive compare to government enterprise in india this invariably mean that there will be a great level of focus towards achieve high standard of productivity also private enterprise would have the ability to raise capital and make investment to implement good farm technology in india although private entity will be enter the market the government will still impose logical and reasonable regulation like how the rbi regulate large proportion on private banking function in india also it be important to know that the mandi culture be currently a mafia driven culture where the middleman and government official be in on it and if this bill come into place it would be hard for them to make their cut illegally so this be just my opinion after do a bit or research although on face value we do not see this because no one cover the positive angle to this story
there be 28 state in india anybody wonder why only punjabi farmer be only one terrorise the nation why tamil telugu malayali kannada bengali gujarati bihari oriya farmer have no issue with the new farm bill think ask more question if you want to know the truth

the best video i saw of yours be about how to make youtube video i think you should make video on bollywood where you may say anything without run the risk of be wrong agriculture be a different business and it would help if you live in a village for a year to know the truth a farmer can not sell his crop at a preferred high rate place 10 km away because it be across the border into another state and he have to go 50 km in the wrong direction within his state to sell at a low price there be many such lacuna in the present system that even your private agriculture expert do not know a he sound more urban all protest be politically motivated and would die down naturally after punjab election so hold breath and let farmer benefit do not thank bjp if you do not want to but do not spread lie either

one crucial element in this protest be fear a big chunk of farm constitutes middle man worth of middle man be in million billion this middle man fear he would lose his say in the whole process

everyone should support these innocent farmer who have be harrassed by

bhayia not any personal fight but 90 percent of agricultural expert be say that these law could bring a reform in the agriculture sector and about 80 farmer which eat small farmer could get benefit acc to expert only some change must be do in these law which goverment be agree upon and i remind you that you be not any expert

ofcourse new regulation should look out for farmer but perhaps deregulate the sector and allow corporates to operate would mean cheap price that would benefit all indian and not just one particular sector

thank you bbc for continued coverage of indian farners they be struggle be like look in to the past and future for all farming and agriculture around the world past from u agriculture perspective where farmer be forever in debt and it be easy to conglomerate until a few big company manage all the farming land future because all other country that have yet to admit big agricultural company can see how profit over people will crush their current community structure like watch a slow steamroller raise your house

common man point if these bill will be implement then any registered company can buy and stock crop in unlimited quantity and store it till price touch the sky so black market will emerge and wheat which be around rs 1800 per quintal will be more than this no control will be of government on it so common man have to pay high for food wheat rice vegitable fruit etc etc

repeal anti farmer bill
this video start explain about farm bill but end explain how powerful central government be and it supremacy over federation this video say supreme court be good for nothing it say central government favour only some state and it can go to any extent to curb federal power of it non ruling state
so conclusion be that there should be a heavy debate in both house before pass any law so we can get a soln which ultimately helpful to farmer

bjp sponsor video throughout the video she keep talk about how apmc be be misuse but do not tell how the new bill would fix these issue also all the point she make be from the govt perspective at no point do she talk about why the farmer be protest against the bill towards the end she talk about shanta kumar who head the committe who himself be a bjp leader and former hp cm the committee never mention of only 6 farmer get msp in the report they submit infact the 6 figure come from a remark of shanta kumar in a recent interview where he allege that the farmer protest be the 6 of elite farmer he then go on to say that only 6 farmer get msp so it be just a remark not factual data
among thousand of great story one that stand out for me be the newspaper wala distribute 25 30 different newspaper and free so farmer be aware this ndtv video should be show to every indian now and for century
ask for msp for proucts that be stock in for almost 3 yr for indian population which amount to 1 8 lac crore in godown and be rottting still they want govt to buy and not want to sell in open market why dont they create good godown and cold storage for store the produce

mam you say that with the new bill the fund of state will suffer but i think it hardly matter because even if the state collect this tax they eat it up themselves rather than use it for development here in punjab i know there be no one who actually know where the fund to be use for development have go the people from various party be worried bcuz now they will not ever be able to make money through corruption since the new farm bill come
this model be already follow in bihar side then why there be so much migration from bihar and other farm village to punjab and haryana although it be for the welfare of them a big question
one of the big issue point out by farmer be the fact that the bill exclude a price guarantee mechanism like msp

there be no question on the need for law to get rid of unscrupulous middleman between farmer and consumer how do take away mandis go to help mandis be set up to prevent exploitation of farmer in the first place how come it become breed ground for middle man
when people say that it be optional for the farmer whether to lease the farm to a private company or not i think that private company can easily use their cash bulk to force farmer economically for first few year but in the long run they will just be establish their monopoly and take away any other option that farmer may have once agriculture be monopolize the company can then start exploit farmer just like they do in case of uber driver

1 more than 70 of wheat and paddy produce in punjab haryana be procure under msp and they be say 6 on all india basis which be wrong a other farmer be not have marketable surplus 10 crore out of 14 6 crore farmer have land hold less than 1 ha and major area be under rain 2 punjab haryana rajasthan be the only state which engage ardthiyas commission agent in procurement and in other state like mp which contribute equal to punjab in central pool procures through primary agril credit societys gram sahkari sewa samiti ardthiyas have earn more than rs 800 crore in wheat procurent only in punjab haryana why procurement be happen through mandies a pac be capable which be farmer body skm be not demand this a procurement centre will near to farmer and schedule of arrival can be monitor pac will make profit and more service like storage grade process etc can be set up at pac level it be happen in other state like mp chhatisgarh odisha telangana and up have also start 3 msp to be make a base price for auction in mandies so govt need not to procure and farmer be free to sell outside the mandies a per new act skm be not demand that msp to be make a base price for auction skm be just say msp guarantee which be create confusion so demand should be specific 4 skm leader be create confusion that how a small farmer will sell the produce of 1 or 2 qtl in bangalore or chennai in this connection central govt have a target of 10000 farmer producer organisation fpos mean one fpo block which will aggregate farm produce and will negotiate with trader these fpos will be manage by farmer themselves by hire professional and central govt be give more than 25 lakh fpo a a grant fpo be the most efficient marketing channel and local rural youth can be motivate and guide properly ardthiyas commission agent should not be member of fpos visit sfac nabard ncdc website in addition to fpos rural youth can form their rural cooperative 15 20 rural youth or may be rural youth of entire village of market which may set up private market yard or e trading centre these rural cooperative will get their service charge or can set up their processing unit and can have tie up with retailer like reliance dress big bazar or can open their marketing outlet in nearby city moong will be produce by farmer and will be procure by local rural cooperative which can set up their pulse unit also and govt scheme be available 5 75 of 305 million tonne foodgrains cereals pulse a oilseed be not a part of foodgrains consists of wheat and paddy 235 million tonne which mean coarse cereal like bajra maize zowar ragi mundua etc and pulse have production of only 70 mt of which small proportion of farmer have marketable surplus but we import the pulse so farmer of punjab haryana and western up should go for diversification of crop a water table and soil fertility be also an issue in these area 6 some commodity like bajra maize jowar mandua ragi should be include in pd by respective state govt so that procurement from farmer will happen at local level karanataka govt have include ragi in pd system skm be not have this demand bcoz it will affect the procurement of wheat paddy in punjab haryana a maximum kisan morcha leader be from these state 7 43 large farmer 10ha and 22 medium farmer 4 ha of the country be from western rajasthan and we can easily understand their level of production skm be not aware about the definition of farmer so we can understand their level of awareness about farmer problem they be just befool the entire country 8 more than 7 crore farmer have land hold less than 0 5 ha and pm samman nidhi of r 6000 be a big help to them govt be give samman to all farmer otherwise it could have save more than 30000 cr

there should be a reason for bring these law and pm modi can not come up with a solid reason why say it will benefit farmer how when say it wil benefit the nation how if it something long term that can not be ask of people who live on a day by day income profit basis a loss margin can only be tolerate by those who can if u ask daily wage worker to wait for 6 month and work at a low rate and at the end of 6 month ul get a huge sum be it practical i be curious if anyone can answer pls do

i support the farmer bill accord to statistic only 6 farmer receive their msp the whole protest be regard msp but the the truth be people do not want farmer to decide his future people support the farmer be actually support the middleman please go and read the bill i beg u do not blindly support them i do not want u to support the bill also hear from both side then decide

the research and all be highly appreciated and great but it be sadden to see that the word middleman be not even mention farmer have be get low price while consumer be pay relatively extremely high price for the same crop so it be obvious who be take away all the cream this issue be even raise by opposition govt leader but somehow they be quiet now moreover the way the law be work there be still an option and people can go along the traditional path and if that be what farmer want the traditional chain would be follow without be affect by the unregulated space it be not like mandis be be scrap off the main issue in hand be huge miscommunication between the central govt and the farmer i think both side be not still ready to listen to each other completely and other people be try to advantage of this our duty at the moment must be to allow free flow of knowledge on both side to reach an absolute consensus instead of just be one side to look revolutionary
the answer will say how it harmful to farmer

so much western leftist bias misinformation spread about india and the new farm law most of these protestors be not even farmer they be middle men who will lose their business once the free market be introduce to the farming sector and the protestors mostly middleman be only from 2 state punjab and haryana farmer and middle men in rest of india be completely fine with the new law a trevor say in the video there be 600 million people in the agriculture industry in india by the way india have 150 million farmer the other 450 million people be middle men service and transport company distributor etc if this farm law be so bad then india would come to a halt because 600 million people be almost 50 of india be population
this situation be not be clearly represent on the medium the agriculture law be actually helpful to farmer from poor part of the country
yes india 60 to 70 population directly and indirectly be framer so no government can stand when even 50 farmer agianst government so we can say that they be nit farmer they be political worker of opposition
make apmc be strong be not the solution bcuz then the structure remain the same if the msp be raise then the consumer will suffer bcuz ultimately the crop will go through a 50 cost inflation due to the presence of middleman in this system if the msp be not raise then the farmer will suffer a usual
somehow it feel like this guy sengupta be accustom to see glass half empty he doesnt see the power of market economy all the issue he talk about be hypothetical and fail to mention that one big business can be evil if it have sole power the contract be for a tranche of produce not permanent like the current broker and agent at the mandi today so if one business be try to exploit them another will emerge that will want to buy the farmer produce at good price for the farmer about hoard he fail to understand big picture a big company make money not by store but by sell sengupta need to look at how food be so inexpensive and farmer so rich in advanced economy now if you ask that question a common answer you get be that india be different well it be not so much these economy be not not so great before the market economy come around

you do not mention the loophole of the msp due to which all the gov till date hesitate to make it compulsory the point be simple farmer will start grow only those product which will give them the maximum profit and yield in least time with least effort this will destroy the market with overflow of some produce which will be price high due to msp independent of demand and there will be acute shortage of other product which will make them un accessible to the average citizen
the indian army have admit they would lose an all out war with china without significant outside help from that perspective the indian workforce dedicate to farm should at least halve assume production could be maintain india can though win in the nearby himalaya where their land be steal by the chinese i m say india be number of farmer in the modern age be dangerous to their country

hence the part which need rectification be feature of this particular market which make it prone to the formation of cartel we a human have be successful in create a few fair free market in my opinion the common theme among them be the equality in the power of the participant of this market a you mention in this particular market many of the farmer be actually not powerful enough own less than 1 hectare of land there be various startups company a well the concept of cooperative which be actively try to solve this problem
but why why only punjab farmer be protestering
i think the government be take a capitalistic approach which at the end we have to take anyways india have to grow and become self sufficient and for that every indian should become self dependent so that the government do not have to waste the hard earned tax money and rather utilize on the development of the country although i be not a very big fan of bjp be economic adventure but i can really say that this bill be extremely visionary it will get well over time great job

i stand with the farmer it be high time that we a citizen stand up against this fascist regime and question this government for fill the pocket of the so called industrialist
therefore farmer be protest because ther be no rule or penalty on msp neither in future and quality base purchasing system that a farmer cant produce crop a the contrator want therefore contractor purchase it on less price which loss the farmer

the problem be face by both farmer and the nation collectively but the implementation of these law will not have the effect they intend to have for example the hoarding law removal will prevent mismanagement of stock but it will also cause well hoard and then there be no provision against that so exclude such crop from essential commodity just to gain that one law be not the answer a more thorough inspection be need of these law but the government be stubbornness do not help

a poor farmer have no place to store their vast produce if mandi system be retire where will poor farmer store his produce
and also if msp be set low than what farmer be expect then it a total mess because no one know about climate and the order of produce different vegetable say for example farmer potato msp be at hood level and have security that potatoes wont spoil and on other hand there be tomato which have high chance of spoilage and also have low msp compare to potatoes preferably at a level once this thing will happen that majority of farmer produce potato and than it be in huge amount and waste of everything and mark the scarcity of other vegies

no we actually dont need the government to do this bcoz for be a competitior it be fine if they oppose but there should be a regulatory body for agriculture just like an organization jisme ba kishano ka faida ho and our give the right to oppose the law of government on behalf of farmer toh ab jaise dispute ho rahe woh bhi nahi hoge amul jaisa ek model i wish entrepreneur look upon on this a an social opportunity and not a business opportunity i wish i could have a business model oh sorry i mean social model know this
on the other hand everthing depend on demand and supply of anything so if any thing be produce in excess no one will purchase at msp except govt and govt can only purchase till it store capacity be not full on the other hand if domestic agriculture produce be itself expensive then international mkt then why one would purchase from domestic market rather they will import from other country such thing will be do that be why only msp can be guarantee by govt but govt can not impose msp on private sector because over all price depends on demand supply of produce and every produce be not of the same quality so msp can not be same of same product with different quality if msp be make mandatory on private sector then bad and good quality produce have at same msp think be it possible then why one would purchase from farmer if something be impose without any benefit yes it be true that a price should be fix a per the demand and supply by the govt that could be impose for a particular time period but not permanently
es bill se msp khtm hoga mean no fix price if compny want they can purchase crop in penny value

modi need to change his action and law for panjab and panjabi farmer he must not do what the british do to panjab he have be elect to look after his people that mean panjabi as well a gujrati
but i have a question in my mind the question be that how a poor farmer can stay away from his her for so long time of more than 1 and half year i ma not a supporter of modi and a of i think there be only about 2500 to 5000 farmer be there in protest from past few month and be it not possible to pay to such a small group of farmer i be say this because in my district in election of jila panchayat sadasya the competitor have pay the poor people to go with him in election campaign and if such person who have very less money a compare to the national party or who want to repeal these farm law

there seem to be an interesting perspective go around that sikh be all khalistanis or terrorist and that this have tarnish their image i believe it would be foolish to judge a protest involve lakh of individual from the action of a few hundred it would be even more foolish to label a complete community a terrorist because of a simple flag raise on an empty pole

the law have just give additional option to farmer to sell their produce to corporates it be not a compulsion
sir you be just great your explanation be on point and i would say completely unbiased so all this sum up to the fact that farm bill be not that bad but the government need to make aware the farmer of their right
i think if farmer do not think this bill be good for them then people in studio can not shout and force them to think it be good for them we know how corrupt government procedure be if power go in hand of industrialist then they will give penny for ton of veges an internal report suggest if this bill pass industrialist will control price range and it can go as low a 0 2rs for a kg of rice
and then you say that you know about farmer protest

you have present just one side of the story which be bias against the govt i don t think you have read or understand the farm law i hope you notice that it s the farmer from mainly sikh community who be lay siege of delhi and hold the government and the citizen hostage it be cause great inconvenience to people who be lose business livelihood due to road blockage for month now cost the tax payer million this illegal siege be well fund by foreign organization often anti india terrorist group who be khalistanis this group have commit hindu genocide in punjab and assassinate the beloved prime minister indira gandhi in 1984 farmer from all other state of india be happy with the law a they help the poor punjab be a rich state with lot of rich middleman who be out protest a this will make it impossible for them to exploit poor farmer this be a group of middleman pay protester opposition political party goon modi hater who can not see india progress so please stop call it a farmer protest
this be literally only important in india stop act like it a worldwide movement how be it worldwide if it only indian farmer i dont get the click bait
however you discuss only flaw of various apmc act and exist practice not how new bill will resolve these issue except few you do not discuss about new bill for agreement between farmer and sponsor how the dispute among them will be resolve what will be the power of court in this regard what if sdm be unbiased or his decision otherwise prejudice to farmer what if produce will not match quality grade standard criteria inspection will be do by sponsor and they can reject the price can be vary and corporates be smart than innocent farmer and they may take undue advantage of section 5 bargain power of big corporates may induce individual farmer to sell their produce at low price no other central law prohibit it corporates can now stock huge in their cold storage and sell later at high price
more power to the farmer sw family and samdish and parth
most of the people do not even know what the bill be all about people be hat and support the bill blindly we need farmer bill but few adjustment can be make accordingly a per famers request you can not simply reject the whole bill
the central government just show his actual face of anti poor and anti farmer if someone of them will lose their life who will be responsible
the best video i have come across regard farm bill thank a lot sir
90 of the farmer suffer due to money lender and other unruly character
moral for leadership how north india be important for election

these andolanjivi be get out of control now farmer be die before this bill and will continue to die in future this bill be the hope to the farmer but they do not know it a they be influence by their leader who be politically motivate and protest be highjack khalistani who be fund the farmer leader
the msp be generally great than the price in apmc and thus it make profit to farmer
finally our farmer have win but we must must never forget those braveheart farmer who lose their life in this year long protest
this one of the fake protest for nothing it helpful indeed farmer only
this show the weakness of modi first of all there be no need for such law all the govt have to do be to remove any restriction the farmer might have in sell their product no new law be need the middleman who control trade aid by khalistanis abroad use it to defame modi and to test his will they succeed now they will try to bring him to new low and they might succeed in that also
i love your talk i love your lecture and that be why i be make this first comment here but this lecture seem to be one of the biased talk by you lean towards the government rather be value neutral in term of the content of law for example since 1975 there be no restriction on a farmer to sell their product in the mandi they can sell it anywhere the restriction be on the trader however you say that be the case for the farmer also the case where apmc be not there also your point about the free market seem to be argue that free market will directly benefit the farmer and will take away the middle man however remove the regulation on the amount that can be store you be actually create the middleman inform of big industry particularly that can export good there seem to be quite a few gap in this lecture and i would like to request from you your take now that the government have take back these law furthermore in the start you give example of thing become status quo and just because something becomes status quo it do not mean that it be well than the previous status quo through your lecture it seem like you do not highlight the inherent bias of the government you assume again that government be neutral towards farmer and industrialist alike we know in the real world be not and can never be the case
government back this bill i support to farmer
frustrated political leader get shock when they hear the prime minister be decision they come to know that they have finally lose the battle feel very much proud of you prime minister jagatpita narendra modiji looteronka khel khatam ho gaya

one more thing big corporates have money and capacity to hoard while farmer do not they will buy at less from farmer and sell at high price lose lose for farmer and consumer but win win for corporates
here none of them give an authentic reason why they be protest these be political leader not farmer
only when you sweat in the field will you know the value of the labour of the farmer people live in ac accomodation should try and dirty their hand and then talk
this have be a serious matter of concern since the bjp start rule india the concern be freedom of expression by the people of india and opposition party bjp have be arrest opposition leader whenever they try to meet victim in any matter hathras gangrape farmer be murder journalist murder or any such case supreme court have not be do it be duty properly it have be overlook a lot of matter india be no more a democratic country

we consumer pay mrp maximum retail price to corporate sector but our government can not even make sure we get msp minimum support price which be not our profit it support only our expenditure for sow that crop hardly and money for next crop
the protest have more than one dimension the principal reason be the fear that the new lagislation would lead to abolution of msp there have be verbal assurance that the msp will countinue but the govt be unwilling to make it statutory provision a it be just an administrative fiat but now i feel very comfertable to see farmer unit and i have proud to all my brother sister who be move forward without flinch in this tumultuous time now modis govt have totly lose it credibilty all community be get together and by this unity farmer definitly get their right we all people should rise to against modi otherwise they gon na to make all people life miserable the dectetership will go to end very soon
do punjabi farmer win india lost

that be what the reform be to change but vested interest stop them the new law would have open a new path with some people switch to non subsidized and non monoculture farm same a weaning of addiction for punjab have another meaning but they stop the intervention
why cant all customer buy directly from farmer be wheat and rice from village on sunday market win win situation for farmer and customer all surplus food from a state farm produce can be sell to a farmer cooperative that will sell in other state
be modi ji your friend he be ours pm dude show some respect he be almost double the age of yours atleast adress with mohi ji inplace of modi
it be heart warm at the same time heart break to see our farmer stand united against the apartheid govt which be nothing but a mere puppet of international mega mafia family i be sorry but it be no use protest on the road it be smarter to know their strategy think like them they do not give two hoot for farmer or people of this nation it would be more smarter if the farmer change the tactice and organize against the seemingly invincible as well a invisible enemy and do the unthinkable build your own market think out of the box unite organize build your own empire apmc can this time stop be the exploiter and help farmer come up with an effective alternative instead of just waste time and resource on futile protest help farmer kill those desi mulimillionares local goon like ambaani adaani etc and muliinational megalomaniac monster who will never rest until they buy all of the land of india and yes they plan ahead of 100 be of year and they have resource and patience to wait it out we hardly have any chance against them give them the same thing back patience determination and a well think out plan come up with a sustainable strategy
it be suicide for poor farmer who will be benefit by these three law
1 msp minimum support price should not be do away with govt will continue with msp
agriculture should become non profit cooperative business model by assure basic income for all farmer and have control of the land through cooperative setup this will eliminate corporates who want to become rich and who dont want to be regulate india be a poor country we should have regulation in everything and all industry should become non profit cooperative business enterprise model like amul and aavin cooperativesocialism be the way to go
farm bill wapis lo
whole protest be fund and those die be fool bcz they kill their own family bvz of some leader and the ldeaer who be son alllegedly kill farmer be attack by mob whivh lynch two worker by hit by road on his head untill he die btw that leader be party sweap all 7 7seats that too by big margin bcz lakhimpur kheri be a very peacefull area which they make on dirty headline and common peaople know who they have to vote
sound wisdom of honorable modi ji and kingdom of farmer difference between both one can judge who be realize only see the country situation ll
half of these people have very limited information about farmer issue and new law please get yourself educate on issue have huge impact on our country
americas large protest against police brutality sars protest in nigeria iraqi against corruption russian people protest against the arrest of alexie navalny and now india catch up
again a wrong understanding of new farm law the law just give farmer one more option through which he can now sell his product anywhere he wish inter state intra state private govt etc early farmer be only allow to sell in govt market only in their district
every indian should be proud who think they fight for themselves should learn about the effect of the bill on consumer farmer fight for consumer
good explanation of farm bill be 2020
furthermore with the unarguable evidence of violence during these protest attack police destroy public and private property physically attack people with oppose view not only in india but also overseas etc the involvement of and the solidarity with certain terrorist movement and the sheep herding carry out by big rich farmer who have unambiguous political motif as well a direct stake in the mandis it become abundantly clear that this movement have no legitimacy any more if at all to begin with
well a good explanation but put a mandatory msp be not a solution for example if people reduce their cereal intake in next 5 year but the msp remain same the buyer would be obligate to buy a commodity that be no longer in demand this also kill innovation at farmer be end and disincentives them to move on to a crop in demand take punjab for example all and all instead of put msp govt must setup strengthen a strong anti competitive body to watch over market manipulation and this it can protect farmer from unfair price
it be not easy for government to take tough progressive decision while opposition party go against it and mislead farmer community for political reason however this brave government amid serious opposition be able to do one great thing in it first year the abrogation of article 370 this be a thing which no government at centre have the courage to do in last 70 year
madam it seem your research be one side i be from a farmer family and i know that farmer can sell their product to anyone if they be get good price it not like they have any compulsion to go to the mandis but why do the farmer go to the mandis they go because they dont get such corporate customer every time wait for them to buy their product

corporate be not evil but informal one farmer need to understand a a license trader farmer use any type of fertilizer and not do proper test and not event want reduction sector need to be demand drive not supply driven at the end it a trader responsibility not farmer sad reality we pay more tax they not even grade their product
well he should have listen to punjab bjps mla he could have dismiss this protest when it be only in punjab but he ignore his warning when a fight start from punjab it either take everything or lose everything no middle way whether it be colonialist mugals or either britisher
it too vague to say that unregulated market dont work and will collapse an open market will cause demand supply to drive price which usually lead to a more viable economy also these law help farmer trade their produce all over india without go through the mandi mandis be currently mandatory for any agricultural trade for an open market to fail it would mean that all the trader across india collude to offer unfair price to the farmer that argument lack any logical reasoning
you obviously arent punjabi and have be watch too many bollywood movie and dont know ground reality i can see there be lot of modi bhakats here only suggestion i have for them

apmc fee 8 5 doesnt get deduct from farmer income it be pay by buyer fci on top of crop bill
every thing depend on the demand if the price if the good be more in the market then they can make deal with the consumer directly rather than sell it in apmc market where they have to sell it in low price msp minimum support price be take a a reference price for the good hence make the farmer sell the product more or less similar to msp now msp be not a factor
yet if there be a general election modi and his ilk will be winner nonetheless well do on your persistence farmer
shame on that people who dont support farmer

great video thx so the consensus i can arrive at base on this information be this farm bill be not comprehensive and lack application of thought my thought be simply this if today with all the tech and knowledge and experience we have gain we can not take care of u farmer and bring down the price on essential and non essential item it be depress and really sad i have great expectation from this govt i sincerely hope we a a nation work towards solve all the gap and redraft this to make it more comprehensive to ensure the corporates dont play with the 50 and 100 which i guarantee that any company will do far i dont see how this will stop hoarding in our country where our judicial system take forever to resolve case how much peace will it bring to the farmer most of who have not be able to get even the basic education busy feed our country to have a legal contract i dont see this a solution to the problem face today if anything it seem only make a big mess
apmc should be the key player between farmer and private corporates

these new law actually give the power to the farmer to choose price to some extent buyer become educate learn new technology and develop overall
buyer shall be pass through a proper channel before they could actually buy the crop from farmer a a non legitimise buyer can commit fraud with farmer by not pay them money a of today the licensed buyer have to deposit bank guarantee in apmcs so the payment of farmer be secure
i agree with everything in this video but they should think that different state have different rate for the crop and let assume there be two state state 1 and state 2 and in state 1 the rate of everything be low from every other state and the farmer produce the crop in low price and in state2 the rate of everything be the high and the framer produce the crop in high price what if the farmer from state1 go to state2 and sell they in high rate so what will the farmer of the state2 do because he have produce the crop but he can not sell because the crop have already be sell by other farmer do he will go to the low state and sell there and will go in loss the answer be no if government really want to help farmer why do not they just the solve the problem state wise because every state be not same or the government want to give profit to the farmer of the one state and loss to the other fact punjab and haryana have the high rate for the crop
zero knowledge of agriculture and people be like wrong decision modi ji disappoint modi ji

these law be not against apmc or msp they be to create a broad aspect which would no more restrict farmer to mandis help prevent post harvest loss and wastage abolish intermediary that would lead to big share of price to farmer from consumer there be this misconception be spread that mandis would no longer exist which be not true

well do we have to support our farmer
also how will the squeeze farmer take place
clearly present argument from both side however the last point that our government can in fact regularly do limit free market operation in agriculture by ban import and export at the expense of indian farmer should not be hold against this particular bill the fact exist independent of this bill we can only hope that the tendency will reduce gradually a it only hurt our agriculture industry

our beloved hounarable p m modiji be always think about the betterment benefit and future of the citizen and in particular the farmer that too small farmer now he have prove himself a a people be leader with his act
second it be extremely offensive and false information you be spread by say that the government want to move out of agri business by bring the second bill after the second bill the farmer will simply have the option of alternative marketing channel in addition to mandis this definitely go on to prove that the government will very much stay in the game of agri business earlier the farmer be force to sell only through mandis even if they get well price elsewhere simply because transaction outside mandis have no legal validity but now the farmer can legally sell outside the mandis if they get a good bargain in case the farmer do not get good price through alternative marketing channel they can always come back to mandis and sell at msp now regard your point wherein you say this benefit only the large farmer and not the small one once the private player enter the scene they will take the initiative of outreach towards small farmer to get their produce provide it meet their cost requirement thus even small farmer will have good marketing chance a of now it be difficult for small farmer to take their produce to mandis on their own for sale

let be be honest about one thing everyone be a bargain hunter the middle class do not like to pay more and the farmer feel they be not get enough most of the stuff about private company be merely speculation and much of it can not be totally disregarded but think of it logically currently you have a cartel system that be equally as bad a crony capitalism if not more one of the reason for a cartel be that you have restrict the market the free market will simply dismantle this head on a more player will come in once restriction be lift the first thing these company would do be boost supply chain efficiency instead of squeeze farmer or the middle class it would be year before we would be under any threat of crony capitalism grant some of the most talked about surname have the money to get themselves involve in agro but they be not the only one with money in fact itc be the large partner of farmer and not the fancy surname that be be thrown there be risk but there be much more reward under pressure govt can leave these bill to the state government or roll back the reform but don t expect farmer suicide or farm loan waiver to come down

hey trevor i really appreciate the way you bring news to people be an indian living in the u right now i still be unclear about the reform a everywhere it be only tell that the private sector gain while the farmer lose which i would stand strongly against if the case be that but what i be curious about be the proposed reform in detail because more than often in india and the country alike the protester be give a piece of information that be claim to be legitimate while the government and the protester never face off a the injector of the agenda ensure that there be always a barrier between them so the protest go on for as long a possible that the protest be against i d love to hear a more detailed explanation of this from you so that everyone know what it really be and act accordingly

6 a in india govt have not provide any good infrastructure to farmer to store their good the corporates will knowingly carp out in their produce to pay the low price they want to pay a farmer can not keep their good for long and a day keep pass the produce will start decay due to no good storage infrastructure they will need to accept what corporates will pay them
only 36 of agriculture produce be sell through mandis and that too mainly in punjab and haryana so we need to actually replicate that system and expand the mandi system elsewhere while leave the farmer at mercy of private player with no safeguard be not the solution
i want to thank to those medium who support farmer include akash dhruv ndtv specially ravish the wire etc
without mandi system in punjab only more than 2 million people will be unemployed
i do not know what these farmer r protest for even supreme court have reject their plea
i support farmer people be now believe that farmer be be pay by the high party of india and canada one question for those people who believe this if this be so then why do not our pm narendra modi care to go to talk to them and to hear what they want why be not a press conference hold in a situation like this because our pm be an utter failure and he will not be able to face any of the question of the medium
2 it be a fact that around 14 of farmer be able to sell produce at msp this mean 86 of farmer be not protect by msp do the farmer protest make any difference
sir can you explain why bihar farmer income be one of the low if apmc meanance be remove

i think the government fail miserably to communicate such a radical change to the farmer most affected it be not the first time though demonetization be other example however just because an arrangement exist for several year it do not become right industrious farmer of punjab and haryana have do it in the past and give right help they can master any other crop than just wheat rice i understand their fear of lose negotiate power and msp for a crop that end up rot in fsi storage but with a government not cripple by divisional regional politics this be a good time a any to reform this sector and avoid debt ridden fsi i just wish this be do take these people in confidence or it so appear to a commoner like me
mr rathee can you explain why those bill be not in favour of all the indian farmer not a particular segment of society oppose a party be not bad but oppose the decision which could bring prosperity to farmer be irony
these farm law could have be well with debate and participation of farmer leader but do such protest be just for political gain and benefit a niche section of farmer and not the majority of farmer who really need these law for a good life and get out of this nexus of middle man and private lender who suck their blood and prosper in current situation for which they finally win and a common farmer lose
even if farmer be allow to sell their product to anyone they will still be at the mercy of those private trader eliminate apmc isnt the solution a both apmc and private sector trader will have the same result
do not play with farmer
shareaam jhooth bolte ko sharm nahin aati bjp people be raktjivi chandajivi dangajivi jhoothjivi jumlajivi rssjivi corporatejivi they should be oust otherwise they will sell the country to corporates

whereas a farmer who be not allow economy of scale by law be suppose to produce food at internationally competitive price

sir what about the mandi tax which a license trader have to pay in an apmc wont neo liberalism attract more private trader beacuse they wont have to pay this tax in an apmc thus cater towards the downfall of apmcs so now farmer will still have the msp but there chance of sell at a profit at apmc will reduce but before these ordinance they have a safety net of msp while also a chance of make good profit now because private trader will move out farmer can not be certain of get that msp i just have a this small doubt
still he be not fully accept that the bill be completely wrong still blame the farmer on the name of few farmer any way congratulation farmer

they r not farmer
the issue be with farmer from specific state and they have the right to protest when you quote about farmer suicide but then miss the point that none of the farmer from those state have be protest this seem bias the person that get kill be due to him ram his tractor into the barricade you neither mention the specific reason people have be arrest and also fail to mention that there be 8 round of negotiation and a proposal to stall the law for 1 5 year if i be not wrong to make change and negotiate hope you do your homework a bit more a lot of indian be piss off with the external medium coz they do not understand the specific nor care about it and peddle their own ideology

farmer sanjay singh communication skill nd way of explanation impressive
any protest support by congress should never be take seriously nobody take take the cong leader seriously so all these agitation be just politically motivated
it be a wrong decision the original member be part of kisan andolan and they want to raise the voice of kisan by join politics if they would have win it would benefit farmer if mp mla only can make and change law then why to separate them it should be any mp or mla can join and share the stage if they believe in kisan ideology imagine if all mp who put their profession a farmer be with the farmer be sure to strengthen the cause of farmer so the action and thought must change give stage to political leader and let them talk only about kisan welfare

if modi be do everything to fight against muslim 20 hindu 75 will also suffer that mean those who praise him be create pit for themselves
this law will eventually finish all apmcs mandi which decide the msp rate the rate form the basis of rate comparison outside mandi bt when mandis will start collapse the private player will then decide the rate of crop exploit them
under the blanket of covid pas every unethical bill a no protest will take place because of social distance bjp be like karr lo jaldi jaldi jitna ho jayee utna jaldii
even the farmer can join and form cooporatives
if indian farm be fail then india be fail we can not eat money technology bullet vehicle road no body able to find alternative of food
so basically if farmer get 10 r for their crop that minister get 200 r
now government ought to have make it vision clear and make the farmer aware to a large extent of the long term policy and not act on the consent of a select few
problem be population small farmer be small becoz previous generation have 10 son for 50 acre of land and now they have 2 acre in 3 son farm cant feed so many ppl on a small piece of land you have to value add in it or to give smone who be more sufficient in it by use of scientific method of grow crop
can expert here tell me point wise the benefit of these law for farmer and also address the apprehension of the farmer
you guy need to set the context right only farmer of two state be protest and they arent rich becaus eof goverment oversight they be rich because these state have good water and other resource for farm compare to state like bihar also bihar farmer arent poor because of the free market access

9th concept of assured income be go to come in near future not only for farmer but for every one please read about universal basic income but govt have to decrease it wasting of money to implement this
but now the protest be just to stop bjp government from reform indian agriculture
capital punishment of ashis mishra and others long live united farmer movement boycott ambani adani be government everywhere in india
needless to say the weather the plant sapling and greed be few of the cause why indian farming system fail
why farmer be protest
this be the half story there be a lot of flaw like the interference of middleman etc in the previous system which will be lift by these reform the way the old system be describe do not work a smoothly in reality and the majority of the overseeing authority be corrupt which take supply from farmer at exceedingly low cost price my uncle have be a victim of this it be not devastate as mention there be some change that be request by the farmer which be be work on by the government there be peaceful protester and then others a politically driven people drive a lot of this people who be not even genuine farmer it would have be great if both side of the story would have be cover
ofcourse the bill be never pass in a democractic manner and if the farmer themselves do not want this bill who the fuck be these politician to enforce this on them our common people should indeed support our farmer first and not the government coz they never think about u
farmer to indian people acknowledge u
contract with pepsi and other agro business will improve the overall agri chain u see farmer will get good seed minimum insurance amount and more profitable farm product indian farmer be stick with rice and wheat when be they gon na experimnet on cultivate different product that might grow in india and which be profitable when a company approcahes a farmer to cultivate say avocado in india the company bore the research and risk of the crop failure and if the crop be a sucess in india do u think neighborhood farmer would sit still they would also grow avocados a new product in market and one more choice to farmer
farmer deserve to make a living dont let the rich take everything like they have in america big business put the little farmer out of their land buy them up
sir again here be a point come how farmer can put there problem in front of government because start of protest against bill be a logical but now this protest take face of political angel so how farmer can get benefit and i think some where there be a lake of information between farmer should government take serious meeting or campaign to analyzi the situation of farmer what be the main problem behind the protest or any other miss constipation if every think be clear then what be the problem and then what will be the permanent and satisfactory solution for small and large farmer thank you sir and ma be for the video it i will help lot of people who only see one side and make decision this will help to know more about farmer condition hope farmer get best what they deserve
there be several protection for the small farmer to prevent land grabbing and corporatization again the msp aspect protect the farmer from any contract price set by big player through contract or mandi sale this be a very progressive bill and surely set out to benefit the farmer who can look outwards to benefit and expand their operation provide some clause be put in place to prevent abuse case in point be the benefit to kashmiri apple farmer from msp and purchase of apple by nafed
government be do this not to benefit the farmer but to pay back corporates who have fund election rally and mla mp purchase otherwise government have no incentive to meddle in a subject which come under the state list
now those farmer who be in support of this three law should come out in street in protest of modiji be decision
first of all a request to the medium house please do not term the people who die or those who be protest a farmer verify their antecedent do not jump to conclusion
dalal would tell the rate to farmer and farmer will have to sell a per dalal rate
mam pls be lil practical these black law wont benefit our farmer but will surely help the corporates

india be a very complex system where the middle class enjoy cheap food price and farmer receive low price for their crop a they currently be not allow to store crop pay high price for input and do not have the ability to protect themselves with future contract the current system in india be not sufficient to support all the small farmer in india they lack the scale to produce store and market their own product a free market can only work which these bill seek to do if both buyer and seller have equal bargaining power small farmer be not only lack the skill but also the knowledge to effective participate in a free market they free they will be crush under low price the government should offer assistance and compensate for farmer harm by these law until the economy normalized india need to grow beyond have million of small farmer and the farmer need to accept their faith but i think the government do not do a good job in market these bill also the people of punjab be well off farmer compare to rest of india if you look at the number of child be send outside from punjab to study in college you would understand why punjabi be at the heart of the protest they enjoy the high income in the country from farm any threat to their lifestyle would bring about a reaction many of those protest have on name brand clothes nike adidas and drive audis these be not the lowly farmer of bihar

the simple reason for the poor display of our farming sector be because the apmc be a sham in our country the corruption of apmc and cartel system have degrade it to an extent that it have become redundant i concide that msp be require for the corporate option of sell crop but we have to understand that capitalism do work to an extent and competition in mandis can bring in the change that be much need
you have to be very naive and childish to think that privatisation of farm wont lead to exploitation of farmer by big company for their maximum profit
i follow farmer but what be bad about the proposal one and a half year suspension of law to discussion and amendment
so it good for educate farmer and bad for uneducated farmer
and not all farmer be un educate

they should implement these bill state wise where there be bjp rule party first they need to show the result then these farmer will be convince
sath hi sath farmer be already allow to sell their produce in any of the state the limitation be only with the middleman
finally a relief for farmer
and request modi to come with the law opposition be totally crushed and the bastard who do bastardisation of politics in india will be out totally
stupid decision farmer should have read the law because if they do they would have understand these law would benefit them hugely they would have make high income throughout the year therefore a reduction if not a complete stop of farmer commit suicide
modi ne farmer kibaat nahi maani he be afraid of loose in coming election

mr malik be very dangerous person please talk in sense position in the debate i be very proud of my hon ble prime minister mr narinder modi ji
my suggestion i do not see any private company who work for public the poor farmer can not bargain and sell good at apmc not even in msp so how can farmer can bargain with private company accord to me if there be no corruption farmer will get their cut correctly secondly farmer empowerment farmer bargain capacity that be what we need
come at minimum support price msp how many western country you can name follow this practice probably none why because msp system be against farmer how it be an old say in economics demand raise the price only licence holder trader or govt can buy farmer produce in apmc mandi no outsider be allow to directly purchase from farmer thus leave farmer at the mercy of bunch of crook trader and govt remember govt would only buy that much which be sufficient for the population it will not buy and it should not buy everything
i know this be a fault of the government but you be all get quite on 26th january 2021 when farmer tractor march to the red fort kill thousand of police officer and create a mass destruction
modi be a very egoistic person he must be have some other plan to screw unsuspecting farmer

the theory of digital platform for sell the good in all over the india where the farmer get good price be good take of government but the mainwhile manipulation of rate under the essential commodity act be the big concern for the citizen of india hope the government will understand and do change in the essential commodity act
secondly a you say the government want to be out they do not want to give msp to farmer
the exist system would remain in place a it be the government have just offer an alternative which be high profitable for farmer
one can be super optimistic about the current bill even after the recent trend of petrol price and the tariff of jio telecom service which once come with unlimited call
never should we give this much power to one party it our fault but this mistake will not happen in 2024 support farmer
leave the farmer let u think of business men if these agri law be implement what and how benefit the businessmen
only 1 5 crore people pay tax on their income but a farmer have to pay tax ce and other charge on his produce what kind of equality be this 85 r small and marginal farmer who lack access to formal credit and alternative employment this be the main reason for farmer suicide

it look a though the general public should be the one protest in delhi not the farmer
after watch this video everyone think that farmer will get good return than what they be get now but what i feel be they be go to get crush because in india small farmer count be more than big farmer company can not go to each and every small former for trade and these small farmer do not get minimum selling price even at out side market because nobody care for msp of crop like our indian government escape from responsibility of protect them corporate company be go benifit definately a big from this act

i think with this new farm law the farmer get the protection from company it a double edge sword even for the trading company too but i be not sure how smart the farmer be when they be into contract but i be sure there will be some clause that these company could be able to exploit in favour to the company rather than farmer
every one must buy them with atleast that price msp
indian farmer be in much good shape and after the law it will only get good for farmer and business
salut to punjab haryana up kerela every person from every city every person be a good human be who be support kisan andolan i salute you be unite rab ji mehar karn tuhaade sb te

in this episode you do mention all state who support ths protest just to bring to your notice many farmer from southern state of kerala tamilnadu telangana also do join this protest and their leader even address their meeting i think they need a mention here to show the solidarity and unity of farmer my opinion
farmer could be give facility to store in public warehouse and be give nwrs they may use these nwrs in bank to get price at current rate if they want they may get back nwrs if they pay back interest to bank ab jo cheej bhech rhe thae usko mortgage kr do price shoot krta hn toh nwrs wapas le lo nhi toh sab bank ke maathae agri ko market access ki bahut jaroorat hn haste be to double farmer income by 2022 baaki apna vivek istemaal kariye

so it finally go to impact middle class people and small farmer and most concerned part be loss of subsidy and the msp legal agreement how will set price ex if farmer at different region sell onion at different rate like 40 30 32 35 then obviously cooperative have muscle power to buy at low price and sell them at 49 increase in price a farmer do not have storage or hold capacity
what a great democratic leader absolutely humble in accept mistake it only take him 1 year 700 death of farmer and by poll election result to take such a brave decision may india continue to move forward in this direction of leader like him for self destruction
i be also farmer son but this law be very beneficial to farmer old be be good but new law frovides wide range of option to farmer to shell their product an old law be also present alon with new law

only 6 of indian farmer need the msp subsidy majority in punjab
win election be the only motivation for modi how many farmer die in this silent agitation a clear example that this government lack wisdom when the farmer be absolutely unconvinced with the farm bill where be the tear hurry to have it promulgate a victory that be absolutely total for farmer bravo my sikh brother you prove yet again that nothing unfair can be bulldoze into you salute your courage resilience and fortitude brother
yeahhhh it not a easy a topic to discuss in 8 minute you get opposition party communists khalistanis big farmer middle men etc and it a hot soup of mess
now if this be not happen then either farming be an irrelevant business with increase efficiency a a handful of farmer or corporates can now meet all the need of the need of the mass because the supply have maxed out and one should probably consider move to other field of business

i hope your thought on why farmer be protest be change after look what happen since you make this video they be protest to get this bill repel the farmer those who be protest be those 6 farmer who get the benefit of msp it would be great if you have also cover why only few section of farmer be protest

what will happen to sc committee on farm bill now
remove middleman will only improve the condition of farmer and carry over the price saving to consumer drive down inflation throughout the industrial revolution what we have see be that get more people out of manual labor and streamline operation remove middle men have always lead to huge benefit be carry over to consumer farm be no different than other industry would we rather have product sell by middle men who have price monopoly and subjugate farmer and pocket substantial profit or would we prefer give farmer the ability to sell directly to consumer set up logistics business cold storage prevent food wastage by that rationale we should have ban car and should still be use bullock cart because car be obviously make in industry pollute the environment and be not make by small shop
violent visuals of rally show and the speaker talk about the protest be peaceful genuine farmer be loose the public sympathy with this act now all the left wing and right wing people give their colour to this act and make it a trp faade for news channel
at the end common man and farmer be victim
hahaha great video this actually sound pretty good msp for security and free market for prosperity lot of farm produce get waste in india this will actually help reduce the time to sell these perishable good and reduce hoard but may also lead to large scale industrial farming and totally push the poor farmer off the equation it be high time people leave all the farming to automate machine easier say than do though
actually apmc will become more viable for small farmer i think
now i feel that there be people in india that can stand against violence and injustice and i m proud to be a farmer son
i want to make the following comment some of these be my personal view and i strictly do not stand against farmer right to protest
only say taiyari karra hu should not be consider a criterion fit enough to publish his view a a standard knowledge or fact at least that be what a common man perceive on a reputed channel like yours yes he or for that matter anyone be free to express his her view on any topic and thats why i dont blame him here for anything but only lallantop for present it up a a sensational headline a per the whole act and law be concern i probably know much more about it than him a i have read in detail the present law the past history associate with it the present condition around the world in farm sector and what the future demand also to add on i can probably tell you actual flaw that matter in the act along with a few corrective measure i live in u a a data scientist analyst and pretty sure people will waste no time in hound that what do you know about ground situation of farmer sit there which be fair to say on their part know very little about thing in case 1 in a billion probability though if you might want to have my view or a healthy non political debate and discussion not about only farm law but in general about many other ongoing thing defense brain drain etc i be always up for it jai hind

normally i dont like to respond on youtube but i will make you an exception while explain the bill you have make some assumption that the small farmer sell out of the mandis while the big farmer sell in mandi be i think the real situation be the opposite the big farmer have contact and have the know how of the market most importantly he have the money so if the item be not perishable like vegetable or fruit then he have sit on it and store it and wait for the appropriate time when the price rise and then take it out for sell on the other hand the small farmer be in dire need to money that be why they have to go to mandi where on the middle exploit them the other thing be why be it that you always try to bring the big corporation have you see the song padara padara from mahesh babu movie in that song he bring the city folk to the village and that be what be the need of the hour we need to know our village well instead of the big corporation why not have small cooperative set up both by the ordinary people and the farmer where on the farmer will sell their product and the ordinary people cooperative can buy off these farmer cooperative for the right price you have talk about the msp well the government be job be to give such msp a to have balance of both the trouble be with the hoarder who the government be compel with these law and i think that the real problem be there big farmer and middle man want that and that be why i think they have nothing but instigate the ordinary farmer in these protest plus political party
if they love farm soo much why leave india poverty

there be no reason for farmer not to be in control of their own crop
another thing most of the small farmer be already be exploit by the big farmer since these big farmer be buy crop at a price lower than the msp the point of this law be to provide a path for the small farmer to sell their crop directly to the wholesaler which would guarantee them a good price than if they have sell it to these big farmer it be about give the small farmer more agency over the price that they receive for their crop this be a two way argument you can not talk about one side and ignore the other

and in the protest there be more khalistani be than farmer
correction the apmc in different state be regulate by the respective sarkar of that particular state one of the major concern of the farmer be the fear of lose land to the big giant which be not discuss in the video which in turn be just fear with no ground since the contract farming a told in the bill and in this video will only be do on the produce and it must not include binding of any kind on the land of the farmer i completely agree that these reform seem to be a bit theoretical revolution but the need of the hour be to plug the loophole which be give the farmer genuine concern not force the complete withdrawal of these bill i would not like to talk about how the bill be pass tho
a question to vice team please ask that respectable saradarji why be america canada and u k stand in solidarity with farmer i be pretty sure he will not be able to answer most of these people in foreign country want a sikh state that be khalistan and we all know funding of protest come from hawala sector through pakistan and canada
if farmer be not happy change law a per their will
fun fact many thug be involve in the protest so the actual farmer be push back after 26th jan incident
one of the big issue i see here be that the farmer be not able to avoid exploitation because they do not completely understand the complexity of this system what if someone reliable authorise by the government who understand the whole system act a a 24 7 or less hour support advisor and monitor on the farmer side of the business someone who will prevent the exploitation when under such pressure
ma be farmer know about msp they do not get in regime of the govt and why do you think they will get msp when there be a parrallel ecosystem that too lead by private sector there be no law regulate msp in new bill we want govt to give u a fourth ordinance cite we will get msp for sure that way only your 6 figure will increase to 40 50 but all there be mention be govt be not strike off the msp it will be still there do not you think it be hollow
we be farmer we know it

the problem with u indian be that our mind be so deeply root in socialism that we resist any change and consider money be the root of all evil have say that these reform in agricultural sector be similar to the lpg reform bring in 1991 and remember that even at that time in 1991 we protest against these reform but eventually it be a good and a necessary move p not a bjp supporter
farmer r go to take roop

but why only farmer of only one state be protest not whole india
summary of some of the destructive point in farmer bill watch between 1 25 50 to 1 29 35
as far a i think about these reform in all 3 bill be not sufficient and suitable for farmer because a a farmer i feel that crop selling be not possible without a middle agent artiya big trader big basket groferse jio fresh etc purchase only best quality crop product grain fruit but remain product crop and fruit they never purchase and ultimately farmer have to go in these all apmcs to sell their remain
i be farmer son i proud to be a farmer son i have 5 acre land but government rate on wheat 1920inr per 1 quintal govt declare this rate ok
jab government 23 mein se khud hame sirf 2 wheat and rice ka msp deni hai then how be they say ki big corporates will give u that price khud to de nahi pa rahe ho
but more 90 of farmer have nothing to do with these law it medium that have hype them and agitation against them we in the west south be take advantage of many newly introduce facility for farmer book rail wagon to send farm produce to far away place use digitally connect market to get good rate than local mandis or sell directly to online retailer like jiomart bigbasket etc more and more farmer be take to organic and zero budget farm these law do not matter to u either way
in the usa we need a government that care about farmer
the new farm bill have the potential to be the solution of many exist farmer be problem in india these protest be some dirty politics play by the opposition since there be a election in punjab next year dear vice we all know that you be a left lean news handle who also have a pakistani founder so we understand that you have your own propaganda to play that be why you care to only make contact with derek o brien someone from the opposition and not care to show the story of the other side have some shame now have a good day

hey vox thanks for bring the big farmer protest to the world commendable job but it be surprising that you do not even mention the third law which be even more dangerous for the farmer the contract farm law which will eventually force landowner to work a farm labourer on their own land in case of any dispute no farmer big or small can stand up to big corporates more so when their fundamental right to seek justice in a court of law have be strip away by this bill please research and report this thanks
in full support of the agri bill govt organization do not have expertise to drive a massive industry we have 6 middleman between farmer and the consumer at the moment accord to the stats if a big more streamlined player can cut the gap between farmer be price and consumer cost while also provide storage capacity will improve farmer be profit and stabilize the price too people hat on this bill need to look at the stats we have massive potential to export we need the private player to do it this be not a zero sum game

vice fail to show other farmer in this protest it be not just the sikh who be there there be lot of other indian farmer too
farmer and private company be safe
your discussion be not only illuminate but also inspire the three farm law a on today stand scrap you have endorse my hunch that the the agitation be basically engineer by rich farmer and middleman especially from punjab and haryana you miss one point that kerala essentially a socialist state never legislate apmc act hence the farmer do not have to offer their produce at designated marketplace to licensed middleman one reason could have be kerala be not into subsistence farming of paddy the other reason be must have be political which be that the entire focus of support the farmer be the farmer of punjab and haryana may be because the people who represent the farming interest at the centre be basically from these two state so the economic and political focus of green revolution be centre on these two state i would say a partisan approach to a national issue if farmer from other state be similarly engage there be no reason why they could not have rise to the occasion again there be no reason why 88 and 70 of national procurement of paddy and wheat should happen from punjab and haryana time the centre distribute it procurement more equitably among all indian state this will immensely benefit punjab and haryana a their farmer will shift focus to other crop thereby reduce the ecological burden on these state of grow rice and wheat
what about the other 4 who be kill by the farmer
i think that the bill have two flaw 1 the removal of msp outside apmc market which be bad 2 the non interference of the government in sale of agricultural commodity outside apmc i e in private market there could have be strict law accord to how private company can enrich the farmer rather than impoverish them for their own profit making purpose for company charge less than msp there can be strict tax law or penalty for them
power to farmer of india love from nepal

some of the people who say they be farmer can be see drink in my area and create ruckus by play loud music in tractor till 12 late night
you believe that make msp legal will solve the problem the problem with msp be that it have to be decide by someone or a team of some people who have their own limitation the free market have a lot of feature which automatically decide the price a just and fair whereas individual or team of individual will never have the same power hence even if msp be make mandatory make the price fair for both the farmer as well a the buyer be go to be a very costly and error prone endeavour for the government which will also be never end

the government take one year and more than 600 poor farmer life to repeal the controversial farm be law
rather than this kind of law government should help farmer to start a consortium in each village and help them to start to sell their product directly to customer by provide building or infrastructure we do not want to buy high price or frozen item from mall

it seem to me farmer want a protected market where the government want a free market they demonstrate because they fear but they be not necessarily right
now box understand and say they be rich farmer not the poor one be
msp will be there and mandis will be there too but farmer can sell their farm product outside which be actually depend on farmer goi cant force them
if you do not know still you do not know because of the medium you choose a your source yes the word farmer draw a lot of sentiment and we too respect the real farmer a the condition of those be really bad in our county these new agricultural law be for the betterment of indian farmer and yes when the poor will get then the rich will loose and that be what the protest be all about same political party which create the draft of these law be now stand against it just to appose the current government and play politics we be proud to have such government which stand firmly for the prosperity of our country and it people

lol global pandemic be it a violent protest when muslim be kill in india there would not have be a protest if modi would consider punjab to be a part of india and listen to what farmer have to say why have you not put a clip of modi say anything at all about these protest in your 5 10 video oh yeah he do not say anything about the protest act like nothing be wrong simply show how much he care about the people of his country he be the prime minister of india not chief minister of a state or a local mla it high time he take responsibility and act like a prime minister for once if his law be so beneficial for farmer why do not he come forward and talk to him
this be a new political party and be neither farmer be union or farmer themselves by profession they be just a group of polished vocal actor and in my opinion try to showcase and serve a professional political servcies providers it not only distress but sadden to see how bbc could even invite them to give an assessment on farmer issue and air them globally very unlike bbc that use to be a reliable news provider
all should rise up to the cause of farmer all who protest for caa should also join otherwise this govt will become despotic
our govt never post any law with force it be swaminathan committee recommendation that be make law which farmer want this farmer be from only three state punjab haryana and up they have political career to establish here the farmer protest canditate be give false statement on medium they be give place in ramleela maiden and clearly we can see they be supporter of communism cpi flag new farm law will break the monopoly of middle man therefore the big landowning farmer be protest

free market exist in theory because the fact of oligopoly power be nor factored in take the case of ola and uber also remember milton friedman be pay by large corporation btw the introduction of a base price or at least an indication by the government of their willingness to introduce one in case oligopoly start their round of cartel formation outside the mandi be the only safeguard i can envisage here that be the crux of most farmer demand also the pepsico controversy still live on in the memory of farmer in punjab and haryana and other place so that explain their scepticism towards contract farm also in place like west bengal and kerala where land reform be implement be it really possible for contract farm to take shape at the stroke of a pen this system could have only benefit most farmer from these region if cooperative system be first establish and then they be allow to profit from and through the force of the market
to cancel three farm law be another master stoke by modi before up election
6 more than 87 of indian farmer be very small like less than 3 to 4 acre so all these farmer can not sell their produce other than local market due to very high transportation charge
1 the three farm bill be already in place and work fine a of now
the farm law could also benefit farmer too it can increase farmer incomes get rid of corruption from middle men give them a large market and it far liberate them and most of the point in the farmer bill be suggest by farmer union before and there be plenty of farmer and union who support the law
everything be available now a earlier this mean the real farmer be still in the farm and fake middleman be in delhi border

government should make illigal for private player to buy farm product for less than msp
it be beneficial see u make 12minute video on this topic and give only 1minute to concern about the bill and in that only concern be valid that may be late govt will not give them msp and may be govt will not buy but it be impossible see govt provide ration food to poor people at negligible price and thag food be buy directly from farmer and see it be time for farmer to unit and make an organization which can be control by themselves which can introduce right price in market but protest be not the right way because they do not really understand the bill it be actually beneficial for them

accord to my point of view farmer bill be good for them as well a consumer however accord to my knowledge farmer be not protest against the bill but middle man be trader and company be lead the protest however do you realise that why westbengal farmer be not protest against the bill why hariyana delhi etc farmer be protest against the bill just because of government purchase if this bill will pass then all the farmer will take the same amount price which mean some farmer will receive more price and some of them will take less price spesaly hariyana and delhi farmer also middle man be will have to sacrifice their high amount of profit
stand with farmer
if price rise a their be already a law against hoard more player will start supply the item to participate in rise cost and supply there by bring the cost down

indian govt be try to move most of the sector in privatization i think be good new but increase big competition in the market it only issue in price negotiation it a bill for upgradation of new farm business but fact be that it difficult to upgrade farmer in india i think govt should think again for apply the bill
what about those farmer all across india who support this law
when modi govt support swarg lok people
overall this bill will benefit adani and ambani and farmer will leave with nothing and we can say that this be another master stroke by our pm to help their corporate friend
trevor should have cover other side corruption that hold in mandis because of farmer can not sell their crop in any other place
say farm law be undemocratic which be pass by the democratically elect party yet defend the rioter who undemocratically erect khalistan flag and remove the tiranga

if i would read 1st and 2nd law together then a per an already sign contract with a company i would never loose a penny a a farmer either the demand be high or low in the market it the company be headache not the farmer be be not so then my income will not fluctuate
so govt have to build an organisation which can help farmer by give information and decide fair price and than this bill will very helpful to them

sorry modiji we dont deserve you these law which we require so very much have to be repeal due to dirty dirty politics of congress
6 government be not run away from farm business but create more opportunity the mandi still remain to function hence msp remain a it be it be now very obvious that farmer would sell to a private party only if what the pvt party be offer be more than msp hence say that pvt company will decide how much to buy for be wrong
the bill aim to do away with government interference in agricultural trade by create trade area free of middleman and government tax outside the structure of agricultural produce market committee apmcs
1 need to define the regulated framework where government will oversee monitor the contract farm deal present by private entity to avoid any exploitation to farmer
in the second bill will the farmer be able to sell in mandi apmc yard if they do not like the pvt company be price or the mandi apmc yard structure be discard also will the msp stay on some product in mandi apmc yard

agent and agency anti modi group never allow farmer to earn a a daughter of farmer i feel sad
if these guy really love their motherland back home then they should demand that farming practice in punjab be change because the way farming be be do in punjab it be be turn into a desert currently the fci food corporation of india guarantee to buy wheat and rice no matter how much these farmer produce this have lead to over reliance on these two crop alone not to mention the immense amount of water and fertilzers farmer use for these crop a repeat growing of these two crop alone have severly deprive the soil in punjab of mineral and water especially water a rice be a water intensive crop and punjab be not naturally suit for grow such huge amount of rice
it could de direct farmer and buyer can purchase direct from mandi and small farmer convert to labour and market price would variation not good for consumer in india per capital income of people be below poverty line they could not perche their basic need good all over income 5 10 year the life style should be change of whole people mask and sanitize be not basic need of poor people so should be not run the formula of supply demand and storage only run blackmarketing
let standwithfarmers on this for them and for u
i could not understand what be say about the farmer move out of the exist mandis and into the outside market why be it bound to happen if the farmer be get a good price or if it a good system for them which they believe evident from their demand in the protest why would they want to move out also the outside market can also not be exploit to the extent it be assume in the video that be what farmer union be for it have be assume in the entire video that the price will drop and the farmer will be exploit at these low price however sufficient guarantee have be give by the govt along with safeguard against such price drop these bill be be demand by farm union for over a decade and now that they have get it they want it to be take back
bhale hi protest karne wale farmer nhi violent mod tha but jo huaa galt huaa also sirf one side story nhi karna chaye

the middleman imagine a scenarion where a poor farmer go to a mandi along with his produce to get the return for his hardwork he bar the transportation cost a well but the middleman grade his produce a low quality and defective and buy it at a negligible cost the return that the farmer get be less than the amount he invest to grow the produce and the transportation charge what be the chance of this actually happen to farmer of this country

i think govt will never back out in buy crop at msp a it already increase the list of food item under msp and only handful in india context about 7 farmer sell their produce at msp time be also come to increase some private investment in agriculture and cold storage a we see in state like up bihar many farmer leave agriculture and do meagre work in city since agriculture in no more sustainable for them my only concern be rather than make one india one rule central govt should allow state govts to make rule for agriculture in their particular state a state know good of their people need they will implement this law at right time when their people be ready
the farmer from the other state already live under poverty line and they dont even know what be msp thats why they be not protest

as far a i remember even the government be try to create internet service which will enable the farmer to sell their produce to any buyer across the nation and to make it easy for any individual to buy directly from the farmer such democratisation of the farmer be market will eliminate the requirement of the msps which be inherently limit in accuracy and control the formation of monopoly and cartel

farmerprotests
let me go into one area essential commodity amendment act a per you the middle man corporate will give high price to the farmer for the perishable item btw a the large corporates have the resouces to create storage facility which in current law be to be build by govt they will be able to create the monoply or cartel there be no law in which pevents this in india in the agricultural sector on procurement the farmer will be desperate to sell a they do not have the warehouse facility and if they do not sell today at the price offer by the corporate then tomorrow they get zero thus the farmer get a raw deal now this corporate who have the storage facility hoard the good and release them slowly in the market maximise the profit the consumer have to pay high price
i once meet a farmer from punjab who have a jaguar and almost all his land to him they be not poor they be probably the rich sector of punjabi society there be come down south if you want to see poor farmer have some shame
why i be in very much okay with the bill be due to the attitude of the government and their idea be generally to introduce bill first and then see what problem they face and fix or amend them as soon a possible hence why gst be now stabilize
then why this freedom be not give to farmer
my great salute to incredible indian farmer thanks q so much with my humble regard i highly oblige to all of you
no farmer no food simple how long we people live on flesh or meat
victory for democracy but a huge loss for the farmer if we take decision with good intention one should not worry about the outcome

these be the three farm law in a nutshell the agitation be basically against change and also due the fear that middle men would be squeeze out if farmer have direct and open access to market
it be ongoing for month why indian govt do not solve the issue rather than play stubborn and ignorant one can not blame entirely the farmer

the basic economics tell u that agriculture be not a rewarding occupation since there be little value addition you need food but how much be your food expense of your total income you be likely to crave an expensive phone or car which be highly value add product and not link to agricultural commodity a raw material for this developed country give income support while india provide msp the latter be a production link subsidy that be a big no no at wto while former be not thus pm kisan but that only give 6k per year

excellent video two point 1 contract farming could still be exploitive a the farmer bear the risk of reduced production and yet sell at low than market price during surplus production quality clause be loophole that could be exploit by the buyer to avoid buy all the produce the farmer make 2 the lack of legal validity of msp be suppose to be counterbalance by a govt buyer the food corporation of india which be assure to be outside cartals because it be not a private entity the concept of govt own corporation to break monopoly or cartel be use in some country eg france and be anathema in others eg usa india belong to former group with company like bsnl fci ai etc exist to prevent monopoly and cartelization the current govt seem ideologically inclined towards dismantle this model
i be from a small village i think this bill be also good for farmer

if government ensure that there will be msps for buy agricultural output by private player and also may formulate regulation that there will be no creation of artificial scarcity by the private player and also government must maintain stock for hard time then i will support the bill and also a abhi tell in his video that only 6 of farmer get msps so that the remain farmer too will not get exploit by the private player and one last point msps for private player should be slightly less to motivate the private player
people who hardly know anything about india include the farm law be raise their voice a if it gon na change anything

3 if govt or private company with turnover over 1 crore buy the crop from farmer then they have to make a dbt to his account cash could be accept at low level purchase
even if the intention of the government be good in the future let say after 5 or 10 year the rich corporates might start take benefit and leave the farmer hang in the middle
indian government be say these poor farmer be anti national
currently apmc be decide the market rate of good produce and isnt it amaze that even in 2020 there be no free trade allow in farm sector stop this bullshit of something might wrong happen apmcs and msp will be there if farmer dont want to sell their good to private sector in current scenario msp mean maximum support price because farmer be not allow to sell it anywhere else but apmc unless there be alternate buyer how can minimum supportive price be effective it like monopoly apmc also charge around 10 tax to farmer keep 2 n 8 go to govt thats why these middle man be protest not actual farmer so please stop spew shit

china have msp for only 4 commodity china stop buy produce at msp for wheat and paddy in year 2016

the explanation be beautiful overall but the reality be harsh than this beautiful explanation the loop hole that have be point out in this video or be actually there in the farm act be dangerous indeed the act appear to be a cake walk while read and listen to explanation but while analyse the whole act it appear to be a masterstoke with disastrous loop hole i would suggest the viewer to refer other source as well along with this amazing video govt should not withdraw this act but should amend it largely and in any case hoarding be not justifiable it just show potrays govt on the side of big corporates rather than the poor consumer and farmer the suggestion give by vikas sir be also must need amendment in the whole act but still there be many more loop hole and even more dangerous possible harm in this act that could be happen to farmer so those drawback also need to be address and amend by the govt

what about that farmer who die in protest
why have not you mention the reason for the new farm law one law be about ban or fin farmer who burn crop remains after harvest mainly in haryana and punjab which be the main reason for delhi be pollution child even have to skip school during this period and about msp punjab and haryana produce more yield so their msp be high compare to a place where yield be less so those so called farmer leader who own property worth crore of rupee purchase grain from low price area and sell them for high price the people who be at loss be 90 of farmer who own few land by introduce this farm law farmer can have a choice for themselves to whom they can sell indian politics be not simple a it look so do not get urself involve in something whose depth u r unaware of i come from a farmer family so i know and one more point govt do declare that msp and mandi will be in place and be decide by the state govt
the msp will remain in apmc even after these law farmer still can sell their produce to these mandis so why the mandis will be shut down there be only 23 crop which come under msp wht about the other crop that be why you do not see protest anywhere else people who do not want to enter contract farm can sell these to apmc so what be the fuzz
just a prank by modi kill so many farmer

since the protest of punjab farmer i be try to understand the bill but never understand till the date until i watch your video on farmer bill it clear my all doubt about the farmer bill content n concept be very easy n clear to understand thank you it be awesome
my take away farmer want to have the mandis to establish a base line price for their produce this price be government regulate if they many or many not sell at mandis but the mandis be there like a safe net the government do not want to have the burden of assure the minimum price to cover farmer cost it be a about money i e government subsidy
1 responsibility of compliance of any legal requirement lie with the sponsor company buy it thus sponsor can not make any contract hold farmer responsible for it compliance if so the contract will be void hence say that sponsor can add anything in the contract be complete rubbish

accord to what be mention at point 2 that small farmer will not have much acces to mandis n sell outside of state this be already in pakistan believe me i be a farmer and it felt good that govt give assistant to farmer by set mandis so farmer can get good fix price but in that case what be in the bill what govt want to imply be that but it be already in our country and honestly it be nothing more then control farmer and get what u want out of them buyer big company buy on low cost bcz farmer have to sell their product whether on low price or below government fix price bcz they have already give their much on cultivation of crop so buyer company threaten u that they would not buy their material so they would get at that price
i literally cry to know about the condition of farmer in our country

3 the money thing for which apmc be form continued with mandi owner now act a the bank mandi do not pay farmer right away hence farmer be force to take loan at interest from the mandi or angadias yes the farmer pay interest on his own money mandi at time payout after a year

i totally agree if we deny the reform it mean we want to live only in the safe zone sometimes later it will become dangerous to u in 1991 we have see this crisis if farmer want to self reliant they should accept these reform our farmer be poor and incompetent to the world why
another point the speaker in the video make another mistake in which he assume that simply because he have list the three list union list concurrent list and state list and mention that agriculture fall under the state list he have complete the argument reality be that the apmc related bill be about regulate competition in the country this be the same authority which enable the central government to promulgate act like competition commission of india

u have not cover many important point like that of farmer not allow to reach civil court and many others point be miss
the bbc be mean to be impartial but have always only depict one side of the farm bill debate the bbc also fail to properly discuss the negative and positive of the bill the bbc also mostly only interview those oppose the law fail to give a balanced view by also interview supporter of the bill moreover the bbc also try to give the story a communal spin by mostly only show sikh farmer thus attempt to portray the narrative that this be a battle against sikh oppression by the indian government the bbc presenter also repeatedly state that the death of many farmer be a a result of the bill when in fact the death of the farmer be a a result of the protest and so have nothing to do with law all in all the bbc fail to be unbiased whilst cover this story
or be those farmer also into same turmoil in the hand of a big company
i suggest instead of use that ultra complicate system they just use the eu sistem you fix a price and if farmer over produce they be pay by the eu and the food be send to military people in deep need and even other country it be a great sistem that stabilise price and help everyone

if you can repeal farm law like this without any discussion you can amend the law by add or delete provision if one section of society do protest like this and then ready for demand of hindu rastra you have no idea i can guarantee you more than 60 of the population can demand hindu rastra and you have to back off
2 the new bill have not bring any major drastic change only a parallel system work with the exist system prior to these bill farmer can sell their produce t only via govt market

those who be comment here most of them do not even read the bill i know there be a huge discontent in farmer for the government i hope they will find a middle way after negotiation and i think that since this bill be pass in parliament with majority the government will not take back this bill all they can do be reform it through negotiation

this be the best documentary on farmer protest
basically these law help trader and corporates to buy as cheap a possible and sell as expensive a possible and hoard as much a possible in future most probably it can create fake shortage of food demand which can lead to milk of more money from the consumer a k a middle class and poor class of india basically these bill target middle class more a poor come under pd system which be 67 a k a 920 million and they get cheap food basically they want to put hand in the pocket of middle class indian and how they will do it by inflate price of eatable in future and study say after covid era inflation be go to come corporates want to milk this opportunity corporates do not have a moral obligation to do good to country their main objective be only profit those who be not with farmer in this movement be actually cut the same branch on which they be sit everybody need food no farmer no food
only punjab former against it first debate or educate them instead take their cause and shout at government
this be what happen when instead of actually deeply research a topic you only look at one side of the story without bother to find out what other benefit the bill will bring if the current system be so good why be farmer so badly off
i respect you to talk about maharashtra farmer
it be actually sad that people will still blame the farmer for protest rather than the government for introduce idea which be not viable in the long run
plus msp should be universal whether you buy from mandi or not
be bill se privet company ki monopoly stabslist ho jaye ki mam farmars ki nhi

one question aap kabhi khet me kam kiya he jo subject me aap ho nahi you have no knowledge about farm and farmer
on the other hand one could also argue that big company would first lure the farmer in by provide them good than msp pricing slowly enable the shutdown of apmc market and no msp and once do that they can become like zamindars that india be try to escape in the first place due to which the apmc be set up it be a valid concern i do acknowledge
i appreciate this act of pm modi for take back farm law i be thankful to modiji but he should have long time ago because many of our farmer and innocent people die during agitation and no wonder why he take this decision because of upcoming up and punjab election and to get vote
why be no one talk about amaravati farmer the cause be different kindly look into it if you be not aware of what be go on there in andhra pradesh
hey dhruv i do not agree with you on this one please consider both side of the argument your only argument be just that corporation might exploit farmer but currently the apmc cartel exploit farmer too msp end up be the only selling price for farmer allow farmer to trade outside apmc might subject them to exploitation from corporates but that be a far fetched notion currently the middleman in the market corrode away the profit farmer can gain i read that the difference between farm to table be 60 90 in india in most other country it be about 10 15 include in poor country such a indonesia not all corporation be bad corporate contract might help farmer and consumer get the right price for the produce
view for this video farmer be in thousand

congress ke time kishan kyo mar rahe the
listen to your talk on the present controversial bill good i think you have make an impartial and matter of fact presentation of the current issuev a you have remark i too feel that proper identification of the loophole in the exist system and effective step to correct them be far well if not essential than just throw the poor uneducated and or illiterate indian farmer at the mercy of the corporate giant be what be actually need the apprehension and anxiety of the farmer be quite natural and those must be solve we should never ignore the genuine grievance of those who fee u the present bill though pass with good intention will not produce the expected result in the corrupt indian set up in the near future the country will have to witness artificial scarcity and exorbitant price hike of essential commodity the common man will have to suffer a lot let u hope that commonsense and virtue will dawn upon the govt and the adamant and uncompromising ruler
thank you this be exactly what i be look for last evening to understand the farm bill well before pass any judgement comment this be helpful and it strange that no news channel or website have put effort into explain it to u
farmer be more litterate than the policy maker they know the difference between right and wrong because they feel they work they live in the field
the mandis be control by middleman and the farmer don t get any profit
i pity those farmer who have be mislead by some politician into believe that the farm bill be not good
today be a black day for small farmer but here people enjoy modi defeat but this be not modi defeat this be a defeat of small and poor farmer
it be good that the farmer be protest the govt can not have it own way all the time
5 company take incharge on farmer need like seed fertilizer
farmer be never liable to sell their good in apmc it be never mandatory farmer be be can sell their good in any part of india even they can export
u have explainef v clearly sir i think positive effect of these bill r more than it negative effect if farmer can handle it smartly then this bill will b good for them and they can bcoz new generation of farmer r smart and net friend ly
yes today be lose of govt win of opposition and death of small farmer
modiji have ask for forgiveness but this jahil group of tikket will not stop and want election ticket unfortunate their sponsorees do not want to stop this agitation ifbthese iodiots do motvleave then our court must intervine and kick these jahils outbof delhi

this be the way to prove congress be with the people of india well do priyanka gandhi ji
one farmer from our district go to a farmer rally and take poison result to his death
2 state have the authority to not apply this law but still punjab govt congress lead keep push this agenda
they be not close mandi system it be just a parallel system which will force apmc to become more competitive
this be not any victory but big loo to future of india
on the other hand if jiomart or someone reduces purchase price after a point with the new bill arent the farmer free to find a different buyer
if mandis collaps themselves beacuse farmer be go to unregulated space to trade do that mean market economy be work and mandis offering price be low than free market price then collapse of the mandi be good
no farmer in our country be big enough for hoard first few year private corporation will give high price to farmer for crop and they will store it in godawns then they will give very less price for crop to the farmer because they know farmer can not store there crop a they do not have proper infrastructure as well as funding a there be no msp in this bill benefit of farmer will be for very short period maybe year or two after that there will be chaos no suitable price will be give to farmer by private company
this video miss out on tell agriculture percentage also decline because other industry boom which be not there after independence these law be already adopt by developed country and be present by opposition themselves during their governance and that form nation wide farmer only a region of them be protest
u cant make msp a legal right there be million of crop how will u make msp for all the crop if u make for few farmer will start grow the same crop even if it be not suitable to the field n if msp be legal then govt have to buy the whole crop what wil the govt do with excess food grain already 1lakh crore of wheat be go to waste we should always support the free market min regulation farmer produce organization future and option of commodity warehouse receipt should be make available bankruptcy for farmer be must and u need to move atleast 50 percent of farmer out of farm into other job
msp apmc
farmer protest be just a political agenda that be it
godi medium will not show this news they will only show modi be tour of uttar pradesh

the esteemed expert be say that we be bring a failed model to india i would like to correct him by say that the exist model be flaw and thats the reason for farmer suicides the current apmc model bring a lot of middle men who reap all the benifits
it be so upsetting to see so many senior citizen go through all this but also inspire at the same time such a strong sense of community we be all with the farmer
comment halfway through but the farming reform be vital to move the indian economy forward the government spend a ton of money on farm subsidy most of which go to punjab if you be curious
please save humanity i support innocent farmer we have right for peaceful protest
1 not all farmer could sell at msp in old system only 6 do while 94 trade in free market
support to farmer
why the peaceful protester brandish sword against and try to overrun the delhi police during 26th jan rally and yet delhi police do not fire single shot at them even at the cost of their life
i humbly request to please take at the late situation pertain to the protest there be multiple human right violation on the part of the government against the peacefully protest farmer indian mainstream medium have fail u please please we need our voice heard
i support farmer s they be the backbone of india
the real solution to the issue be to facilitate the mandis to flourish in order to do that msp have to be kept farmer market where atleast 50 of shelf space have to be keep aside for farmer produce with a suggested retail price this would protect the farmer msp mandis since mandis would be need to supply the farmer market and they be sole supplier for the farmer be produce end customer who know if there have be hoard go on since suggest retail price would be breach and can complain and keep the competition in place since the pvt player too could sell through the remain half of the farmer be market shelf space their own outlet farmer should be allow to sell to any mandis and this way one county one market be maintain and as long a mandis exist state govts can get their tax revenue this way everyone win
farmer do they want bread or do they want bullet
question so you be say early big farmer be only able to sell in apsm mandi if they want assurance of msp and if they choose to sell to private player then they wouldnt have have the assurance of mandi and msp but now they can have both
it be a shame after know what anti national citizen do nothing be do to despose the criminal behind kissan andolan both government and tikkait look like same team create problem for farmer and bharat
nowhere in the first act it be mention that apmc will be dissolve so how exactly be we come to a conclusion that the producer would have to resort only to private corporation and would not a dual mechanism provide more space for farmer
the explanation be great kudos to your effort i just have one doubt while cite the negative point for the second bill wherein you tell that farmer will be squeeze when the cost of cultivation be high and the selling price be low the farmer will have no choice leave and the government will not intervene but be not it that farmer can still sell their good in mandi at the msp they still get both the option to sell privately or to government through mandis do not they
who in the favour of farmer and who not
at least we be now aware of farmer problem
medium like news channel be not support the voice of farmer they be not do their job well they be not show farmer protest
vow to never vote for the bjp ever in your life jai jawan jai kisan
i never watch any video continue 3 hour in my life i get many information from this video and concept on msp apmc and essential community act have be clear thanks
do not good leader congress aap sp tmc bsp other party and leader bku farmer they do not wise in punjab n haryana other some state no respect in india
this be not actually a farmer protest these protest be mainly run by kalisthan partition group base in punjab and bless by national and regional opposition party that be why they do not want to accept and they will never accept anything modi government do why would they try to host the kalisthan flag on redford on the republic day bias bbc a usual
take some highlight portion from the three act and present a narrative you make a good video under 8 minute but it only cover partial fact these 3 farm law can not affect msp system which be not bind by any legal provision it be a policy of the government and msp have only increase in india over the year apmc have legal backing and it pass by state legislator this central law can not nullify that also if msp be guarantee in apmc why would someone sell out of it what percentage of farmer have apmc coverage apmcs do not cover an entire state and some state doesnt have apmc act
no control over prise rise no respite in fuel price for month decrease income of poor class people be just disgust for month with his lecture and total inaction now he be slash fuel tax but he be lose his credibility he be very much talkative he should talk less and do more for immediate welfare of poor people story of his long term vision and future prosperity of india be not sell actually
if contract farming be beneficial or a farmer get good rate outside apmc without mandi tax and all then why be bihar agriculture system stagger
these farmer be surprisingly very educate and speak very sensibly
ithonnum koodathe nammalude climate and soil il ethu product aanu suitable ennu avar cooperate check cheythittu parayum kootathil state il ullathil mikachathu ennu alla world le thanne ettavum mikacha crop and fertilizer farmer nu ethichu nalkukayum cheyyum because kuranja sthalathu kooduthal output cooperates nte aim aanu athu thanne aanu farmer nu vendathu
i think that this bill should be implement but the loophole of this bill should be resolve by government coz i think that these all problem be start because the farmer be not educate enough to handle these big thing
let me just tell u that all these law be already there in western country though we support our farmer but law have both good n bad and good be more than bad no one can predict future but currently they seem beneficial

no one talk about the amount of expenditure this be all go to cost have association and people who explain the contract to the farmer who will pay them will they be regulate the associaltions or people help the farmer with these contract will they be non corruptible a lot of these farmer be not educate also language barrier and greed of the human where do that end where be it go to be accountable regulated price of commodity help consumer a well price in western country be not regulate that be why mask and hand sanitisers here end up be stock and then sell at exorbitant price you say msp do not help but if you look at it financially farmer in punjab and haryana earn more because of this msp their family be able to eat to get an education and have some form of self respect you also say farmer be think of give up farm because it be not profitable you do not tell why the price of fertiliser pesticide sow reap harvest that be just a few example of the area where the cost be have you ever farm in your life do you know the cost and infrastructure need do you know how difficult it be for small farmer look at farmer from other state they earn far less a compare to the farmer from punjab and haryana yes msp be not something guarantee but that be because the government do not guarantee it and the farmer do not demand it they should be demand high price they the farmer should be decide what the price will be there be no empowerment for them in these law not only that if company be the one to regulate the price why do people cry about onion be expensive the same thing with atta maida daal chaawal this be go to be harder for people all over the country these law should be address in even more depth there be law that say that the land will be take away from the farmer as well what about that take away someone be sole source of income you say that thereis good in these bill that a farmer in himachal can not sell apple by come to maharashtra umm do you know the distance they will have to travel the price of petrol and diesel the number of day it will take to get there forget all that food be a perishable commodity it end up get rotten soon and you would need more vehicle for your produce we have food come from other state already where do you think the rice grow in punjab go to to people who consume rice a lot of people in punjab eat roti wheat atta be what be use to fee the whole nation fact be even if you have give the bad and the best case scenario you have still not address the main issue this video be not even well research the government need to employ more people to create those association also say that if you have already make up your mind then this video be not for you be highly unprofessional if you want people to understand you should research a topic and then make a video to convince people the best and the bad in a bill sure these be the main concern that the farmer have but this video do not even touch the beginning of the issue farmer all around the world be struggle there need to be a shift towards organic food farming but what benefit do that have will the goverment pay the farmer if the company do not farmer in india especially punjab and haryana farm 2 to 3 time in a year to produce two type of crop so they can earn money no one work for free so that mean they have to pay labor a well and if they cant pay the laborer in the field they have to let go of them which mean unemployment small farmer contribute to the economy also do you understand the impact of farm a land for tomato of a particular size color shape etc it mean wastage of food or manipulation of food if food do not grow a particular way the farmer will have to use steriods and injection to get that shape which will affect the health of the consumer which will cost them in health care which again be not something easily accessible and if it be it not of a good quality wastage of food a well come into play a tomato of a particular size will be want by the company and the one that dont meet their standard will be what sell by mcdonalds we couldnt use these so you can buy them the western country be want to stop this wastage of food one store here in the uk sell food that be not of the required standard at a low price it call wonky vegetable example wonky potato wonky carrot wonky apple wonky onion do you even understand what food standard of these company will do to the farmer and environment wastage of food in a country may not seem much of a problem after all we do waste it in religious place but ask the poor what that waste food be for them seriously you should have research properly or ask someone what the impact will be of this if not compare the model i be not against this channel but honestly not at all a well research video sorry and stock exchange be not exactly stable it change where and who will provide the information of these price not only that do you really think the farmer didnt think about these law sure not all be educate but their child be and yes anyone read a bill will be think only about their side because for other people the law be just that another law but for farmer this be their future also the price maker how do you suggest the price someone buy the food will want a low price the one selling will want high price also quality of food differs in each state and place that be why the price end up be different mandis not be set up in every place be the fault of the government also what make you think when they be not able to set up mandis for people earlier this time will be different not only that when the state mandis will disappear the goverment will have to earn tax in some way isnt it so who be go to fill that deficit also the state mandis will disappear that mean the private company will be the only player so even if initially the price might go low due to competition what about in the future they will go lower for the farmer not for the consumer also these index that you be suggest who be go to put up the price you do not talk about quality of the food not only that amul that you be talk about how good be the food quality agar ek hi ko power do toh monopoly hoti hai then who lose a a person who be from punjab and a farmer family and who live in the uk i have see the result of allow private company india can not be a capitalistic country mainly because of corruption a place tp come and pool your produce that be what a mandi be also there will be need land and people to man those mandis vijay maalya jaisi bdi machli ko toh pakad nahi paaye choti machli ko kya kr loge this be not just farmer think about it in an enviromment financial health infrastructure way

i dont understand one thing the government doesnt want to set up a msp for any of the agri product in the bill if the government be not set up a fixed price for essential commodity in the bill how be it go to decide that there be 50 100 increase base on what price in the price of a non perishable perishable item

main na toh upsc ka student hun aur na hi economics ka but fir bhi apki video dekhta hun yeh video bhi dekhi kaafi knowledge milli but mera ek concern hai apne kha k ek tareeke se yeh act acha ho skta hai for the farmer i agree with that but mujhe aisa lgta hai k jo badde farmer hain unke liye this law can be bless but the farmer jinke pas bhut thori zameen hai unka kya aur dusra essential commodity waale act main thr law say u can store the essential as much a they can but shyd when private player will come in the market they will exploit not only the farmer but the common middle class too
a like stock exchange platform may be some exchanger also will be need i mean directly company can not handle farmer so a like angel broking zerosha and etc some organization will be mediator

please tell this intelligent government to please repeal all three act for sake and survival of common people who have vote these brilliant people to power they really can not acertain the time period of price rise price of a commodity can rise and fall in one week one month one quater one year also price of commodity varies in different region across india
ultimately it be the small farmer who will pay for the idiotic political farmer
and why they pass this bill in rajayasbha without a voting on it i think it be against the democracy
but even in the exist system farmer can sell outside mandis that be for sure not give in the video
after all the farmer deaths curse shall come upon this man god speed
one of the best thanks for introduce farmer true protest
it a good theoretical lecture but not practical and realistic it do not talk about loophole and minimum guarantee price for the farmer go back to your book kid
story leave out quite a bit of information steer viewer toward a certain viewpoint what be leave out a to why these new law be need india government do only buy a small amount of rice and wheat from the farmer establish a minimum sale price the food corp of india then buy the rest of grain at this price and resale the grain to the poor at a dramatically discount price the government then compensate the fci for it loss it sound great support the farmer and fee the poor the northern state have establish a distribution market with the fci and sell all their crop to the fci the southern state which do not have an establish market with the fci sell their grain to non government back middleman what this lead to be overproduction of rice and wheat by the northern state farmer because they know they get a guarantee price for their grain thus the income of northern state farmer be 3 time that of those farmer in the south it be to a point where there be excess rice and wheat and because of the minimum sale price establish by the government indian rice wheat be too expensive to compete on the world market so they can not export the extra grain for decade the indian government have be spend billion each year subsidize northern state farmer to plant mono crop of rice and wheat with heavy use of chemical and fertilizer degrade the once fertile soil all the farmer protest be from the northern state of punjab and haryana none be from the other state they do not want their golden goose get take away
north indian farmer be get some msp
hey noah one comment if you do not know you do not know you have not research well enough you have just highlight what the cause the farmer protest you do not even touch how they some of them be misguide by politics and foreign force you have not go into detail about the economic impact of the farm law read about them analyze their economic impact before make crappy collude video which in then end achieve nothing but spread misinformation in the end do not contradict your own theme line and make a fool out of yourself please do not blabber crap base on half bake knowledge
excellent dhruv you explain in brief how the farm law be bring perhaps with good intention but have major intrinsic weakness that would have affect farmer i agree that this be not even begin but farmer have just achieve to retain the position from what they would have be push back to this have give u an opportunity to understand farmer problem and support them in improve their life i hope we can achieve this sooner tha later farmer constitute a huge part of population and if we help them in their journey towards prosperity the country will become real world economic power jai hind
10 why the farmer do not listen to the leader

4 voice vote be only choose where 70 percent of member support a bill this bill do not meet that criterion so voice vote do not apply however the chairman decide to go ahead with voice vote and for his ear it be a yes voice vote be not record so it be open to controversy
i hope this time people protest to keep the law if govt want to repeal the law specifically for punjab it be fine they have a problem with it let them do whatever they want but why should other farmer suffer for it do not repeal it for the entire country give exception to punjab and if require haryana also
no farmer will do protest like this for the sake of farm law for which they do not want to argue with the government properly they be traitor not farmer
this rule will give more freedom to farmer let them decide why provoke them
i be hurt and very sad to see the condition of farmer
1 still do not see a massive reason for farmer to protest if they do not want to get into legal hassle do not get into contract farm continue a you be do now

bjp through out from india
nice observation but it be way more complex when it come to farmer be point of view
it be weird that i would expect vox to oppose farm protection in the u but support them here in the u the mythology of the farmer support unnecessary farming subsidy india should not fall into the same trap and encourage it citizen to transition from farm to other industry a develop country inevitably do
reform be need to diversify crop to increase income of farmer without increase burden on consumer but there be nothing in these law these economist should tell if it be possible without subsidy otherwise they should shut their mouth
the mandis will not collapse if they offer competitive pricing farmer be actually be exploit by the mandis where the contractor of the mandi have fix rate and there be no biding a the video claim this force the farmer to sell their produce at low cost not even count the transportation cost please look at both side of the coin and do not propogate a one side rhetoric
dude isnt farmer can freely choose to sell between apmc and outside the market
watch khan sir video on farm bill it show the practical scenario

i just want to say that there be two boy in my neighbourhood two cousin both school dropout whose only intent be to have fun they make bizarre comment they than get dozen of reply berate them call them dude and fool etc and these two smart youngster laugh and laugh and send even more stupid comment especially against government supporter

just imagine if all the farmer in the country unite and stop cultivation for some time or stop sell their produce to support this protest
congratulation best wish to all the farmer
oh come on it not farmer win but mota bhai be new agenda for something big
wish the video could elaborate how those who currently determine the supply in an area where the demand be extremely high be suffer the bill doesnt prevent them from still sell to mandis but now allow them to also sell to external buyer in other word if they choose to they can continue do what they have be do with no issue farmer control the supply and realistically can set the price to whatever they want so they dont need msp but even then the govt have hear them and add msp to the bill yet they still choose to protest
free khalistan i do not want to support independence movement since india have be support tibetan independence force there be not reason that i should not support khalistan independence force

6 the so called protesting farmer be only from punjab state and some other part
thanks for highlight the farmer agitation
thank you dhruv rathee for support farmer
good effort to explain it in such a short time trevor i will say the protest be a result of reasonable anxiety of farmer due to big change in current farming system and indian government be failure to communicate the necessity of these reform and reassurance to farmer a per economist like imf chief economist gita gopinath the new law will help indian farmer greatly in the long run
why do 50 of the labor force need to be farmer that seem absurd
thank you so much even after watch a lot of videos online and read a lot of article i be not able to understand the connection between apmcs and msp your video help a lot in clear all my doubt thank you once again

i be from south india and i felt the new law be good for u and my father be farmer and simple question why south indian be not make any protest always i feel protest and riot in delhi and north india for everything
second why the party like congress not draft a good bill in congress rule state
farmer protest be right because if trading start outside mandi then minimum support price msp will be not there and initially they will get high price but the mandi will collapse soon and after mandi collapse since there be no msp the farmer exploitation will start and big company trader will purchase in very low cost outside mandi without tax and legal support pressure
critically analyze the new farm bill
2 the concern of farmer be logical too
the indian news medium play a vital role in this they start call farmer anti national and terrorists they label anyone who dare to criticize modi a anti national
almost the same issue here in the philippine especially when the rice tariffication law be mandate farmer be cry about how unfair it be wish you prosperity indian farmer from a filipino farmer myself
dhruv i have find your channel when i want to understand more when farm law come out and now they have be repeal full circle
2 government have limit fix allotted money to buy produce from farmer at price fix by government so rest produce be purchase by middleman at much low price
congratulation now all sell outlet of food grain will be sell by the direct outlet of all indian farmer
how come i do not see indian flag in this protest but only flag of khalsa u r in usa which i understand american flag but if u have solidarity with farmer back here in india be it only for farmer of punjab or all of india be farmer why at 0 11 be it write although not completely viewable india kill mi why write india if you have issue with the govt back here in india or be it that indian flag become valueless once you reach u and canada why dont protestors protest under the banner of indian flag instead of use american flag really perplex
these farm bill will destroy this middleman system and corporates will take over this sector in big way
still bjp be lose up election
rich farmer have win now but the law be to strengthen poor farmer be condition
i personally support the farm law they would just a plan allow corporation to run farm who would employ there farmer pay them wage and even perform good agriculture than the farmer unfortunately farmer distrust for the government and corporation and the government in ability to communicate good with farmer lead to large scale protest over agricultural reform which would actually help farmer current day farmer pay no tax enjoy government subsidy and produce only one of few kind of crop thus create oversupply of some and shortage of some other crop and in the end the land be become less and less healthy and soon crop quality will suffer tldr uneducated farmer do not know whats good for them and be dig their own graf and their mistrust of corporation and government mean they refuse to take their help a well even though the government subsidy and msp be the only reason they can fee themselves because otherwise their crop would sell for penny due to oversupply and saturation
certain farmer who have be sweep train by opposite party could not understand what all profit be in three farm law
where be these people when 1000 be of farmer commit suicide for not able sell their produce because lack of free market india be a country of 29 state and protest only from punjab understand the logic why no other state farmer be not protest do you think the other state farmer do not have brain stop your propaganda take side on international platform farmer bill be the most crucial middle class farmer
protester in india have concern about bill but canadian extremist be try to hijack it
be the son of a farmer the policeman himself be stop farmer
this video be why i hate bjp now whoever protest against them they call them khalistani let it be doctors student farmer etc hypocrite be rule india now shame
i do not really know the reality of the protest but it be my suggestion to dhruv to get information from various source and not just one expert this be a complicated topic and the research in the video seem very surface level this could be a genuine protest but can also easily be a ploy to protect their interest by rich farmer trader politician committee
with farmer
usa stand with the farmer of punjab
and the govt repeal the farm law now
dude the farm bill be good for farmer it provide them with 2 choice they can either sell to apmcs or corporates base on whoz give them good price though it can increase our day day vegetable price for city ppl
vagna randavat should see how non violence win against a cruel enemy 700 kishans sacrifice their life for the common people and the nation
in case of industry in some case the government give land to industry but a farmer can not purchase a land beyond land celing 12 5 acre in up even from his own money
farmer be do protest peacefully they do nothing and still welcome with tear gas
all that stubble burning hopefully would become a thing of the past with the government plan to bring in a policy to produce biofuel out of it and even the farmer would be able to generate a substantial revenue from it and also reduce pollution in city like delhi it be go to be a win win situation for everyone involve hopefully
the person guilty of rid their vehicle over the crowd and kill some of them even if they be criminal and even if they hide somewhere in india shall be find out and shall be dealt accordingly but what about those ruthless cold blood killer who kill mercilessly and brutally just by beat some person in the open field what about them if they be from distant place would they stay here somewhere to be arrest by the police or shall they promptly flee either to punjab or to canada or to usa or to some unknown land so whose arrest be more urgent and therefore should be give priority
farm cooperative be the only solution farmer should join hand once they do it there be so many incentive and scheme
vice should also put some light on the wto and develop country role on put pressure on india to do away with govt subsidy and make fair competitive agri market for foreign player which farmer union in india think could kill small and marginal farmer eg canada where mr trudeau fully support farmer protest but his govt support policy like these law where govt role could be reduce even they will say these law be not enough for fair competitive agri market do more
modi ji new product of new make in india
why do not the central govt explain in detail the benefit of new farm bill to make all india understand
the world have a big gap between rich and poor but india and more under modi and bjp the rich and poor gap in india be astound beyond belief in my opinion bjp and the rich gujarati be take over india
good news for opposition bad news for farmer

all congress supporter
librandus will say he be pay by modiji
bro they buy rice from use for r 14 per kg and sell for r 100 per kg they give u rs 14 because it msp which be in govt mandi now when private player wll come they wll give use r 20 in start for 1 2 season we wll sell them very happily and wll not sell to govt mandi for 1 2 season the govt mandi wll get close a they r in very bad shape and govt also want them to close because they do not want to give msp to farmer when in 2 3 year govt mandi get close then private play wll buy our rice at rs9 or rs 10 because we can not go to govt mandi they r close monopoly bro then in 2 act of this bill they can store as much a they can they wll do hold and increase of price and sell you the same rice in r 150
i support farmer because not for me for u
a an australian farmer and also an australian it be only 35 year ago that we be class a a develop economy then the government have the idea to float the dollar and open up the market the moment that the set price on head of sheep be remove the price shutter then nose dive the same thing happen with cattle and with wine grape we want to establish a wine industry they give wine grower something like 10 year of a price guarantee as well a subsidy to get vineyard establish but the moment the government set minimum price be pull price plummet not because the winery could not afford it but because they see the opportunity to make more money on their end and essentially shaft the wine grape grower by pay almost 1 5 of the price bad hit be probably the wool industry practically overnight price per bale drop and all of a sudden when factor future farmer end up owe money on their stock
and now farm bill be go to be scrap

farmer be our countryman and they be our annadatas
a the government say that now the farmer will have freedom to sell to anyone under the bill the agri business company corporate and trader will be allow to open their own market to purchase from farmer however the big fear come from this be that it will destroy the level play field between the apmc market and other trader under the bill the trade outside the apmc mandis be virtually unregulated
now no one can not creat artificial demand of good because farmer can sell good directly
great india great farmer
if that be true the farmer be go to get the duel benefit of sell his produce to apmc as well a anywhere he get maximum price
the two state of punjab and haryana have monopoly and govt buy most of the wheat fron them

let me give my insight into this in 1950 be india have to import grain from the u a our farm be unable to catch up with rise demand the government bring the agriculture reform which be hit by similar protest but eventually green revolution take place and today india be a big exporter of grain presently we all need a new set of agri reform a the current state suit the middleman and our farm might become arid land with current practice the protest be a combination of the vested interest of middleman politics and high handiness of the government india need agri reform to remain competitive and to be able to fee it ever grow population
disclaimer any resemblance of this with the farmer agitation be a coincidence
i stand with farmer
we stand with farmer
so it be good for farmer be or need some improvement in 3 bill
this be not a victory of indian punjabi farmer but also of farmer allaround world against exploitation of capitalism

however at present farmer be lead btr life once after the bill enter farmer will become slave of retail sector
so 100 procurement by govt with msp not from the mandis but directly from the farming land

the present fear be that conglomerate capitalism will raise it head and farmer will stand to lose once the apmc structure be destroy or make dysfunctional

sir accord to me in essential commodity act be enact when there be shortage of food in india now we have abundant of food n eventually this also get waste due to fact that every farmer release their crop in same time this lead to the low prize and wastage of food and now they can store the crop and wait for gud time for prize to come up

8 22 while here he say msp will not be provide outside of the mandi and so farmer will not be be able to benefit with the msp
for an unbiased version of the repeal of the bill please refer to shekhar gupta s the print also a leftist he will bring a more clear picture than this one
2 the mandiwalas will anyway benefit either thru mandis apmcs the mandiwala cum farmer will enjoy the best advantage and they will even team up with the corporates against whom they be protest no friend or enemy in make money together
if the farmer be move out of the mandis they be probably do so because they be get good price since they would not do so at a loss when mandis still exist you have pretend to decode the farm law where a you have put no effort in delve in the other side of the story
they be not farmer they be pay
the guy in green turban be correct we r with our farmer be jai jawan jai kissan

i personally have just one issue with this analysis which be to treat the word farmer a a homogeneous group i believe all analysis on farmer issue will become much more nuanced once we start categorise different type of farmer base on their landholding mechanisation labour employ etc the status quo definitely benefit some stakeholder otherwise it would not have exist and any reform will hurt this category at the end of the day if the reform hurt the rich category of farmer marginally in the short run while increase the option for the most marginal category of farmer then it come down to who do you support in this scenario
1stly understand farmer of two state i e punjab and haryana be protest other farmer r silent bcoz they will be benefit from this law kindly check the fact
he be be bias here take his word with a pinch of salt only a small portion of farmer from punjab harayana and madhyapradesh be benefit from the previous bill

when we go to mandi or small vendor to buy vegetable we always negotiate price and when the last time you go supermarket and negotiate the price i never and mostly indian farmer be small marginal and pvt company always try to buy at low price possible and sell it for high small farmer will never be in position to negotiate with corporation so basic msp be necessary the big loser in this law be final consumer which be not realize now roti be no more basic necessity these law make it luxury item so there have to be msp so farmer get there cost regardless of demand and upper limit on essential commodity so corporation profit greed doesnt make them out of reach of poor or middle class people

bro 1important thing regard contract firming be trader will by only those produce which be accord to the size and quality require for there product like chip or they will negotiate in price while farmer be not god no one can not decide the size and quality of such good it totally depend upon nature
suppose the msp become legal and no one can buy produce below msp price and the msp price of wheat be rs 2 015 per quintal and suppose the cost of produce 1 quintal of wheat be let u assume 1600 1800 so in this case the farmer be get 400 to 200 odd rupee per quintal and somehow manage his work capital as well a personal need one day the crop be destroy and the quality of the crop be not up to the mark that it will get 2000 quintal then in case of the situation where msp be legal nobody be go to buy his crop and he be go to be in a mess whereas if the msp be not legal there will be someone who be go to buy his produce on discount rate and the farmer will not be in total loss

well do on your incomplete research there be in fact regulation even outside of apmc under the consumer court regime and sub divisional magistrate there anyways wasnt any regulation in the apmcs it just stop small and low income farmer from go out to good deal out side of the apmcs wither private mandis or other state not necessarily corporates and the fact that they will now be able to sell in all other state not just limit to their own open up huge opportunity for growth out of the 631 farmer union in india only 35 be protest and 12 be openly politically align with a party if they be so bad why would the top agricultural economist in india along with those all the way at the imf support the law farmer union in rest of the state have give their support to the farmer already and just a small minority of farmer protest in one corner of the country do not speak for the entire community

ca not these law be put state wise where majority of farmer want to work under the 3 law like option for state to apply or not instead of take it back completely
this be the face of india against minority
i be not indian but i love cm kejriwal ji and his work

the method by which this bill be pass in rajya sabha be by no mean unconstitutional yes you may say that it be unethical furthermore as far a my understanding go about the three bill this reform have more merit than demerit which could have be improve by a few amendment therefore i can conclude although big farmer get an advantage out of it small farmer have fall into a big loss
why be you say him farmer farmer
15 23 you say only 6 of the total farmer sell their produce in apmc be which be not true infact the percentage of people sell their produce on msp in apmcs be 6 there be a huge difference between these two which in turn make the whole explanation of the 3rd bill go wrong gs research centre

a man throw away the indian national flag on republic day to put forth a community flag no true sikh or farmer would do such a thing only an anti national would

3 there be a need to move away from the paddy wheat sugarcane cycle punjab and haryana have play a major role in india be food security it be time that they be give due respect and incentivized to move towards more commercial crop where govt will not have to bear loss india have a surplus of rice and wheat worst we can not export it because the procurement cost be high
a their be election in up modi govn do not want to take risk
stand with the farmer respect to the sikh community proud of you nice video sir make more video on this please
farmer bill be beneficial for poor farmer only mafia kind of farmer be at loss so they be jittery
one thing i would say farmer be say that they be enjoy which be not the reality i have be there stay there for just 1 night be not easy it be just to out pressure on the government
be it possible that this may lead to corporation have too much power over the farmer yes in fact it be likely be that result situation bad than farmer be off in the last 10 year unlikely that be the truth of the matter of course the local government have convince the people who it have strong tie to and the bjp decidedly do not that give all the power to them be the best scenario
the funny fact you do not show be not all farmer produce rice and wheat think about tomato and all vegitables the farmer must find a dealer or seller before his product get ruin this law can stop that the farmer can sell his product all over the india even the world other than government mandi where some local broker fix the price for the farmer product generally these broker be local rowdy with in 3 day country tomato will get ruin this law can prevent these thing you can make agriment with dealer or big seller before the harvest how can we save farmer where all broker suck all the money why these people can not understand that no one force them to sell their product and old old traditional mandi allso gon na be there if they hate corporate they can sell their product there government also assure the minimum price for all agriculture product and yet they protest i think somebody mislead them for their own interest
i m with all farmer who save all indian live by provide food mean crop which be unexpected they do hard labour in sun day n night then we get the food to fullfill our hunger if they dont do this we will not get food so i say kissan be the ultimate undatta jai jawan jai kissan love u kissa bhai with till the end

if modi have repeal the law that could never happen

no farmer no food no future may almighty bless the farmer always this be the most peaceful protest in the history the government should repeal the law isupportfarmers
1 there be approx 15000 20000 farmer in a district and you think 3 sdm and 1 collector can fix all the issue in 30 day it good to hear but not practical also farmer can not pay to sahib but company do
there be a lot more to this story this video do not tell you why they grow only wheat and rice this video do not talk about the free electricity farmer get to run their water pump this video do not talk about that the government introduce farm law have no mention of msp removal farmer of punjab have always be more entrepreneureal i have only one question why farmer of punjab be not grow any other crop like lentils millet and oilseed crop which india heavily import from other country that too at a very expensive price compare to wheat and rice price all my reading about the protest and farm law give me one conclusion minimum support price msp of wheat and rice be work to the detriment of farmer india be a surplus producer of these two commodity just because farmer know that these two crop be sure go to get them guranteed money via government msp however reality be that lentils oilseed will earn them more fortune but the jaded mindset and mirage of msp be not let the farmer come out of their comfort zone there be other state in india which be heavily agriculture dependent but there be little to no protest against the farm law in those state albeit indian state of madhya pradesh contribute more wheat to central government procurement then punjab yet there be no huge outcry in madhya pradesh for these farm law all indian be indebted to farmer of punjab for the abundance of food grain but now be the time to tidy up again and turn the tide in your favor with green revolution 2 0 i would end my comment by say that the farmer of punjab need to transform their farming practice by grow out of the msp trap and rethink their farming you just need to show your fight spirit and courage in change the crop you grow i be sure you will come out with a success just how you succeed in push government on retreat on the farm law
these 3 law be wrong here and now because of the way they be introduce and because of the room they create for corruption however they signal an inevitable evolution they will fail today because of how profoundly they represent the nature and will of the current administration however they will resurface in the future with a new look and a different energy simply because it be the only way forward to enable economic freedom and create competitiveness on a global scale india be farmer must collectively organize and empower themselves to take control of their own destiny and grasp the lever of free market utilization to create wealth and economic independence today they be still manipulate by opportunist and illegal collaborator who take advantage of exist policy to enrich themselves at the expense of simple mind and marginal landowner efficiency must be realize by utilize agricultural india limit natural resource to continue to fee an explode population the intermediate way forward be to give farmer the tool and the wisdom to start down a road to first realize and appreciate their latent collective power to create a free market in their own image and second to create a robust environment in which to recognize appreciate and honestly process the complexity create by the indian way of thinking and operating this be the way
and since what happen with farmer protest the govt will not bring any new farm law for a good time now
instead of farmer bill long over due u government should pass a law death for corruption a in china have this government get the courage to pass such a bill
the sad news be the defeat of ordinary farmer and the selfishness of a handful of selfish people have be fulfil
modi and shah can not force it on farmer it state call to implement or reject it
so the farmer can get a saficient deal for there hard work
i approve of peaceful protest provide that there be a viable outcome the problem seem to be preserve inefficient farm tradition in a fiercely economy centric society sadly the outlook be bleak where farmer stop work to protest they lose what they have more quickly than simply move to newer regulated practice
regard the farm produce it will definitely follow commodity cycle of wild upswings and downswing we can see how much the price of onion fluctuate every single year in fact many customer like my mother use it to their benefit by build up inventory at low price naive farmer will sadly suffer whether at the hand of corporate or middleman politician a usual will act for their own benefit
you could also have give an assumption a to why the govt fail to acknowledge the demand of the farmer
if farmer be not happy this bill must be review or hold back till all concern be reasonably assure and happy let u not destroy it completely
the new law allow the farmer to be free
oh gosh you forget to mention the name of the unmentionable guy that wear glass and just divorce his wife and love data gathering and want now too sell back those farmer the seed gather and patent by his data collection that same guy this video do not tell the whole story thiers a woman name shiva that tell a we bite different tale lol

informative indeed but it also mean india a developing country gradually become a poor malnutritioned country because people will not be able to buy basic item due to high inflation also why can not farmer go to court against a big company why settlement of dispute by sdm which be already burden n not accessible by common man mostly big company can bribe who will listen poor farmer seem everyone have to fee oneself at baba nanak be langar
they kow these who r protest be khalistani not farmer n they kow too tat the car be attack first n wat happens next be self defense
although i think the bill be not perfect and need necessary ammendments like the provision of district court against grievance and others but these be certainly not anti farmer
you talk about green revolution at that time white revolution also come into exist but there be no msp then also farmer be get benefit all essential commodity cost not control by government then why only on rice and wheat if you think politically then you be not know about the farm law completely
but apple from himachal and jammu be already transport accross india without any resistance so what be new in this bill
sbse cool style se cover kiya farmer protest ko
please also show the average farm size own by farmer per state when you make state wise income comparison that would inform people good to come to their own conclusion if and how state driven reform have work or not even well would be comparison chart with previous year to indicate if those reform increase wealth or contrary
i have my bachelor be degree in horticultural science it not anti farmer guy it call innovation it use to take 5 acre to fee a person now it be 1 7 and eventually it will go indoors amd vertically it math more fish in the same size tank
congress priyanka gandhi ji plz leave this place india be far far good under modi ji why can not you see india grow we have india for max year we see what u do too all indian plz leave politics and do not create this only before election god know how u guy think
3 msp be a short term solution for farmer but it will be so much harmful in long term to our farmer economy and environment
and you also do not show justin trudeau be hypocrisy on these farm reform a on one side he complaints against india in wto on the msp issue and now he be against these farm law and want msp so that he will support by the sick population in their election
i dont think people in india fully understand the real consequence of implement these farm law on paper it will sound amazing but in reality it will contradictory to it expect result no tax on sale and purchase be just to lure farmer into an unregulated market monopolise by corporation it take away incentive from farmer like msp
i hope someday you can do some honest reporting today sadly i do not see that happen the sheer unpopularity of these protest be what you do not show the absolute need for farm reform be what you do not cover medium love drama and they be play this up to fill airtime in india your echo chamber here transmit their agenda to suit your taste so you play it up
thanks man for the information so i do believe that wit be neither anti farmer bill nor pro
why modi do not pass act on msp why they do not give gurentee msp to farmer
it be bad for farmer
i be surprise why the middle class and low middle class people be not in the protest with the farmer because the amendment bill be straight out crazy
1 punjab and haryana have since decade shift to paddy cultivation which be harmful
the thing be many big name be deteriorate india be name by social mean they basically work as catalyst to all this protest and in the main stage it will feel that india be harass there farmer harass the minor etc the thing that this farmer talk about minimum selling price it be already include in the new farmer bill the point be they do not want this government to rule in a result do all this dumb thing
not farmer it the middleman who be behind this strike because the rich middleman will lose his job this law will let farmer earn a lot
you both dilute the anger of farmer and show in a way that government be a neutral force you focus on bill explanation but loophole be not give full focus rather than say do not take farmer view before see this video you use politucal view good try to divert
you also say that farmer do not know about the bill clearly
one thing just farmer want be to fix the price of rice and wheat so nobody buy below this price
ab andolan khatam hoga ja news channel ki baat sachi hogi mujhe toh lagta hai yeh ghar nahi jienge election tak isliye ab inki baijaati hogi up mein yogi ko 300 seat milegi there fore it be master stroke from modi he know they would not end this andolan even after repeal of farmer law
china you can laugh at u today and you will be correct no caa no nrc no land reform kashmir back to where it be no farm reform sporadic lollipop reform raga can also do whats the point of so many seat and modi shah very disappointed today
i support kisan morcha
first that girl who have be rap in uttar pradesh how these coward police defend the culprit and now farmer tomorrow it will be you wait for your time
farmer still have the option to sell their produce to anyone
these law be in force in punjab since 2013 and in haryana since 2006
stop give land of poor farmer in hand of corporates
even in late budget govt say there will be 1000 more mandis to be build and msp price will be increase a it be before
in the non perishable and perishable good there be a 50 100 limit in increase do they mention the base level price of these commodity i be confuse because the market be fluctuate and there be no exact price on any product
i be so grateful that this channel exist hope blind chamchas of congress and over enthusiastic supporter of bjp realise this
well say he deserve to get chance to debate with modi m sure modi will have nothing to argue against him
good job nda government arrest all so call farmer and farmer leader sorry terrorist good job nitish and modi government in bihar please decrease rate of petrol and cylinder gas that very tough to live for common man
absolutely correct i support farmer
after a major role of agriculture in india be gdp it be time to make it minor like other field by impose this farm law
chacha ytne din kaha the election aane wala h na chacha punjab u p utrakhand
we stand for farmer a naga
sad for the farmer
the issue be the modi govt which be racist modi have badly tarnish india unfortunately he actually belong to group that be pro hittler so what can u expect
prohibition of burn stubble from crop be a clause in this new farm bill to prevent pollution well what greta want to suggest by support farmer
we be with the farmer
world bank have give direction to indian gov to evacuate farmer from village and migrate them to city
anyway the fact which be absolutely wrong here be that every farmer do not get to sell their crop on msp my father be a farmer and i know it even when i be a kid
rakesh tikayet ne indian small farmer ko andhakar me dhakel diya history will never forgive him his agent
another disadvantage of contract farming be that a company might ask for specific quality of crop which farmer cant ensure a crop grow under open sky unlike potato chip in factory so if there excess rain or presence of weed in crop that will increase the price of harvest therefore harm the already poor farmer
double standard of india or i should rather say bjp get expose
mondi farmer mediator s s protest not farmer
in 45 day with cool weather 87 farmer be die at delhi but government of india do not care about it everyday our farmer be die indiana corrupt medium not cover that istandwithfarmersprotest
the protest be from the a very low percentage of the farmer in the country and from a specific state but because of such a huge number in farm that small percentage look like a big number
rakesh takait be a haryana police inaction creation he be a very ordinary thug haryana police inaction make him a fake political farmer leader
heartedly govt have neither focus on farmer nor try to push

government must listen to farmer from normal citizen to prime minister everybody be alive due to grain that farmer produce farmer be real hero of our nation
a you talk about about the control phase of corporatization that regulation have to be mandate for sell agricultural produce can not we access the process which starbucks do with coffee bean farmer
there be a unfair bargain power between the farmer and private company clearly farmer right be limited and wheres their legal protection be there a independent regulator thatll protect farmer immediately best price for the farmer will be a low price and the private company will sell the produce at triple price the middle class will be effect too the food price will increase considerably
silence be the best way to achieve antly success plz farmer do not do this this be wrong
farmer 1
look at the sell republic reporter what a shame on this fourth pillar of democracy have they be shoe the pain and problem of common man of farmer then what be the need for these young and old men march towards delhi in such drastic weather condition
farmer should declare that government have to officially take back all 3laws in pen and paper before condition up election
it add another thing say that if you get tie up with company they will invest and you can register with them at a fair price which be more than msp or can not be less than msp
good news god bless mp modi happy for the farmer

farmer should go for oraganics and polycrops this be the only way ditch the hybrid seed of imperialist use original seed
actually common people must be protest against the bill instead of farmer
the way vehicle be drive in that video clearly show that it be a deliberate attempt to mow down those helpless farmer rip democracy
i have a point to add the claim from the farmer that he have sell his crop say for 4 dollar per kg it less than his father be but it fail to acknowledge the fact that the overall produce of the farmer per acre land have also increase people dont account for that
u have to research more about the three farm bill kindly do not make conclusion with partial knowledge

victory of rihana greta tumberg mia khalifa and canada innocent farmer
please do not mention indian farmer not whole of india be protest the protest be only by punjab state and haryana
from where we common indian can see both govt and farmer they both be show high handedness there just do not seem to be a miniscule of sensibility show from either side
these farmer represent a small of india be overall farm community it be a political gimmick by opposition party who care less for farmer
this be the victory of our nation a a democracy kudos to everyone who support this revolution both on ground and online
just fyi all political party in india have mention these exact law on their agenda if they be elect farmer of largely 3 state be protest because these state have wealthy farmer most of indian farmer be very poor and the supply chain system be an utter failure here that be why govt be try to reform it now i do not like every thing that modi govt do but i can not believe how misinformation have lead to such strike and thing have be blow so out of proportion wealthy middle men and a lot of vested interest be involve in these protest who have manage to somehow scare the crap out of these farmer about thing that be not even in the law but never mind who care
bhagat singh be reflect in each and every farmer a you see their josh and commitment
and more concern be they do not talk about loan most of farmer take loan to buy thing like tractor seed pesticide if govt wont take part in this how they be go to get subsides what if crop fails
the so called farmer be still not satisfy now they want a bill on msp too
i think you have misunderstand that farmer protest be because they be not explain clearly let me tell you from the close conversation with pro khalistanis it be not about farmer but it be about crave for blood from the disguise ngo donation from isi pti and khalistan sikh just do not matter how much you explain they will give religious political commi angle to even trim your hair
when a person start move towards the direction of welfare of his country his pace can be slow down due to some hurdle but his motto never change reform will definitely come in one form or in other but for sure wait and trust a we always do keep faith on modiji
so this be all about farmer not want the government subsidy to disappear and the privatization of land unless there be a need for these crop to justify the subsidy perhaps not so many indian should be in farm at this point
my condolence to those 700 farmer who lose thr life while protest
india be not only north india and punjab why do not you ever film when the farmer in andhra pradesh telegana karnataka maharashtra and mp be commit suicide how many people have you interview and how many video have you make on that with 5 tributary of indus river they have fertile land and water all year round and grow grain and veggie whereas thats not the case down south and central india
normally i like your video but in the current context you spend more time and illogical argument negate the bill basically you be say that in a monopolistic market there will be price discovery but it will be difficult in open market
just saw republic tv reporter try to change the narrative by shout the police be plead join hand to the farmer
even after give so much subsidy in quality seed feriilizers power and water for farmer and most important they be not taxed they be use all the tax payer money
augur well for farmer
seriously feel sorry for our farmer these police staff be so ignorant food you eat come from these farmer at least listen to them shame on modi govt and midi medium
you have absolutely no idea about the intricacy of the protest who be involve in them and what they want even after be call for discussion the only thing the protester be demand be completely repeal the law without cite reason even when the law fundamentally provide all the benefit previously available to farmer and a scope to sell their produce outside mandis
it funny and sad at the same time that during modis reelection he align himself with indian nationalist and turn a blind eye willfully to the murder and persecution of the muslim minority in india and now look at him sponsor a bill that be now law that hurt farmer and the majority moldy and netanyahu need to go

this protest be very important to save little left democracy of india sometimes you need this kind of protest to awake the people and to make deaf hear bjp start to think that they can make any law any time a nobody be gon na oppose them
i can understand india be government want to modernize it be agriculture sector an average of one person manage only 3 acre of land be crazy inefficient by modern standard it also tie up a great deal of the nation work force in just agriculture i understand why they would be upset they have all live this way for a long time and change creates uncertainty for a lot of those farmer future and ask a lot of them but it seem that if standard of living be go to improve in india something will need to change
corporates work for profit but profit do not always mean exploitation itc start e choupal for lower their procurement cost but it benefit farmer as well in the present world a good relationship be well for business in the long term itc be do that

thank you mr amit your video be very informative you very well explain all the detail about various act i will be highly oblige to you if you can answer a query of mine in the first 8 you say that there be a legal bond of trade between the farmer and the and the price set so be there any standardized grading protocol for the commodity
6 there be also old rule like only a farmer can buy land thus people like sharad pawar lalu prasad can keep buying land but people who have settle in city can not return to their root buy land farm because of this rule if you leave village and come to city and one generation pass then they can not buy farm land in village
support the farmer by bring these law the previous law be a direct reason why 30 farmer suicide every day i hope the police and government take strict action against the thug endanger the peace by protest we need privatization enough of corrupt mandi system
