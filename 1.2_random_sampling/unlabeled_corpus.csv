Bobin Kumar,With Hundreds of thousands of farmers suicides in the past two decades .and no new reform too. At last some effort from the ruling party with new reform.and the opposition parties has to oppose it as they are in the opposition. Interesting is even our media who prefer add fuel rather than a corrective force .some good suggestions than misleading the farmers if any bothered there life's or livelihood.

Mr.X,"State:- UP
Police image:- Very corrupt
Party :- BJP
Date:- 26 January, 2021
Aim :- Insulting National Flag
Result:- Protesters not able to enter Delhi. UP police throws them away


State:- National Capital territory of New Delhi
Police image :- Normal
Party :- AAP
Date:- 26 January 2021
Aim :- Insulting National Flag 
Result:- Success

Can u think y?
That is the difference between Lotus and Broom ( jaadu) Delhi police isn't corrupt n no police is corrupt. The difference was that UP police was ordered to throw anybody destroying public property and Delhi police was not allowed to do anything except watch becuse opposition wanted to spoil BJP name"
Upen,"As a democratic country we have no issues with protests it's people's right to keep their word and keep there stand but DISRESPECTING COUNTRY'S FLAG, PUBLIC PROPERTY, POLICE FORCE AND PUTTING UP A RELIGIOUS FLAG IN A SECULAR COUNTRY IS UNACCEPTABLE these cannot be the real farmers of our country. SUPPORT OPINIONS AND RIGHTS NOT RIOTS"
Souperduk,"I now question sincerity of this, and BLM protests that became violent in the UK and the US. I never supported BLM hearing the original story that started the movement and wont either in the future. I supported the kisan movement due to the bills and their lack of support for kisans. However seeing the protests turn violent makes weakens my support. Real farmers are like my uncle. Lives in Punjab, has animals to look after and crops to tend to when not winter. Isnt concerned about stuff that wont directly impact his life. He doesnt have time for this. He knows if he goes to protest, no one tends to his animals. My cousin also lives in punjab, has no animals. He also has Nothing to do cuz its too cold anyway for crops. My cousin also takes money from my dad living in the UK and is a freeloader who went to protest. I have little sympathy for my cousin. My uncle has my sympathy but doesnt need it; his crops and animals feed his entire family and he still has plenty left over. Jai hind and happy belated republic day my fellow Indians . From a UK born punjabi who loves India to bits :)."

Wion should have kept the public up to date on the farmer's tension. 
The farmers have every right, as they work hard 360 to keep us healthy and alive.
Modi should have asked, not tell the farmer's what to do.
Modi is trying the "" who gives up first "" game
The farmers should stay put and ignore modi new law.
Modi wants the farmer's to become a money pit for corporate company's. 
Hold your ground farmer's the world backs you all."

I request the Indian Government to take strict actions against them as applicable for traitors. Democracy and free speech are the most basic rights of every Indian, but no true Indian has the right to misuse those rights, and never will they do so... those who do (leftists/extremist pacifiers/extrimists.tukde tukde gang etc.) are not Indians, but enemies/ traitors within, trying to break our Nation since independence, at the top is the entire pappu/congress gang... enough of this.. India needs to take strict actions against them now.."

Sindhu border is not there home,they have other things to do 

India is a country where people just ignore. they don't support each other. farmers were protesting in cold winters, what did the government do???? They just ignored them as if everything is normal

It was huge mass of mad men that were raging mercilessly with swords, lathis and weapons attacking at policemen making it impossible for Delhi police to manage.

Greg,"This Political trouble seems to have started once Bill Gates got involved. It sounds like they are Forcing deregulation so that foreign entities can come in and take control of the farms while leaving the farmers hanging out to dry. Either way, Bill Gates is right that Indian farms produce 20% Per acre what American farmers do. If huge farm start becoming five times more efficient, that will crater prices big time. The farmers that have fed all of India for hundreds of years need to have a soft landing And Provisions made for their children. That way the people benefit from low prices and the farmers are taken care of. But It sounds like greedy government officials are just trying to throw these poor farmers out On the streets because they are too greedy or lazy to work them into the solution"
Greg,"If they stock up then supply will drop and prices will rise for remaining stock. Maybe the stock can later be used to crash prices, but the slick infographic makes none of that obvious. It sounds like vox is manipulating the viewer to think what they want us to  think "

Ganesh Ravisankar,"3:53 Umm yeah just so you know, it's what you call economic growth; starting in the '80s, there was a surge in secondary and tertiary sectors which contributed to a larger percentage of the GDP, thereby decreasing the overall contribution of agriculture to the GDP percentage-wise. Also, the agricultural sector clocked in 9.5% growth in FY19.

Another thing - most of the small farmers were already being exploited by the bigger farmers since these 'bigger' farmers were buying crops at a price lower than the MSP. The point of this law was to provide a path for the smaller farmers to sell their crop directly to the wholesalers which would guarantee them a better price than if they had sold it to these 'bigger' farmers. It's about giving the smaller farmers more agency over the price that they receive for their crops. This is a two-way argument; you can't talk about one side and ignore the other."

Soorya Ganesh,"The farm laws could also benefit farmers too, it can increase farmers incomes, get rid of corruption from middle men, give them a larger market,and it further liberates them, and most of the points in the farmer bills were suggested by farmer unions before, and there are plenty of farmers and unions who support the laws.
The farmers get to directly do trade deals with private ownerships without middle men so they won't be scammed by middle men, and also they would be able to settle the prices for their own goods,and they will obviously settle for higher prices than what they get from the msp system, hence making them richer. Most global economists have supported the move as well. Most political parties in India promised to bring similar reforms as well because it was suggested by farmer unions themselves. The Congress govt promised to bring similar reforms in their 2019 election manifesto,but now  they have taken a uturn and are against the laws for some reason. China implemented similar laws in the 60s and their farmers became richer, Israel as well, and also the US. And if farmers work with private ownerships agricultural tech could become better in the country,which could simplify and solve a lot of farmers problems. I find it funny that Greta is against the laws. The laws criminalizes stubble burning, a major source of pollution in the country, so it can reduce pollution,isn't she a climate activist?"
Aviation,I hope farmers get the justice they deserve!
Past,I didnt understand what was happening first when it was showed in local news but u explained it to me
The Royalty Edits,"So basically the Modi has set new laws to which the farmers disagree with, those new laws restrict farmers from making money meaning they cant live their normal life.They cant pay the bills or put money on the table family so of course they start to protest. Not only farmers but the whole world is protesting. No farmers no food "
Avanish Awade,"Fast forward today, there has been a spike in the registered overall production of wheat and rice in Punjab and Haryana.....not because of the Farm Laws isn't it? No, because the Opposition parties are in power in these states......So I wonder how?....."
Rohith Sharma,this video is all of lies and misinformation based on speculation
Sandeep Goud,"One question is still unanswered, why is it only Punjab & Haryana farmers having issue with this bill not the other farmers from various remaining states. No farmers from down south is supporting this movement, why so? Did Vox look into this corner? Journalism needs to see things from hawk eye and need to also take interview from the leaders why did they bring this bill. No government will bring in a new policy just to do injustice to its agricultural industry. I some how feel the whole moment is been misinterpreted to the world by creating ciaos. If the bill is so unjustifiable then it would get condemned by people across entire nation then the government will rethink on its decision. But here I find many rich people from Punjab and Haryana who own mandis have problems. They now don't want to share their abundant income with states like Bihar and rest who are not fortunate to taste the cream."
kaceo brwa,"in a country of 1.3 B people nobody is protesting, only some people from Punjab are protesting, i live in Kerala here farmers are supporting the decision may be because Kerala has the highest literacy rate"

The Health Kitchen,"The new farmer's law eliminates middle men, the money goes directly to farmers so the rich middlemen who controlled the price and got very very rich have issue. The protests are paid drama by those rich middlemen who will lose money."
Jeet Jeet,They're antisocial 
The Health Kitchen,"India has more than 27 states and multiple union territories. Strange that only 1  state, which is rules by opposition is protesting the new farmer's laws while rest all states, many which are ruled by other parties are very happy with these new reforms. Check the propoganda beyond the headlines"
Galeon Jomar,Everything is politic manipulations against the Indian government.
Nikunj Papnejja,"2:16 open auctions with transparent pricing this is the whole issue. Neither the auctions are open nor the pricing transparent. The arthias (dealers) group up in each mandi and decide a common highest bid, above which no other arthia will go. Ground reality is very different then theory. The arthias are bullies. And their is no real oversight in the mandis. The people who are meant to actually overlook the functioning of mandi and protect the farmers do the exact opposite. They team up with the arthias or more precisely, they issue the arthia license only to their family members/relatives to gain monopoly over the market."
Ankhi Soorma,"Fraud protest led by opposition parties and foreign agents. Women are molested there, they have goons and rioters there who also vandalised Red Fort. All pendu goons. Not farmers"
Vidhaat Raman,Today marks the 6th month of these protests.
Raj Brar,"India is a very complex system where the middle class enjoy cheap food prices and farmers receive low prices for their crop as they currently are not allowed to store crop, pay high prices for inputs and don't have the ability to protect themselves with futures contracts. The current system in India is not sufficient to support all the small farmers in India (they lack the scale to produce, store and market their own products). A free market can only work, which these bills seek to do, if both buyers and sellers have equal bargaining power. Smaller farmers are not only lacking the skill but also the knowledge to effective participate in a free market. They free they will be crushed under low prices. The government should offer assistance and compensate for farmers harmed by these laws until the economy normalized. India need to grow beyond having millions of small farmers and the farmers need to accept their faith but I think the government did not do a good job in marketing these bills. Also, the people of Punjab are well off farmers compared to rest of India. If you look at the number of children being sent outside from Punjab to study in college, you would understand why punjabis are at the heart of the protest. They enjoy the highest income in the country from farming. Any threat to their lifestyle would bring about a reaction. Many of those protesting have on name brand clothes, Nike, Adidas, and drive Audis. These aren't the lowly farmers of Bihar."
Treato Please,"It saddens me how people are misunderstanding this. The so called ""Farmers"" left months ago as they started to realize that the law is for their own BENEFIT!!! The people left are not farmers but people related to politics DISGUISED as farmers. Please dont believe lies. The famrers only will benefit by removing the middleman! And This is coming from a guy born in farmer family"
kotha venkat,"Farmers are actually ill informed on these laws. We educted indian who see these videos are also ill informed . We should try to understand the laws first. these laws are actually very good for farmers all across the country. for example it was mentioned there is no limit for stocking the produce, but this thing was only for horticulture produce. it was mentioned that all the prices of the trade will be electronic which is good for every. People should come out of thier old thinking and should understand the laws better."

Michael Leonard Setyawijaya_22,India growing population
Shubham Negi,Nice of you to not mention most of the protestors are rice farmers from Punjab and Haryana that only grow it for it's higher MSP.
amarender reddy jali,"And mandis are already dead in most part of India....people will sell to highest price outside market albeit illegally...and some states noticed and gave up on mandi and deregulated it ......now this laws will give big foreign companies or conglomerate who can invest in the storages ,facilities transportation and also help in contracting out the farmers at good prices and offer help in modernization of agriculture....."
amarender reddy jali,Contracts with pepsi and other agro businesses will improve the overall agri chain ...u see farmers will get better seeds...minimum insurance amount....and more profitable farm products........indian farmers are stuck with rice and wheat when are they gonna experimnet on cultivating different products...that might grow in india....and which are profitable......when a company approcahes a farmer to cultivate say avocados in india....the company bores the research and  risk of the crop failure .....and if the crop is a sucess in india....do u think neighborhood farmers would sit still...they would also grow avocados.....a new product in market and one more choice to farmer
amarender reddy jali,If mandis  collaps themselves beacuse farmers are going to unregulated spaces to trade does that mean market economy is working and  mandis offering price is lower than free market price...then collapse of the mandi is good....
Varun Bhaaskar,"Actually yesterday in Punjab, 131.14 lakh tonnes of wheat has been procured, which is an all-time record. I think your video doesn't cover the entire situation precisely. There have been multiple talks between the farmers and the government. The government is ready to make changes to the law. But the farmers are adamant that they will only accept abolishing of the laws. The entire situation is very complex and hard to understand! Also when you are reporting some numbers, you should take the covid situation as well into account!"
अतुल शर्मा,Indian democracy well explained. Other countries will not allow take them another breath.
Utkarsh Kumar,"The government's main approach is to cut off the various 'Middle-Men' links that exists in the country because the supplies are reguated at least twice before reaching the City or town markets.The different tiers of middle men create their own profit which indeed exploits the original prices  which is earned by the farmers,if the laws will cut out these men then most probably farmers can earn better prices but the implementation sparkled protests because many of these farmers who are out here protesting are themselves part of local trade links or have not clearly understood the government's plan.Also I personally think it's because the Congress political party has funded Punjab farmers(as Punjab is a congress State and the party have influence there) to simply defame BJP central Government and as you can see the protesters are all Punjabis and not even a single person can be seen who is not Punjabi."

khushbu merchant,"Vox: what about the other states where MSP isnt there anymore or trades are happening outside of mandis - apart from Bihar how are they doing?  What has been the time period since the MSP is laid out? What kinds of model exists in world wherein agri sectors who are heavily dependent on government subsidies can work towards being independent? What is the cost of protection provided to farmers in terms of tax payers money? What is happening to the grains taken by FCI and stored which are procured from farmers on MSP and than sold to poor people (most are farmers and farm labours and other labours) at PDS systems for extremely low price?

They're just a burden on common man's life. This is just cheap politics by Rakesh trying to be a CM and I suggest they clear out before UCC is passed on August 5th this year, when 20 crore peacefuls will start the biggest protest in human history."

Suresh Bhave,"It is surprising that, while recognising the right of the general public to use public raodways, the SC does not positively order the protestors to vacate the highway. The SC knows that negotiations have reached a dead end because the protestors want the withdrawal of farm laws to prove that BJP government is spineless. Therefore, why does SC not stand by the general public and order the protestors to vacate the highway?"

If KISSAN are fighting the INDIAN CORPORATE system they are called Deshdrohi.

All planned  BJP Think tank  Hired few people to do this unacceptable act at Lal Qila. It will divert nations attention from ARNAB WhatsApp chat , fail the Kissan Andolen & defame one particular community.

Now they will charge Kissan community with many charges & FIRs. Will they think to punish all the coward people who planned 83 massacre, Babri Masjid killings, Godara incident & many many acts of gundagardi.

Riya,"Hello sir, 
The flag hoisted at Red Fort isn't a Khalistani Flag, it is called Nishan Sahib and the National Flag was not removed from anywhere, Nishan Sahib was placed on an empty pole near Red fort entrance. At some UP Election Rally BJP lotus was placed above the National Flag. I dont know why every media house have covered what happened at ITO, defaming farmers for hoisting Nishan Sahib but these people have been out there, barely surviving this harsh weather conditions for over two month patiently and peacefully protesting now, many died no one really cared, tricked by DL Police and remain unheard by our country's media houses, politicians. A ground report from the channel @scoopwhoopunscripted is seen covering the eye witnesses statement where they admit to have seen DL Police damaging DTC Buses and blaming these on farmers (10AM-11AM). 
Whatever happened was not right, but completely blaming farmer and calling them anti-national is ALSO NOT  right This is the same DL Police which attacked STUDENTS sitting in JMI Library. Everyone here knows how the bill was made, passed. Mending things/ situations according to their comfort and sensibility just bc they are in power. Cheers to Republic day."

Shaider Riz,"Modi wants Bharat to be a Hindu Estate: So let it be. Let Khalistan come into being, let Kashmir come into being , let Asam come into being; and let Nagaland come into being: What is left over is Modi's Hindu Veresh: Enjoy. What is the problem with that. Modi is a Pakistani Agent: He has more sympathy with the late mother of Nawaz Sharif than those 140 Farmers died because of the severe weather sitting in the Andolan. Shame of this type of treatment. Farmers are Andata, they are not Atanwad: But Modi has treated them as terrorist. Modi must be removed from the power and must be trialed to get a sentence of death or let Bharat be divided into 5 parts. That is the end of this RSS Terrorist hijacked Bharat and created a situation of hatred and marginalization: against the policies of Nahro, and Ghandi. This is the start of the movement of Khalistan. Now it is out of control. Jai Kisan; Jai Jawan: Jai Khalistan: is what I have been hearing from the participents of this rally."

Nankana is the birthplace of Guru Nanak the founder of Sikhism. So, for how long will our homeland keep calling us??? Come on brave brothers let us move back home to Lahore, Pakistan. Forget India. Lets go OUR REAL, HISTORICAL, GURU-GRANTED HOME: LAHORE, PAKISTAN. RAJ KAREGA KHALSA. I repeat, brave Sikh brothers, let us never forget that the real home of Sikhs granted by our Guru and the capital of sher-e punjab is Lahore and not India. Indian Punjab belongs to Punjabi, Bihari, Madrasi and all Indians but Lahore belongs to Sikhs alone."

Akshay M,"This video is nothing but a classic example of fear mongering.
All this video is talking about is, this would have happen in future, this may be happen.
But nothing decisive.
The only farmers who are protesting are from Punjab and Haryana who are fat rich, many are having crores of turnover.
U gave a example of jio.
Yes jio rises there prices, but they are not selling 1GB Data for 134 rupee like Airtel doses.
Only because of JIO today all the telecom player's are reasonable in there prices.
And yes is government is not managing correctly they have to go away.
Ex:- Ordinance factory board 100% govt, is only able to fulfill 53% of its orders from past 3.5 decades, due to their faulty animation and equipment 1000's of crores of loss is taken place.
So don't make a video tomorrow what wrong with government for corporatizing OFB."

Rishabh Pandey,"It is very fruitful fot all the farmers,  they are not going to lose any rights even they will get more options of selling "

India has to grow and become self sufficient and for that, every Indian should become self-dependent so that the government does not have to waste the hard earned tax money and rather utilize on the development of the country. Although, I am not a very big fan of BJP's economic adventures, but I can really say that this bill is extremely visionary. It will get better over time. Great job!"

Tp Singh,Most of the comment makers seem to be too far from reality of  rural India.
K Singh,"Ok, let's say we agree. Then what is the government going to do about the poor people who can't afford to eat onions or potatoes, is the government going to hand out free food to them or have some  kind of benefit system in place? What ever way you look at it, a problem will be created in the future. Maybe look at a solution that will help all parties. Why not let the farmers sell directly to the retail industry as well and see how it works out, but still keeping the same conditions as going through the market."

Dr Pinaki Sengupta,"You have told only half of the facts, and that too only Govt side's. The main contentions of farmers that is why they are objecting is not properly and not completely discussed."
Nafee Nafa,"In the non- perishable and perishable goods there is a 50%, 100% limit in increasing.Did they mention the base level price of these commodities. I am confused because the market is fluctuating and there is no exact price on any product."
Dawit Ketema,"Only the cronies will profit from a highly regulated environment. When are we going to learn that most price hikes are artificial, mainly caused by government policy measures purportedly aimed at resolving some problem but having the opposite effect. 
Likewise, we can bring thousands of examples of how price controls failed in many countries, not to mention how it also bred corruption. 
If India has the capacity to build an effective regulatory framework, then it can function better by liberalizing the economy and and let the market decide."

Balvinder Gill,"In India: 20 corporates own 70% of wealth.
In America,: 20 corporates own 25% of wealth."
Balvinder Gill,"Farmers are protesting because they understand the REALITY of these bills - not the fancy language!
- no more Mandees.
-only I Biyer - Adani: monopoly... Jio!!
-no right to courts, only SDMs
-contract farming!!!
- Adani dictates what to grow and how. Gives seed and pesticides and decides what price he will pay to farmer based on Adanis decision on quality
- farmer responsible foe any loans etc taken ... risk of bankruptcy theough the tax laws (INDIRECTLy).
- farmers will loose everything indirectly through these laws.
All farmers will become indentured labourers.
of all people involved in farming, including labourers and those who sell produce, only10% will remain employed - where is government going to give jobs to 90% of those that will become e UNemployed?
Since government will not be buying produce from farmers (because Adani/Albanian will), how will government fulfill its atta/daal scheme to the poor???

Do you think ALL the Delhi Bar Assoxoation and other Supreme Court layers who are standing with the farmers do NOT u sweat and the danger of these 3 laws?????"

This video was in December 2020 and now it's September 2021. You said it's 15 days farmers are protesting and you hoped that government would make necessary changes to the bills in 5-7 days.
Only because of the arrogance, govt is not amending the bills, farmers are still protesting.... news media is sold completely... they have stopped showing farmers."

Kapil Sharma,I don't know why but this will prove to a boon for farmers!
nirav mehta,sir I have one question if you can highlight this I.e if the private players enter in the market and slowly gradually Mandis get closed because of less buying because farmers will try to avail maximum price from private players in such case the chances of. Hoardings and over pricing by private players can be observed so in that case the commodities price will increase so what you suggest one that
DHYNA SA,"Whether we agree or not with the laws, the presentation is superb."
Hardik Doshi,"I feel that this reformed agriculture bill proposed by Gov. needs some changes & amendments to ENSURE that our most diligent & hardworking farmer brothers get their truly deserving  rewards:

1) Need to define the Regulated framework where Government will oversee & monitor the Contract farming deal presented by Private Entity.

2) Government need to formulate the law & create the framework which ENSURES that farmer should be funded with the promised amount as per the contract.

3) If any Private company tries to BACKOUT from the promised price then need to frame laws to suspend their functioning license. Such that way strict laws will PROTECT our hardworking farmer community.

Farmers WERE, ARE & WILL BE the foundational & core asset of Indian Economy. So need to focus on empowering  & prospering our farming community to see the strong economy & growth of India  on the global platform.

Jai Jawan Jai Kisan"
Pankaj Nirban,"Farmer's can sell to anybody and anywhere in existing system also, if farmer wants to sell on MSP only then he has to go to APMC  near your area.
And please don't discuss clarification while discussing laws because it confuses, clarification has came later after protest.

Biggest question is why government is limiting it's role and voiceing private sectors concerns through farmers, Government = less profit, more charity, private = more profit and no charity. So why government is putting something so essential  into "" free market"" ""private players"" can't goverment regulate the whole system."

rahul banik,"Yeah small farmers will be at the mercy of big corporates. But in a world when 84% of the farmers are not even able to access the MSP. At least a contract between the farmer and the corporate will have a legal framework where in the farmer will be protected by the MSP , as such the corporates can never put a price that is below the MSP.  At least, this will ensure all farmers receive a MSP."
Saravana Chandra Kumar,"Farmers will benifit, but common people will have to spend a lot. govt ll not educate the farmers"
AAYUSHI AYUSHI,"govt is already organising many workshops at ground level and providing all helps through internet and dd kisan is a channel where they teach a lot of techniques for better farming, Also many poor and uneducated farmers have in recent times emerged with new farming techniques and have increased their income. So where is the government lacking or can we say that indian farmer chooses to remain unaware and a subject to traders' and moneylenders' pity?"

E.g potatoes  you produced 1kg = 10 rupees"
Sunil Gokhale,"I really thank you for keeping this lecture non-political. We should implement new farm laws, however, it's important to ensure the farmers are fully aware of their rights and benefits."
Sunil Gokhale,"wonderfully explained....I hope all the so-called educated people should first understand the farm laws prior taking any political view. Going forward, it's important to make farmers aware of their rights and other facilities provided to them. However, it can be seen that current protests are certainly not achieving that."

But, I have a doubt.

If the APMC ACT, 2003 were adopted by 15 states only. That means the states had the right to choose, whether to adopt the act  or not.

So how will APMC act 2020 will be automatically applicable to all the states?

Will the states not get an option to adopt the act?

Thanks."

Shievam Shreyas,"New farm bills are more vulnerable to monopoly. Atleast when you know that there is no limit on hoarding when there should be. Also like you said that the products are perishable in nature. Hoarding only helps them exploit the producers/farmers even more. For eg a product with MSP of Rs 100 for once is purchased at Rs 120 resulting in maximum produce and sale, let's say twice the actual demand. The remaining produce can be hoarded and in the next season, traders/buyers can either refuse to buy newer products or ask them farmers to sell the same products at a half price. Because of their perishable nature, farmers wouldn't have other options but to agree. Also the potential players will be very limited and an open market saying is just a gimmick because in the beginning, the products will be purchased at lucrative prices which have never been offered earlier, at prices which cannot be paid by others, even with taking huge losses on the account of buyers, to kill a potential competition like it happened in the case of Jio. Even Idea and Vodafone failed to survive. Which other buyer can take losses as much as Adani in the agriculture sector? Anyone? And then when the competition is dead, there's no MSP to protect farmer's interests, mandis will close down eventually as they'd largely remain non-functional because of a better deal from the Pvt buyers in the beginning like it happened with BSNL. We already have seen such market disasters in the recent times, don't we learn anything from it? How can farmers survive an exploitative monopoly which even Idea and Vodafone couldn't survive? APMCs are atleast in the interest of farmers, New farm bills actually make the producers/farmers most vulnerable. In APMCs, traders license is given to those who are close to state Govts and the Govts keep changing thus keeping the cycle running. Open markets with no law for MSP, unlimited hoarding and with giants like Adani it's just delusional to expect a fair business taking place even in an open market. This monopoly is worse by a 100 miles when compared to the conventional system of APMCs.

These laws with a few changes made in the interest of farmers as is their demand can be revolutionary and can bring an end to these protests but currently they're more deadly than anything in a long run, both for consumers and farmers."

Supi Mon,"10:47 you point out how certain situations within the parliament proceedings can be challenged in the apex court
11:09 and you are contradicting your earlier point !
So before you go on to claim that the supreme court cannot interfere, it needs to be clarified as to what activities within the parliament can be termed unconstitutional, illegal or irregular. 
For e.g. an activity like destroying the mic - is unconstitutional and illegal because the mic installed in the upper house was not paid by the idiots who destroyed it, rather it was paid by the tax payer's money - our money - entire nation's money.  
would you for e.g. destroy the traffic lights just because they are dysfunctional and allow more time for one direction? 

Without doubt, the matter should have been challenged in supreme court. 

SIDE NOTE: Sadly as we grow older, we understand the political system better. We realise that the supreme court doesn't function on its own. The judiciary in the country come under the influence of the centre (the election of chief justice for e.g.) It is very important that the centre have their own people in position of high power to seamlessly run the country during their term. This is true for any govt and is true for all major posts like CBI chief, RAW chief, IAS official (this is why you see a lot of transfers and forced retirements as soon as a new govt takes over)"

Hardik Doshi,"I feel that this reformed agriculture bill proposed by Gov. needs some changes & amendments to ENSURE that our most diligent & hardworking farmer brothers get their truly deserving  rewards:

1) Need to define the Regulated framework where Government will oversee & monitor the Contract farming deal presented by Private Entity.

2) Government need to formulate the law & create the framework which ENSURES that farmer should be funded with the promised amount as per the contract.

3) If any Private company tries to BACKOUT from the promised price then need to frame laws to suspend their functioning license. Such that way strict laws will PROTECT our hardworking farmer community.

Farmers WERE, ARE & WILL BE the foundational & core asset of Indian Economy. So need to focus on empowering  & prospering our farming community to see the strong economy & growth of India  on the global platform.

5. Online GPS network for all government and private warehouses with transparent capacities, costs and facilities like nitrogen chambers and dehumidifiers. Here also every farmer can put a price tag including warehousing fees for off-seasonal revenues.

Raghu P,"But govt assured that the APMC will always be there and MSP will always be provided there, APMC will never be shutdown, its farmers choice to go outside and explore more options or to go to APMC, just like BSNL is there along with other private telecom operators to regulate the telecom tariff, My father is a farmer from karnataka, he is very hardworking person, we grow paddy, here from 40 years what i am observing is only the middlemen and millers are benefitting from our crops, after working so hard and investing so much on labour's and pesticides, facing natural calamities, labour problems, water problems, machinery problems, new type diseases in the crops and all, what we are earn is just to accommodate our basic needs of food, cloths, bike thats it, forget our hardwork, sometimes we won't get back our investment also, present crop cutting done in this dec month is a complete loss for all paddy growers here, yield reduced very drastically due to new virus in our crops just like covid on humans, we not made any property from past 40 years, we don't get any thought of making some property with that earnings, just life goes on with hardworking forever, so something to be done to benefit the farmers, all these days only businessmans, middlemens are having decent earnings and making properties everywhere, small farmers fate remains same even after another 50years until unless if something is done now, our country is developing means everyone of us should develop, everyone be a part of it, only few sector people are developing is not a whole development of the country, these farm bills are not a big news here in South India or at least in our locality,  big protests and all happening there in North India, I doubt does farmers really able to understand these farm bills properly, mostly some opposition parties, middlemens and others who are benefitting now are having knowledge to understand these bills and its impacts and to safeguard their earnings in future they are provoking farmers with false predictions to protest against those bills, I trust our PM Modi like our family head, he never do anything harmful to the farmers or any other sector hardworking people, he doesn't have intentions to earn something by supporting corporates bcz he not even have children's to earn for them, treats all of us as his children's,  these farm bills are actually beneficial to the farmers and consumers except those middlemens, initially there may be some loopholes, bcz everything can't set right on one go, it will take some time to block all loopholes,  later definitely will have good future in the farm sector also"

santosh kumar,"Farmers carry seeds and fertilizer . Farmers don't carry Swords, Iron rods, Stones . Only rioters and hooligans carry Swords, Iron rods, Stones .

1. The three farm bills are already in place and working fine as of now 
and they are part of congress , bjp, ncf parties 2019 election manifesto.
ex farmer minister of ncp and present congress chief minister of punjab also 
supported the same reforms in the past. Now all oppositon parties change their stand and making farmers scape goat.

2. post dialogue with farmers and govt ,On december 9th clarified with 10 point 
amendment
 that all the doubts farmers posed and will be tabled in next session of
 parliament. But protesting farmers unions change stand after dec 9th 
and want full repeal.

3.  In 2019 farmers can't sell their 
produced rice/wheat/vegetables etc out side of the district or county 
and cant sell to any one outside of the APMC market yards/mandis and 
farmer has to pay 8.5 percent fees( 3% to market yard improvement, 3% to
 district development , 2.5% to licensed commision agents). In some 
markets they collect both  from seller and buyer each 8.5% . These new 
2020 farm laws allows farmers to sell  to any where in india to any one .
 no restriction. It is upto local government to  charge needed cess or 
fees.

4. In 2019 only 10% of total agriculture produce (mainly 
wheat and rice)was bought by government agency FCI (Food Corporation of 
India as a stockpile for emergeny security) . 85% was purchased by 
private buyers . In 2019 only 15% of produce of total agriculture was 
purchased at minimum support price (MSP) and rest was purchased at lower
 price. Till 2010 the minimum support price was lower than the 
international price of the goods. After 2010 the minimum support price 
was increased higher than international price and no exporter is
buying at msp except govt agency and all godowns of FCI agency are full with 4.5 trillion tonnes of wheat and rice .

5. who is at loss due to this farm bills of 2020 are 


   A. punjab state governments who charge 3% cess for district 
developement will loose around 15000 millions  (1500 crores) indian 
rupees per year income.  

   B. the punjab licensed commision agents (who are mainly punjabi sikh jat caste landlords )who get 2.5% 
charge  per transaction thro markets will loose 1000 crores (10000 
million) rupees per year only in punjab state.

   c. Other than punjab and haryana no other state charge district fees and market cess 
and they charge only commision agent fees. Some states there are no 
markets/mandis like in kerala (since 1980) and bihar (since 2008).

6.  The funding for protest is happening by charging 500 rupees per farmer .
 80% farmers own only less than 2 hectres /5 acre land.

7. The foreign punjab seperatist/secissionist group sikh for justice announced 1
 millon dollars as donation and indian banks stoped the 
   distribution asking account holder to show FCRA ( Foreign control regulatory) registrants for permission

8. All want farm reforms. Punjab and Haryana farmers unions want to repeal
 and rest of indian country farmers  are happy that they can sell 
anywhere. I think if central/union govt gives that 1500 crores to punjab
 govt per year and 1000 crore to punjab commision agents it will stop.
 
 9. In 2021 january govt gave a option to protesting farmers union that it will hold the laws till 2 years until 
 joint committe of farmers and govt will finalize the law clauses that will benefit farmers or not. But unions are adament."

Policy & Cooking Gas Given , Bank Accounts Under Jana Dhan Youjna Opened , Light Given,Water Given & Subsidised Seeds & Minures As Well As Keetnashaks Given And Double Income Is Assured By The Govt.Now This Is Not Liked By The Middlemen As Well As By The Opposition Political Parties Of The Country As They All Are Anti Nationals Thinking And Wants Profits For Own Pockets.
This Middle Men Are Thrown Away By Govt.Policy & Ordinance.MSP Is Guarenteed By The Govt.

Amit kumar,Sir you need to elaborate more.. most of states doesn't follow mandi concept
Gupta Pr,"Respected Sir, In-depth analysis"
Gurpreet Singh Bhinder,"Sir.. ground reality of present protest is..the MSP is not included in New policy... farmers want it should be added in writing not verbal ..on TV channels... Govt has refused to purchase MAKEE at MSP rate of 1600 per quintal..fixed by govt..says... farmers r free to cell elsewhere....tpt cost will boost... further pvt. agencies are not ready pay more than 600 per quintal for Makee against MSP of 1600/- Farmers say..either govt purchase MAKEE at MSP or order pvt. agencies to purchase at MSP.
During lockdown Punjab n Haryana has supplied foodgrains to whole country...appx. 75% foodgrains these two states cater..overthat hike in diesel and electricity has made the poor farmers more vulnerable. Poor farmers are not tech savvy to sell their produce...if govt helps them then it may become easy...

Purwansh Singh,Instead of protesting against government if farmers unite and bargain with traders that would be much better for them
iam groot,"Why don't you guys directly support the rulling party,its fully biased video! Why don't you are making the video on GDP, unemployment, Secularism, hate speech!
Many other things to highlight! How farmers could believe the ruling party what is the guaranty that capitalists will support them, PM itself make statements before elections now he also forget that! Have some shame! Support ruling party directly"
RINKU GHOSH,i understood these bills are good...but all depends on measures taken and implementation...
JMG JAMMI,"Farmers Bill's are very dangerous to Farmers and for the public of India tooo, plz dnt act like BJP dhallal try to study the bills properly and try to post  u can speak anything, the 1 who does farm work will know the actual value and actual pain "
Jyoti Ranjan,Go to ground and check all facts about farmers then give your so called opinion.
saurabh tripathee,Suppose a company contracted with you for 100 kg of tomato of 3 inch radius if u r not able to provide them with there specification they will recover their input by aquiring your land
saurabh tripathee,The contract is decided on the size or quality of the product if they (whoever is contracting) dont find the product according to their need they wont give the agreed price there is no cover for flood or drought
Akramul Mazid,"Truth is, there are a ton of loopholes in these laws and when corporations are involved they exploit each and every loophole to the fullest (just look the the NPS, process of approving loans are exploited by corporations). Another reason to consider is that we cannot let the food market to be a monopoly/designed monopoly or duopoly( in US telecom companies carve out area so that they can maintain monopoly, indian food corporations might do the same). Ultimately the entire nation has a lot to lose if these laws fail to protect the farmers as well as consumers."

SAKSHI AND TAANYA,"Congress party is not at all bothered about either our country or welfare of it's people .Their only motive is politics.  Whatever BJP does to uplift the country ,Congress only wants to oppose it because they want to spoil the image of BJP for next election. Those who support Congress are also equally responsible."
Sudhanshu Taneja,"Truely biased.
Not even critical of govt. On any point."
Rohit Singh,"If u r not aware, then don't make a video on it. Because u have zero practical knowledge , beacause  Punjab and Haryana is the highest producers of wheat and rice and they have a MSP to to sell at. No one bargains in the mandis , because the msp is there in Punjab and Haryana.,one more thing this kind of law are already failed in some developed countries like France . So first equipped yourself with the practical knowledge then make a video on any topic."
Tripti Mondal,Great
I am so hell Vlogs,Chacha bas ek phone dur hai 
Bilesh Kadam,If corporate says I dont want to take tomato @20 then what farmer will do. Where as mandis  will get abolished in few years. Ubr talking about onion  what if only corporate hold the entire stock they will be able to manipulate price and supply  since they are the one who got stock.   MSP  is required as once again there will be monopoly.
shampakumari dasgupta,"1.Can you really justify about mandis by just showing one short 5 sec clip?? Would that represent whole of Indian mandis?? Really bro you're this low?? Lost respect for you
If bill is for good of farmers then why so many protests?

2. APMC sells much cheaper as compared to local market. Also we find direct farmers selling their crops.
3. Contract farming bill fail.
4. Hoarding vegetable bill fail.
5. You start video by saying no political perspective but you target congress.
6. A small farmer when can't go to local mandi how is he supposed to sell in other states?? How it is beneficial for farmers? 
7. How is the bill useful for farmers with such big loopholes?
8. Why Bill is passed so fast without opposition in parliament??
9. You talk about truth but you yourself don't abide by it
10. You talk about positive news but fact is(quoted by niyu) you just want to show things which are aligned with your ideologies and government
11. You put disclaimer about already making a decision but it seems it was cuz you knew there would be repercussions
12. if no politics then why bringing congress in between bro?
13. Also no talk about the way in which the bill was pushed? You talk about discussing but when asked government about discussing with farmers or oppositions they directly said they don't think that's needed because they have thought well about it. If they have then why so many loopholes bro?
14. you say loopholes are there but you need to figure that out then why not bring reforms in current one? Why make farmers vulnerable
15. You say 'logically think' but at end of video you support the bill inspite of yourself showing so many loopholes
16. Height of hypocrisy bro seriously hats off to you by running this propaganda channel"
Sukh Kharoud,There is a wide gap between ground reality and youtube lectures. Farmers are strong on ground and govt is debating on studies.
siddhanth kharat,Just get off you

nil null,"I think the problem could've been easily solved if the farmers were willing to talk on a point-to-point basis, and didn't directly demand the total deletion of these bills."
Sidakdeep Singh,The running system was doing good for the farmers. There was no need of these farm bills which the govt is imposing forcefully 
Sahejpal Singh Mangat,"To understand the role of Aarthiya in APMC system and rural India - existing system needs to be understood and studied. 
If Contract Farming is beneficial or a farmer gets better rates outside APMC without mandi tax and all - then why is bihar agriculture system staggering? 
Why no points on that?"

Bandita Raut,If MSP is not guaranteed for all crops and farmers are fine by it then govt should have it outside of mandis
shreya rishi,So Farmer Unions is the answer
S T,"Good video but does not explain everything. Abhi create one more follow up video with 3 parts with each part focusing on 3 issues on the bill. To understand the farm bill you need to understated the history of Indian agriculture for last 30 to 40 years. Most people putting comments were not even born then. P. Saianth  was invited by Supreme court  to be part of expert panel to resolve this issue. He declined the supreme court saying he would not want to be a ""party to death"" by any panel formed to resolve the crisis. He did that as he knows that the panel being formed wont do anything for farmers. It will be just like any other panels that have been formed before. If Supreme court invited him, he is qualified to speak on the issue. I suggest that you listen to him as he knows the history of Indian agriculture better than most of people.

tarun songra,"The major loop hole is >80% farmers are small and marginal. They can't sell their suff in bits and pieces. Private players are worst then middlemen we have seen in the video. Govt. should regulate the MRP.  My suggestive solution is:
1. MSP for all the farming goods (MSP should be more like x% of MRP). 
2. Middle men share is say some %
3. State and center government share shall be collected in GST. 

Seems tough task but not impossible."
meenakshi sharma,"You have missed out few points-
1. As farmers education background might not be enough to read contracts, government can add Single Contract for all through  technology BlockChain & it can be traded like stock & shares.
2. Government can form storage facility for farmer near their area, a token & price for facility can be provided to farmer this will avoid them to travel for a long distance. Government can be intermediary body to store their crop. 
3. Setting a price margin for min & max price a commodity can be sold.
4. Government has to procure these commodity to sell to common people & we can include a private companies/state body to procure these products from farmers sell in mandies because,  in India even common people & poor lives apart from Big MC D or Amul Company."
Krishna,I like your channel because you show truth not any unusual story
Puneetdoda007 Singh,"This model is already failed in uttarpradesh, bihar , USA, and many other developed countries .
You see the present miserable condition of up, bihar  farmers , then how the government say these bills beneficial for farmers"
faiyaz shaikh,In 2006 bihar government had shutdown the mandi system.... Now farmers of Bihar is selling wheat for 950/100kg whereas msp in punjab and haryana is 1850/100kg..hence farmers of Bihar is working as labourers in farm land of Punjab and Haryana...
faiyaz shaikh,Right now price of oil is 150 from 89 in October.... Effect of  essential commodities act amendment
Nishchay Sharma,They explained bills nicely while some other youtubers like Rathee who are biased by Kejriwal are misleading others. I am from Punjab and I completely agree that this bills are in favour of farmers . In Kerala and Bengal there are no APMC mandis still they are protesting.
G S,Not true. Most of the video is more for corporations point of view. 1000000 ok thousands farmers are not stupid who are protesting
G S,Not true because they can say your tomatoes are too ripe or etc . They can cancel their contract and Farmers cant even go to court.
Roseline Lepcha,Very interestingand easy to understand the reality of our country

Sanket Palwe,I think you should be The Agriculture Minister of India because you have all capabalities of it...
Amreen Kaur,"You both are wrong on quite a lot of points:
1. Farmers had the freedom to sell their produce anywhere in the country since 1976. This law did not give us that. In 1976, farmers did an agitation and high court removed the zonal restrictions in november 1976 giving farmers the freedom to sell their produce anywhere in the country whereas traders or to use your  words ""middleman"" didnt have that. This law gave that to these ""middleman"" and i quote""inter-State trade means the act of buying or selling of farmers produce,
wherein a trader of one State buys the farmersproduce from the farmer or a trader of
another State and such farmers produce is transported to a State other than the State
in which the trader purchased such farmers produce or where such farmers produce
originated;"". Hence no new freedom to farmers but a lot of freedom to traders.
2. In punjab and haryana Arhthiyas donot get very huge commissions. They get 4%comission here that is for every 1kg rice sold at msp of 18.50 rupees, they get comission of 85paise in which they have to unload the produce, clean it, weigh it, sell it and get the money back to the farmers. Arthiyas earn money here by lending money on a certain interest to the farmers. Thats their main source of income and not the comission from farmers. Rest of the states did not develop and regulate the mandi system like we did and hence farmers get exploited there.
3. Farmers nowhere in this country have to pay tax in the mandis. Its the traders who pay the tax for buying there. And that mandi tax has been used by punjab and haryana to develop the rural infrastructure. Difference between a village in punjab, haryana and states like bihar  where mandis have been abolished is quite evident. That mandi tax is quite important for the rural development.
Get your facts right before claiming to present people with the correct information."

Ashish Khobragade,Came across you guys recently!!!! You are doing a really great job. Developing well researched and objective content in the times of polarisation really contributes greatly. Keep up the good work. More power to both of you.
yash goyal,What are the historic disasters please looks like you also lost your cash and have to pay gst now.
yash goyal,But nowhere in the world any government gives or even assures minimum prices for any thing you make ( non agriculture ) so why should farmers get that benefit. Why are farmers growing wheat which is of lower variety just because they are assured of a price even for bad quality. Because the first buyer need to give pan number to the farmer/government  and then the black economy  presently booming due to.misuse of agriculture income.

out of my mind,"APMC act ...it exploited farmers...it push farmers to pickup the rassi and hang himself ( suicide)....

Scientific Spirituality,Mockery can bring you likes. It doesn't make your presentation logical.
chetan rattan,"Please speak on Shanta Kumar Report which says procurement of grains should be stopped from Punjab, Haryana, Western UP etc and should be done only in Eastern states, secondly as per DOHA round of WTO US, Canada, EU etc are pushing India to restrict  procurement and stocking  to service PDS i.e. 40%of population whereas food security act envisages stocks for 70% of population, thirdly what happened in Bihar after private procurement was introduced and public APMC were abolished and what happened to Apple growers in Himachal after corporate buyers monopolised procurement, lastly PEPSI has large contract farming for Potato in Punjab and issues and difficulties and corruption in procurement where in 10 years price has increased from 5 to 8 per Kg but input costs have increased manifold during this time. just giving political twist does not help farmers cause, the public at large cannot be swayed only on political and emotional appeal, the facts and issues and reasoning behind agitation has to be brought forward, if people know details on what is at stakes and what farmer stand to lose by these 3 laws..."

Arun Uday,"While I have great respect for the farmers, I have a few questions for them. Currently, farmers are a completely pampered lot, who pretty much get everything free of cost. Electricity - free. Water - free. Loans - at no interest and waivers in case of poor output. Income tax - waived. On top of all this, they want minimum price guarantee. So, my questions are as follows:
a. If agriculture as a profession is so unviable, why are they even doing that? Why not do something else?
b. While you farmers may be honest, hardworking etc. etc., so are many other types of workers (e.g. traders, small business owners, labourers etc.). Why should only you be getting differentiated treatment at the cost of everybody else?
c. What is wrong with a market determined price for your output? Isn't that the way things work for all other types of products/services?"
Mr Green Gold,"See if I am a Farmer shouldn't I have independence where to sell the produce?? The farming laws are giving Farmer's more freedom.

Its the middle men and who are protesting.

Why would Farmers protest against their own freedom??"
troublekick,"More than half of the states in country dont have APMCs/ or have already passed Bill to sell outside of APMCs anyways. 
If APMCs and MSPs are here to stay and the new Bill is providing additional option, Im failing to still understand what the problem is. ? What am i missing. Farmers can continue to seek in APMCs - whats the challenge. 
I know, its a a question from partial information most of the citizens have. Just trying to get the macro picture"

chance,Why sometimes onion became more than 100 per kilo and other vegetables at more than 50 per kilo. Simply the logic of APMC does not stand. MSP is here to stay and violent agitation on some hypothetical assumption is not acceptable. Thitrd why other states are not forthcoming with agitation. Fourth Punjab and Haryana are in the grip of organized syndicates of big farmers and since they are adversely affected they resort to such violent agitation.

Has Our Greed Overtaken Us? Sadhguru on Indian Farmers' Plight

still In india farmer 80% donot have a mobile with free wifi, no transport, no technology like Israeli, no advanced education especially on farming methods, now no MSP??.. who is fooling who ??.. thats why atleast now vote carefully change the centre govt to different party example aam admi party who donot have identity conflict whereas bjp with its discrimination policies now resulted dragging our own Indians on roads by forcing laws rather making it recommandation, who made unemployed many people like in kolkata by shutting down small bussiness like jute mills, and now almost every products are getting imported from china now even drowns? Even i can make a drown if manufacturing unit is provided with materials to make motors, cameras. Remember fools are always confident while wiser is hesitant and when fools become blind then it becomes disaster. We people the business person who is after some money, land and people who are still narrow minded biasing almost on everything a man created to show his superiority by caste, race, class, color, language, etc have no idea that he/she will also die one day and we cannot take away this wealth with us not even our bodies it will taken away by earth itself since we are like dust on this land and nothing in this universe.

Ren Sin,"At least, to strike a compromise, Govt. need to have a seperate agency to act as a business resource center for the farmers in each state that they can go to; to give them business guidance, teach them business & negotiating skills etc.  
Without that, it's like throwing them out of the ship and they're saying, they don't even know how to swim. Govt. They are the backbone of Indian society, Govt. needs to have understanding, empathy & compromise"
Ragd0ll,"86% of farmers were screwed before, I don't see the point of restoring the status quo. That's just ensuring that tens of thousands of farmers will die a slow death."

Danae Persephone,"Thank you for this valuable information. This is happening all around the world. It is about disapropriation of farmers and humanity at large. And privatisation through coporate business which have no understanding of life or respect of nature or humanity. In Germany government is making so many stipulations that farmers are close to insolvency as they cannot do all the investments the government is asking for. Once farming is stopped in Germany - of course food needs to be imported. This way they can make the world dependent by ""owning the food chain"" they can ""control"" humanity. Vandana Shiva has brought this scheme to light and she is a woman of wisdom and foresight as well as fortitude. Thank you and God bless you. May the true people of earth rise in love and truth and may we live in harmony with the sacred planet."

Shreekanya Baral,This needs more views. Couldn't ask for any better explanation weighing both pros and cons
sam vik,So you say that Farm bills are good for nation yet you promote farmer protest. hmm... I wonder why? Is it because Mode doesn't like farmers or will they deliberately choose not to implement it? If the fear is that the govt can meddle with regulations then can't they do it even today??

satyanarayana chopakatla,"How there will be implanting. Laws r good as per theory. But implementation failed many aspects/issues.
So my suggestion up to 5 years put tribunals with spl powers within 2 - 3 ?months. 
Once confidence taken place there will be no problems. Anything win - win situation. In most of the cases private companies are being advantages. In these cases farmers suffer.
It is delicate issue to be planned with  the some time to time examine to enable to get succeded."

Orest Makar,"Liberals would never support communism, or any other authoritarian regime. So not sure what you have put those two together. As a liberal I have to agree that the goal the government is pursuing is good the reforms will harm allot of people who rely on farming. The underlying idea is that small scale farming is unsustainable, as they will not be able to compete with big farms ""corporations"". The government want's to quickly reform the farming sector with disregard to what will happen to farmers. In my opinion the government should create a government farming fund that would issue out loans and grants to farmers for land acquisition and modernization and give out additional subsidies to those farmers that would want to sell their land and offer them financial incentive to change profession. The government should also prevent land monopolization by judge corporations that want to enter or increase their hold on the farming market. If the reforms are done right, farms will become larger and more modernized and thus will be able to produce more produce that could be sold at cheaper prices. The farmer will earn more, the food will be cheaper. The government should not leave behind those that decide (or in a worst case scenario will be forced by the market) to sell their land. These people can start businesses that provide services for farmers. Poland went threw similar reforms and has done fairly well with it's farming market. The government in Poland has oversight over the farming industry as provides financial incentive (lower taxes, grants and low interest loans) to farmers. 
Both extreme solutions will be damaging to people. The current system is unsustainable as small farmers produce very little and thus cannot compete on an open market without government subsidies. Even with the subsidies the farmers earn very little which doesn't allow them to invest in modernization. The liberalization of the farming industry will force many farmers out of business as big players will outperform and outcompete small farmers that will be forced to sell their land and figure out by themselves what they should do now.The latter solution wan't to quickly change the faming market no matter the human cost - Margaret Tatcher style. This will have quick beneficial results for the country but many farmers will be left to fend for themselves. Furthermore there is a risk that uncontrolled land acquisition fulled by corruption will create a handful of  huge corporations that control and dominate the market, destroying even large independent farmers. 
Reforms are necessary but they have to take into account Hunan lives that they will directly affect, and not only the big picture and macro data.
Good luck!"
Mahendra Sapa,"Just mention the name of Reliance and youth will lap onto believing in BS.

Two points I would like to make. 
1. Now small farmers have option to sell right at their own doorsteps and not worry about logistics, middlemen and commission/taxes / bribes.  All these leads to produce wastage and loss of important time/ cashflow etc.  Alternatively they're free to sell through MANDIS.

2. If Punjab State government does not like the bill, they may chose not to implement in their state."

Ranjit Neelakandan,"I watched patiently 5:00 min for him to explain the reasons and still he has not explained it.  Lets get this straight Punjabi/Haryanvi farmers are the biggest beneficiaries of MSP. Its a previlige and maybe due to policital reasons. How come we dont see other farmers from different up in arms ? Secondly, the ecommonic commodities act is anachronistic law from 1960s and 1970s. It does not allow anyone to stock on certain essential items. Removing this law will allow entites like wholesale dealers to stock up and help in price fluctuations like in onions and potatoes. There is nothing wrong with this from an economic efficiency point of view.  As Rumi said...this too shall pass."
Balaji Raman,This law will bring educated and skilled professionals into farming. And this will lead to innovation and productivity. If I can sell my produce directly to someone that's called freedom.
Ritika Ritu,"If this was a peaceful protest, the country wouldn't have been vandalized, police officers wouldn't have been murdered by the farmers tractors on the nation's capital, lady police officers wouldn't have been beaten and raped by these peaceful farmers!
If this protest was to defend farmers, then why is that only the wealthiest farmers are fighting against this? Its like Amazon saying socialism or communism is bad for the country. The highest farmer suicide rate is in Maharashtra and Bihar, not Punjab. Whole India supports this bill except for Punjab. We all know what Greta Thunberg tweeted along with the toolkit explaining exactly what Rihanna has to tweet and at what time. This is all an atmept to break and systematically dismantle the worlds largest democracy to create Khalistan. DO NOT LET FOREIGNERS DIVIDE INDIA AGAIN. LOTS OF FARMERS THROWS OR SELL AT VERY LOW PRICES  AS THEY DON'T GET BUYERS AS THERE IS LIMIT ON HOARDING 
PRIVATISATION WILL HELP EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCE AROUND THE COUNTRY AND EXPORT.
FARMERS WILL PRODUCE WHAT IS IN DEMAND NOT LIKE TRADITIONAL RICE OR WHEAT ONLY"
Green Nation,"Dear Sir:  Agreed that Punjab and Haryana farmers are doing well and they want the current STATUS QUO to continue.  But there are other farmers in the rest of INDIA who want to scale up and do something.  For example, KERALA FARMERS are all ready to scale up on JACK FRUIT POWDER and are making arrangements for cold storage system which will be made available through FPO (farmer producer organizations).   Like this there are many many examples.  If Punjab and Haryana are happy with STATUS QUO then so be it."

""Unity"" begins with truth. ""Healing"" is not possible without accountability. Stay loud. Accept nothing less. 
I also urge people not to hold all of India and all Hindus at fault for what is happening in Delhi, we can only be held accountable for our WORDS and ACTIONS and NEVER our beliefs. I love my Hindu brothers and sisters and there are many fighting with us against this oppressive regime, we are all brothers and sisters in Humanity.

Sukhdev Singh,"can I get transcript of this, So that I can share it with Bhakts"
Naveen Kumar,"I have spoken with many real farmers regarding farm laws.

Mostly they compare it with ola and uber model of business.

Their biggest fear is:  

The corporates will give very good rates initially, then all the farmers will sell only to corporates.

Then as a result of no business in APMC yards, APMC will collapse, as such even MSP will collapse.

Once the competition with government is eliminated.

Only then the corporates shall indulge in exploitation of farmers and the consumers.

By rigging the rates of commodities according to their wish, because of their storage capacity, and  in-between collaboration amongst many corporates.
 
Its a logical scenario according to me. 

Solution could be:

 The government can give assurance that it will never stop MSP and keep on running APMC by subsidy for next 25 years."

Hindhu Yuva Jagruthi," How farmhouse doralu n corrupted politicians on the name of farming income making white their corrupted income in crores by evading tax. That's what now crying not for farmer's welfare    

What is the CRUX of New Farm Reform and why the Opposition Politicians are worried.* starting with left long time Allie of BJP

Read this analysis to understand.

*In the new system, the traders of farm produce have to register them with their PAN with the Central Authority.*

*First level transaction (between farmer & Trader) is out of the purview of the GST system.*

*Gradually, further trade (through Registered Traders) will be brought into GST system.*
 Consequently, SALE and INCOME  of agriculture produce will get into Govt Records.  

*The GAME will start from here on.  The farmers will remain exempted from Income Tax & GST system forever.  But Traders in Agriculture produce selling up-stream will be brought into GST & IT regime.* 

To understand here is an example. *If Dora & Parivar parties corrupted politicians,+,+,+  are to sell their Grapes  Gobhi, etc worth Rs 500 Crs respectively to traders,  they will remain exempted from Income tax, but they have to quote the PAN of Trader in their ITRs.*

*The Trader has to pay the GST on Rs 500 Crs & Income Tax on its income by selling it up-stream*.  

*Imagine there are No Grapes & No Gobhi (it is the corrupt money)being laundered by the corrupted politicians* Naturally, Trader will take GST & Income Tax Payable from them.  *Therefore, ALL Commission Agents & politicians etc together will have to dish out huge sums of money NOT PAID till now showing their Agriculture Income.*

*Honest Farmers, who actually had physical produce, will remain free of this rut.* 

*This is the CRUX of the Matter. Now you understand why politicians are spending huge money in bringing (paid) agitators and trying to force the government to repeal .*

- Every PM in history has always acknowledged by being with the protestors atleast once. Modi called only Gujarat farmers after a suicide reported on 17th dec. Why Gujarat? Another clever move-a place where he knows he can buy supporters.
- Modi has free time for Ambani's grandchild
- Modi bends his head in front of Adani who has literally taken over Gujarat.

Amit P,"Farmers will have open market to sell produce anywhere. While local arthiyas(Traders) buy from them(Farmers) at a low price and sell them to other state traders at higher price to retailers and wholesellers. Now 3 laws will allow to sell directly , which will ultimately reduce cost and , companies(Aashirwad, pillsbury, Indiagate...) will sell at reduced price and we will have to pay less. 
Second scenario will be like investment, which will create inter-competition , like come I have a land to sow and grow , i will help so as gov subsidies (fertilizers , seeds& pesticides) now take some profit and I will keep the rest to become super rich like never before . Then India will lead 2050. 
so in a time to come  family-size  pizza will be like just 350 Rs only instead 570-600Rs . Look at ""China"" work and play on economy-of-scale.

Anonymous,"Adani,Ambani &other corporates had an eye on massive food grain market of India.They had few problems:

Problem 1 : 
States had different rules & regulations 2buy food grains frm farmers. It was difficult 4corporates 2handle so many states with so many different regulations & taxes

Modi Solution:
Took control from states and made 1 act for whole country. 

Corporates happy now.

Problem 2:
Corporates will buy crops and store them. But Essential Commodity act will stop them for storing crops for long time, as it increase prices in market.

Modi Solution: 
Food crops will not come under Essential Commodity act and can be stored for longer period. Corporates again happy.

Problem 3
It was hard to determine that what type of crop will be grown by farmers.

Modi Solution:

Contract farming for farmers where they will be told by corporates to grow what kind of crop. Corporates again happy.

Problem 4 :

How Corporates will handle court cases if anything goes wrong against farmers.

Modi Solution:

Farmers can not go to courts. They will go to SDM and DC.
Corporates again happy as they can bribe them

They say bills are in favor of farmers. ....

prakash yogi,It's mean it is clear that private players want to purchase farmers  crops less than MSP
prakash yogi,Nice vedio sir but if govt think that there are so many benefits of new farm law then why not govt becomes middle between farmers and private players and why not earn benefit and provide MSP to farmers .

Before(at the time of crop sown) we set  fix price of grains (1200)/quintal right 
After(harvesting) if farmers got much production .
And the rate of that crop is same as before (when we fixed it) in the market.
Then they will not get the benefits"
Aniket Singh,Thank you
Hashim Cheema,Government want to remove that middle man it is right and they just need to add msp in bill
Satyam Subramaniam,Government unable to stock more on same goods year on year and in rain you might have seen government stock is wasted. Farmers just grow same crop on msp guarantee and government have to buy and stock or pile them. Consumption is less and stock is more. Wasted. Hungry stays hungry and government cannot feed all free. Cannot sold outside country for loss. So they got new bill so wastage will be avoided. Directly sold in market will help government and farmers also think not to grow same crop so rates will be slashed if quantity is more. Government did good work but farmers have to think smart and grow new goods which are not available and if there is loss in this government should guarantee no loss...

It is not necessary that private company will not store the goods like apmc traders do."
Musadiq Hassan,Yes they should protest even everyone should protest
Devinder Singh Gurna,"Absolutely misguiding. The example given that out of auctioned price of rupees 100 farmers gets only 10 in APMC is grossly wrong. Middleman I.e.Commision Agent is paid only a commission and other service charges, thus essentially there is no middleman between trader and farmer in APMC. Traders being small and many there is no cartelization whereas as per new Bill's it will be a monopoly.  On  a burning issue every   Tom, Dick and Harry starts opinioatating even if he has no first hand knowledge of the subject. This man did exactly the same."

MSP daal degi lets say 25 rs per kg to wo jo private company hai wo extra 25 rs kyu degi wo to MSP key around hi buy karney ki koshish karegi."
Meenakshi Choudhary,Great sir well explained
Raghu P,"But govt assured that the APMC will always be there and MSP will always be provided there, APMC will never be shutdown, its farmers choice to go outside and explore more options or to go to APMC, just like BSNL is there along with other private telecom operators to regulate the telecom tariff, My father is a farmer from karnataka, he is very hardworking person, we grow paddy, here from 40 years what i am observing is only the middlemen and millers are benefitting from our crops, after working so hard and investing so much on labour's and pesticides, facing natural calamities, labour problems, water problems, machinery problems, new type diseases in the crops and all, what we are earn is just to accommodate our basic needs of food, cloths, bike thats it, forget our hardwork, sometimes we won't get back our investment also, present crop cutting done in this dec month is a complete loss for all paddy growers here, yield reduced very drastically due to new virus in our crops just like covid on humans, we not made any property from past 40 years, we don't get any thought of making some property with that earnings, just life goes on with hardworking forever, so something to be done to benefit the farmers, all these days only businessmans, middlemens are having decent earnings and making properties everywhere, small farmers fate remains same even after another 50years until unless if something is done now, our country is developing means everyone of us should develop, everyone be a part of it, only few sector people are developing is not a whole development of the country, these farm bills are not a big news here in South India or at least in our locality,  big protests and all happening there in North India, I doubt does farmers really able to understand these farm bills properly, mostly some opposition parties, middlemens and others who are benefitting now are having knowledge to understand these bills and its impacts and to safeguard their earnings in future they are provoking farmers with false predictions to protest against those bills, I trust our PM Modi like our family head, he never do anything harmful to the farmers or any other sector hardworking people, he doesn't have intentions to earn something by supporting corporates bcz he not even have children's to earn for them, treats all of us as his children's,  these farm bills are actually beneficial to the farmers and consumers except those middlemens, initially there may be some loopholes, bcz everything can't set right on one go, it will take some time to block all loopholes,  later definitely will have good future in the farm sector also"

Supriya Bedi,"I really like your videos, but if I may say this, I would have liked more from this video...the political angle- the way the bills were bulldozed and how there were no prior consultations with the farmers. Perhaps adding why the fear of the farmers about the big corporations and contract farming are not unfounded should have been included. Maybe because these are short videos and these are complex topics you could not get into the details but I would have liked more points, maybe about how the various states which did away with the act have fared, etc. this video really did help me in understanding what the laws theoretically aim at or are, but i think it did gross injustice to the practical aspects and also it generalized things a little too much.

Rajiv Dixit- The India with secrets,"BILL 1. The corporates don't have to give taxes as the APMC markets, which will make them able to offer higher MSP at first, now due to the disadvantage faced by APMC agents, in long term, those mandis will become redundant/disappear. About FCI, it doesn't always take the food from the farmers, it will only take to a certain limit due to space limitations, thus if the farmers don't get a fair price at the industry, they won't be able to sell it to FCI at MSP. It is to be noted that always, FCI has a surplus of food.
Moreover, the farmers are demanding the same APMC system of pricing with the corporates too, that is MSP+. If this is done and a small about of tax [  similar to apmc tax ] is levied on them it would be better.
BILL 2: ( Contract Farming)--> The companies who have contract has very strict specifications and has legal clauses which allow them to repeal the produced food if there are minor changes in them since farming is a natural process there are always deviations, in that case the farmer will be in back foot.
BILL 3: Hoarding will result in controlling of prices, suppose there's a bumper crop production, due to the high level supply the price of the crop will reduce so the corporates who have huge facilities of storing these foods will hoard it, now when the supply is less and prices go up these companies won't buy due to obvious reasons, as it is costly for them thus the farmer will be facing difficulty in both situations. If there's a rule for msp for all the players in the market then I think it will reduce the uncertainty."

RINKU GHOSH,main thing is that farmers are not ready to hear at all.....so gov also should not introduce any reform for these fools....there is clearly written in bill no land of farmers will be taken....and if farmers do not agree with corporates to sell there produce then do not sell and anyway i think in open market without trade farmer can sell at a better price....and its not that farmers are not getting MSP ...they are getting more msp as compared to 2014.....so i think we must support farm bills...

Shankar SM,"One or two states were given priority during the times of food shortage in India and these were Punjab and Haryana. The system of commissions this agents and tax collected by the state I'd not correct since this need not be supported by the Central Government and if so then all states have to be given similar status. The fear that private traders would take advantage is too be volunteered by the farmers through collective bargaining and they can have these commission agents in their behalf. Also if farmers are happy with commission agents, these people can themselves become the sole traders.  All said and done while government is coming out of public sector participation slowly evenin defence, telephones, power, aviation etc., It is not reasonable to ask Central Government to be the left purchaser of food grains. Ofcourse Central and State governments would come to help farmers whenever there is a need since farming is the backbone of the country. While every other states' farmers go directly to markets and were happy when levy on rice mills were lifted his can these farmers have a different treatment even after decades? Politicised farmers are taking to bandhs in these difficult times giving based name to all farmers in general."

DRIVELAZA,Farmers are innocent hard workers.... Hope government tries to educate them about the empowerment and benefits of the bill passed. Its only because of state government politics and misguidance which has lead to chaos. Not at all farmer's fault. Nor the central government's fault. If farmers are worried then government has to convince them and make sure corporate companies treat farmers equally as a business partner and do not exploit them. Once mandi system is removed only then farmers will be able to think out of the box. Hope we see farmers evolve and be the richest and happiest citizens.

But bringing outside GIANT players will eat up both small and big farmers MORE SO because the Govt and Govt bodies will DANCE TO THE TUNES of the GIANT PVT PLAYERS. & the farmer community will disappear or stop existing.
The Govt broke the back bone of the common man by introducing DEMONETISATION  jeopardising jobs and small businesses ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

NOW the Govt is trying to break the Farmers and ultimately THIS GOVT will force the entire nation to SLAVERY. ..to be at the MERCY of MODI...DEMOCRACY will go to the DUST BIN.

Pramod,"I heard a very interesting analogy today,
A 10 floor building did not have a lift, so people had problem climbing up and down. Specially the elderly and the kids, so the society started exploring options.
Finally they got some donkeys, who could carry people up and down. The donkey owners would charge people for carrying them up and down for a fee and would also pay 10% to the society from the revenue they earned. It was a very happy situation for all involved.
After sometime the society management changed, the new management decided to install a lift for carrying people up and down.
All hell broke loose and everyone started protesting, this is not fair, society will loose revenue, the donkey owners will be jobless and no food for them (human rights issue), the donkeys will be worthless (animals rights issue), all were angry.
Society management clarified, the lift is available to all but the gentlemen who wanted to use the donkeys could still do it. But no, the agitation continued and so finally the new management had to succumb to the pressure.
The final arrangement was arrived and so anyone who wanted to climb the building could still use the donkey. The donkey would carry a person, go in the lift and carry people up & down. All were happy.
Disclaimer: any resemblance of this with the farmers agitation is a coincidence."

Kumar Gurutharan,"Which Is this truth are the farmers being cheated all these years by middlemen ?

Another side of the story !!!

Farmers are being cheated wake up Indian farmers so sad 
the opposition is using this to creat havoc during Carona virus  time 
The powerful middlemen who were profiting with help of congress and other opposition are paying the union leaders to continue to agitate while many poor farmers  are ready to move to allocated grounds and to talk to the government 
Its strange only in Punjab this is happening? 

During this time farmers stood on their feet and earned some money .. and lived with respect. The bill is about to get rid of middlemen traders with political powers .. This is why the opposition is angry because they can no longer make money. We can no longer allow our farmers to commit suicide.and stop bla in ck money 

The Agriculture Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha and the states. Now see the game of this bill

Agriculture is part 2 of Bill Demonicism.

Just as the demonetisation of black money was dismantled, similarly the two giants of Punjab and Maharashtra were destroyed by this bill.
Akali Dal from Punjab and Sharad Pawar from Maharashtra got engaged.
It had an annual income of at least Rs 5,000 crore. He was a commission agent between FCI and farmers.

His company received a 2.5% commission. All the warehouses belong to him. No farmer could sell a tonne of wheat to FCI without the tag of Zubair Agro.

All are wasted in one stroke.

Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule in Maharashtra showed agricultural income of Rs 10,000 crore.

The family had control over the entire onion, chilli and grape trade.

Bill left Pawar nowhere.

Modi cut the root, not its black money-stopping branches ... The monopoly enriched the farmers for a change, but the opposition should not listen to those who are trying to cheat the farmers

The Akali Dal and NCP can be seen begging in the next election."

faltu phone,"The bill was intended for a greater good and for letting farmers get their fair bit of share by open sales and not restricted to mandis. A kind of win - win situation. However the fear is, the gaint companies who will offer to buy their goods are going to impose laws and regulations which will go against the common good of farmers and eventually they will start losing their inheritance on their assets. Moreover the law will allow third party mass buyers to decide the rate and in due competence farmers will be compelled to sell at lower price than their profitable prices. Even i thought bill was good..later on hearing multiple agendas and possibilities i reside against it."

Farmers should be little patient instead of assuming as if MODI is some representative of Ambani/Adani. Modi is 70 year old and he doesn't need money from Ambani and Adani. Stop blaming Modi. Modi is transforming India so that farmer's generations in future can continue to be proud farmers of India with richness and wealth. Modi is bringing India at par with Western economies. Farmers are misinformed. Modi is cleaning up mess of Congress and Corruption. Modi doesn't work for any Ambani and Adani.

I guess not, because the farm bill is only a  choice provided to the farmer to either sell to the APMC or any private player.  (Preamble of the bill) . Here the farmer is made KING n not the blood sucking middlemen.
 By construing this bill only will sink a farmer is just fear mongering . The act doesn't at any point highlight the doing away of APMCs. This Act is the best way forward for the actual heroes, the farmers to get their rightful dues henceforth which has been stopped by the parasites called Middlemen over decades. Kindly read n understand the bill in TOTO before crying foul.

NovemberNix,If the private companies take up then it will as expensive as electric city in india.. Simple as government bodies will always work for the welfare for the citizens but the private companies will only work for the profit. Our country people really needs to use their common sense rather only entertainment.
TIN ARAVIND,As long as Central govt does not collude with Private companies i think these reforms are good for Farmers freedom.

commodityHelp,"They are middlemen. Long Live Comrade Modi . What the Left, Congress  did not do ...BJP has done that. The Peasantry is now free and industrial capital is introduced in Agricultural breaking the middlemen nexus with politician. Being a Marxist, I support BJP and PM Modi."
MacroFinance Suff,"MSP is a ""racket"" to enrich farmers esp. large ones in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh because >60% of MSP goes to support grains like rice and wheat, the main products of the those 3 states. That's why they are the only ones protesting. Most of the poor farmers of Bihar and other regions of India, who really need help, don't even know what MSP is because they have not been able to take advantage of it (there are structural reasons for it). And that's why you don't see them protesting against the bills. Reform in Indian ag sector is needed because the policy has failed to elevate ag sector in a long time. Having said that I am surprised that Modi-Shah failed to read politics of subsidy esp. in agriculture. May be they have become too over-confident having successfully rammed through Article 370 and CAA legislations."
Karan Sandhu,"Problem faced by farmers- 
1. Msp
2. If any dispute between farmers and corporate people. Court doors are shut for farmers they cant go to any court . They can only go to sdm or maximum to dc . Now you tell me  is a sdm or dc in range of a small farmers in india?
3. Corporate companies can stock their materials to any limit legal which is major cause food crisis and price rise. This is law under which corporate are going to control Indian markets according to them selves legally.
3 . Modi is saying it's going to be 1 nation 1 market. It already 1 market we can sell our crops anywhere in india legally before this. 
4. Ambanis modi says he gone remove middle man from farmers purchase but what actually he is doing is he is involveing middle man in this by law . Artias are not middle man they are service providers. So make it clear farmers want service providers not middle man . 
5. Many many more if you read 3 bills clearly.
6. Stop watching godi media if you want to save this country.  And give me answers all bhagts of modi - which promises he had completed in his pm term please answer me ."

... privatisation is good for development but bad for poor people..."
Pranay Bhati,The simple reason for the poor display of our farming sector is because the apmc is a sham in our country. The corruption of apmc and cartel system has degraded it to an extent that it has become redundant. I concide that MSP is required for the corporate option of selling crops but we have to understand that capitalism does work to an extent and competition in mandis can bring in the change that is much needed.

8:22 while here, he said MSP will not be provided outside of the mandi and so farmers will not be be able to benefit with the MSP,

Pankaj Rai,Have you noticed any flaws in the reform laws in interest of farmers. There are many new opportunities in laws for farmers without diminishing the previous facilities. The compulsion of brokers are eliminating from agricultural products marketing. Which will free genuine farmers from the cut money of brokers. Many other provisions are in favour of farmers. If we genuinely wants to help farmers we should support agricultural reform bills in interest of farmers not brokers and other interest groups.
Manish Agrawal,"Doesn't explain a thing. No why's. Just bad journalism standards. Explain the issue, side by side and tell why is an unlicenced trader is an issue?

What the bill is, what is the fear is, and then the best case and worst case scenarios.  Thanks"
Hindhu Yuva Jagruthi," How farmhouse doralu n corrupted politicians on the name of farming income making white their corrupted income in crores by evading tax. That's what now crying not for farmer's welfare    

What is the CRUX of New Farm Reform and why the Opposition Politicians are worried.* starting with left long time Allie of BJP

Read this analysis to understand.

*In the new system, the traders of farm produce have to register them with their PAN with the Central Authority.*

*First level transaction (between farmer & Trader) is out of the purview of the GST system.*

*Gradually, further trade (through Registered Traders) will be brought into GST system.*
 Consequently, SALE and INCOME  of agriculture produce will get into Govt Records.  

*The GAME will start from here on.  The farmers will remain exempted from Income Tax & GST system forever.  But Traders in Agriculture produce selling up-stream will be brought into GST & IT regime.* 

To understand here is an example. *If Dora & Parivar parties corrupted politicians,+,+,+  are to sell their Grapes  Gobhi, etc worth Rs 500 Crs respectively to traders,  they will remain exempted from Income tax, but they have to quote the PAN of Trader in their ITRs.*

*The Trader has to pay the GST on Rs 500 Crs & Income Tax on its income by selling it up-stream*.  

*Imagine there are No Grapes & No Gobhi (it is the corrupt money)being laundered by the corrupted politicians* Naturally, Trader will take GST & Income Tax Payable from them.  *Therefore, ALL Commission Agents & politicians etc together will have to dish out huge sums of money NOT PAID till now showing their Agriculture Income.*

*Honest Farmers, who actually had physical produce, will remain free of this rut.* 

*This is the CRUX of the Matter. Now you understand why politicians are spending huge money in bringing (paid) agitators and trying to force the government to repeal .*

Even if it is a farmer who returned to Bandara due to government policy and bought poison at home. If the government gives relief to 6000 farmers on the eve of elections, then all is well .. then we can give relief again before the next election ...

The BJP in India has a problem that can only be solved by spreading hypocritical nationalism and racism in Pakistan and China. The Indian public consciousness has changed so much.

As long as the BJP can easily convert the votes of dalits, bridesmaids, Chandalans and Eezhavas into ""Hindu"" votes in India ruled by ministers who proudly claim to be a non - onion eating caste, 'anti-jihadi' love laws will continue to prevail in India.

By new bill, large companies will buy directly from farmers and sell it directly to end user. For govt its easier to regulate 1 company then regulating 1000 scumbags middle men.

Unlinked Carbon,"These bills are a huge favour for the corporate.
1) Companies can lure the farmers for contract farming resulting in excessive use of pesticides and promoting mono-cropping which is bad for the ecosystem (as well as fertility of soil)
2) MSP isnt guaranteed (not mentioned in the ordinances)
3) Farmers can be easily exploited by the companies because there is no mechanism of fixation of prices in price assurance bill.
4) An expert in agricultural laws says there might be shortage of food items in public market.
5) Contract farming system(though is could lead to exploitation of farmers by big companies) is relevant for farmers who own large land but what about the farmers who own small lands.
6) As onions, pulses been removed from essential commodities there are chances of black marketing.
7) Apmc acted as a mediator though it collected tax it ensured MSP and now with companies dealing with farmers directly think about any legal battles that could arise and farmers has to fight in the court just like the recent Pepsis Indian farmer lawsuit.

1)  one effective strategy can be involve parents of LGBTQ couples in public initiatives: this helps fight against attempts to dehumanise LGBTQ couple or people.
2) By the help of media , Tv and films because media is one of the effective tool to reach mass audience it will make people who are protesting or also not protesting understand what LGTBQ mean and about their constitutional rights. This content will make change their hearts and mind.
3) By sharing their stories in front of people can also be the great initiative because conversation help in influencing people and this will give exposure to these people that how ""normal"" they are."

- Every PM in history has always acknowledged by being with the protestors atleast once. Modi called only Gujarat farmers after a suicide reported on 17th dec. Why Gujarat? Another clever move-a place where he knows he can buy supporters.

Mohammed Shareef C,This idiot is working for some anti-democratic and anti people corporates
Confused Soul,"The way this bill was passed in Rajya Sabha has left me in shock.This is something that everyone should be really worried about.Everything else can be debated but the way this bill was passed is something no one in their right mind would agree with.

The opposition wasnt even allowed to speak.

The Rajya Sabha TV was cut off when the members of the opposition were actually speaking.

The opposition wanted to send the resolutions to the committee and they werent able to.

The opposition wanted a vote on Farmers bill, that did not happen either.

Gone are the days when the democracy was destroyed by a complete dictatorship. Now the dictators create an illusion of democracy. This is what is happening now. The opposition is in jail in Kashmir, the journalists are in jail, the dissent is being silenced with the help of draconian laws like UAPA.

This is what happens when you put uncivilized people in charge of the nation. They have never learnt to follow the rules. Modi cares about BJP first, then about the country. He needs those funds through those electoral bonds to fight the elections.This bill is what the corporates get in exchange for those juicy bonds."
Amar K.,Sir what was the hurry may I ask  Shame on the Deputy Chairman of Rajyasabha conduct and approach u murdered the parliamentary form of democracy ....
Trump Chicha - US wale,"Before you make a myopic conclusion, lemme clear some of your basics. There are two ways in a house by which a motion or a bill can be passed, Voice vote, and Division. By rule, any motion or bill is first passed by a voice vote, just as they did here, if ayes are louder, theyre said to have it, if the noes are louder, theyre said to have it, seems undemocratic right? Heres where Division comes into play. Even if a Single member of the house is unsatisfied or opposed to the decision made by the voice vote, by rule, the votes are taken again by a digital vote recorder machine. If youd have seen the proceedings of RS on 20th September, youd have noticed that no member of the opposition was  opposed/unsatisfied with the voice vote, which by default made it the final decision. Even if a single member wouldve been against the voice vote, the division process would have been initiated. So, u just cant blame BJP for it conducted the voice vote. Thats how parliament has been working since years."

RINKU GHOSH,main thing is that farmers are not ready to hear at all.....so gov also should not introduce any reform for these fools....there is clearly written in bill no land of farmers will be taken....and if farmers do not agree with corporates to sell there produce then do not sell and anyway i think in open market without trader farmer can sell at a better price....and its not that farmers are not getting MSP ...they are getting more msp as compared to 2014.....so i think we must support farm bills...

Guy Darj,"Excellent videos... But I wish you would have covered the excess farming of wheat etc due to MSP and the resultant enormous loss to the government (which indirectly translates to us the taxpayers ie the citizens).  Hoped you'd cover that less than 6% of the farmers get to sell at MSP... Also approx 90% of rice and wheat from Punjab and Haryana is procured by the government... Whereas govt warehouses are full and have no place to store the grain (hence stored outside covered in tarp - google the wastage of food grain in government godowns) also wheat & rice have almost no demand in other countries...(some countries have banned rice from India due to the lack of nutrients)... . Also no other states are protesting eg UP, Maharashtra, MP & Bihar..  The fact is that the middlemen stands to lose out... Large bulk producers of wheat and rice will lose out... Also Govt can't distribute these excess food grains for free or sell at subsidised rates since it has a MSP... The grains would recycle back and the market price would fall causing more loss to the government because of MSP... And the fact remains that no government would want to make the poor farmers even more poorer... Its a sensitive issue..a complex issue...  Have faith... One can't kill the farmers and hope to survive..."

cute talk,aap bhout ache se explain krte h ........thank you
girish gupte,You are forgetting one basic fact.APMC Law does not permit farmers to sell their produce outside mandies. Which means mandis are having captive market.This is being misused.
girish gupte,Exactly this problem was referred to Supreme court but EX CJI avoided to take position.

For Aliana Chawla,"And the main problem is not the act or law; the problem is that the judiciary of India is so poor that you would have Indian law saying for instance ""making obscene videos is a crime or encouraging a movie porn maker is a crime in itself."" But, these people are celebrated on news channel every moment & are not penalised as per the law. 

So, bringing a law giving farmer right prices enabling them to enjoy their due share saying that farmers right will be protected after the legal agreement with the other party. 

I don't believe that it is possible, the reason is that the celeberated corrupt enjoys great power & half of the masses don't know that they are corrupt and address them as 'Saabs' & fear them as they are influential. 

Because criminals in suits or proper kurta pyjama in farming & other sectors enjoys good influence in the society and are a reason of crime done on many. 

It is first hard for a non-influential farmer to file his complaint. Even if he does, it is not easy to get justice along with that he has to face violence & threat if he is challenging a person who is extremely powerful because of his influence on other people. 

So, bringing law or amendments do not serve the purpose in any sector including farming till the respected influential criminal on tv & in the society are not referred as what they are in the society. 

So, that a criminal leader do not create people from the youth his fans on the basis of fake persona & slowly manipulates them to be extremely violent on the masses. Thus, it is better to say them what they are rather than calling them as 'Saabs' & giving the respected criminals acceptance."

Sahil Shenai,One of the best explanations I have seen of farm laws. Explaining with Lego kit was best. 
Madan Mohan Dash,Sir pls read the bill thoroughly....it's very gd for farmers.......
Don't Blink,"1) Contract farmers can make contracts with farmers without farmers having any legal protection to appeal. Farmers will have to abide by fine prints in legal contracts, which even educated people like us cant fight with big corporates.

2) Farmers can sell their goods anywhere. Big farmers can benefit from it, but small farmers any way dont go to mandi's. But it's governments way to get out of farming business and selling to private companies means facing the ups and downs of the market. Government will not intervene by giving any subsidy or help for procurement.

Arjun Garva,"1. 4:50 aap bol rahe hai APMC hata do but bills me to aaisa nahi hai. Usme to aaisa hai ki aapko choice di jayegi na ki APMC hataya  jayega.
2. 6:15 aaisa bhi kahi nahi likha gaya ki tum jao corporates ke paas. Farmers apna produce kahi bhi bech sakta hai. Interstate Intrastate kahi bhi bech sakte ho.
3. Corporate farmers ko kitne paise dega wo MSP se decide hoga. EK model contract hoga. Sir aap apne hisab se saare assumptions bana rahe hai. Aap ki har baat se aaisa lag raha hai ki is bills se sirf ambani ko fayda hoga.
4. 8:56 ""hum tume paise nahi denge to tum kya ukhad loge"". Bhai sahab model contract hoga usme sab kuch likha hoga aur payment 1 din me ho jaani chahiye aaisa bhi likha hai bills me. Aur agar yaha pe bhi kuch nahi hota to dispute settlement bhi hai. Haan ye sahi hai ki dispute settlement bureaucrats ki jagah  court ya tribunal me hona chahiye. 
5. Though the ordinance was unethical and should have been discussed with farmers but it was not unconstitutional.
6. 10:55 ""isko pura hum corporates ke haath me de rahe hai"" ye baat to bilkul galat hai. Online trading ka bhi option hai. Aur bills me to aaisa likha gaya hai aap apni APMC ke bahar apna produce bech sakte hai.
7. 11:20 ""APMC ko nikal ke phek diya"" aaisa bhi kahi nahi likha. Maharashtra ka example dekhlo waha bhi vilasrao deshmukh ki government ne aaisa he law paas kiya tha aur waha to sab accha chal raha hai aur waha tab kisine kuch nahi bola. 

I know there are certain problems with these bills like regulations and dispute settlement etc. but It should be amended in the bills instead of revoking the bills."

So don't you think we should allow private sector in farming in India? So that India becomes a developed country. I think this will allow people to move from middle income trap and improve their living standard(HDI).

Kerala don't have any APMC. But Kerala gives highest MSP. This is achieved by government directly procuring from farmers and avoiding Arhtiyas. So the cost of middle man directly gets transferred to farmers.

3) Price discovery can be find in e-nam, which is governed by APMC.
4) Farmer has every right to negotiate with the vendor as per new bill, if they are pre-approved crop. Then price will be decided even before seed is sowed in the land.

Plz don't miss guide....."
T. SANTOSH KUMAR,"Hi Aakash, your explanation is good but this bill is not scrapping the selling in Mandi and if farmers not happy with corporate price they can deal with Mandi. Am I correct?"
devranjan68,"For complete and unbiased understanding of this farmer's issue, watch the video in the link below..its bit long because to explain things properly one has to go in details..its by one of the most reputed teacher for civil services examination.. its for understanding purposes.. not by any news media..so no propaganda here

Cyber007,"It is NOT about farmers..it is about survival of local logistics jobs - collection & cleaning grains.. transportation, storage, distribution...  flour making, roti making factories... alcohol industry in Punjab.
The locals want to prevent PRIVATIZATION of agriculture businesses for their local job survival."
Ningyo H,"No money for farmers  but 951 crore for new parliment for hardly work politicians ?? Wow we finally have our priority right, im so proud of this historic moment"
Shruti Chandola,Well explained sir
Aditya Jha,"You missed some points, actually nowadays there is no more auctioning in APMC, the MSP is actually the maximum selling price for the farmers and farmers doesn't matter how much they produce they doesn't get enough of their value. Secondly, these APMC union's tax money goes to state government instead of central government.

Moreover, it is on free will of farmers if they want to sell their product in Mandis or directly to corporates. The price rice due to middlemen can fall due to this and farmers will get the benefits.
Sure, bill has lots of negatives but you should've pointed out few positives as well."
Jasmine Sethi,"You should also do a talk to explain the farmers bill impact on normal common citizens. Specially now that there is more clarity, how MSP will only be triggered for perishables and non perishables after threshold of 150-200% That is almost an automatic assurance for common man pricing of all essential food products will go up by minimum 30-50% . Second also research and mention what happened in USA or other countries with corporate agriculture- how vegetables and fruits there only look good but lack nutritional value. Why GMO seeds were forced on farmers, how organic farming will go out forever. How more pesticides will seek in for higher yield and more production to meet schedule of delivery. Yes corporates help with more modern equipment and large scale yield but at what cost ? I think we do need them but with regulation. Otherwise the farmers are better off now and do us the common man. Indus is a poor country without welfare policy for good and price inflation too high people will starve and die. What is more important Walmart and reliance to profit or us as a nation to survive and live peacefully. Hunger will give rise to more tensions and strife."

Air India ,BSNl,LIC,Indian Railways and now Agriculture. There is also talks to bring private playes in banking.
Why Govt schools, organizations can't operate like private organisations. 
How would you evaluate a Govt's success? By counting the number of privatization?"
adarsh kumar,"But APMCs will continue to exist.. The only change is that farmers are given other options.
Nobody is abolishing APMCs or MSP! Farmers can now choose where they want to sell their produce. If anything, these laws have liberated the farmers from oppressive monopoly of the middlemen!"

I know I'm not that old to talk politics nd all but bhaiya I don't know why I become so depressed whenever I start thinking about our country's  condition. They are literally torturing farmers, censoring social media, asking companies for our personal data, controlling news media and god knows what else. I love my country so much, but yesterday when I was at my uncle's house, we were talking about all these, and when I put forward my points about so called hindutwa, farmers, muslims etc., everyone started asking  ""are u even a hindu or not, why bhagwa hindustaan is causing u this much of problem, modi ji is censoring social media to stop terrorism and he is the one who made ram mandir possible (Supreme Court is Joke for them.
and eventually after about half an hour, they started saying u are not a kshatriya, u were supposed to be a muslim etc. I ran away then.
I don't know what's wrong or what's right, but one thing I'm sure of is Modi ji is the new Hitler, and this government can do whatever it likes without even letting people realize it."

Every party who has come into power has used this method especially under indira gandhi .... Now before you bash me I am not justifying this but it is said that if every bill or any move is to be introduced like the right way then only half the changes would have been there in our country meaning india would have seen half of the bills or development today.. Abolition kashmir special status( which i obviously support) is also done by this ..if done right it would have been still a political issue for another decade thereby creating more division within society, more hate , more intolerance"

5. Online GPS network for all government and private warehouses with transparent capacities, costs and facilities like nitrogen chambers and dehumidifiers. Here also every farmer can put a price tag including warehousing fees for off-seasonal revenues.

6. Crop insurance settlement ratio is at par with world standards.

WIP work in progress,"- Because of international protests now Modi feels scared. So he decided to take charge in d state where he had monopoly. Perfect politics. Now he will try to show to other countries that he has made the right decision by taking few states on his side. 
- BEWARE he is going to silently start by giving money to poor people of MP.
- If Modi wants to divide wealth of rich.
First spread Ambani's property in poor people.
Modi ko aag isliye lagi ki bus punjab mein congress kyun ayi !! STOP TAKING FARMERS LAND....
- as Rajewal uncle mentioned, this AANDOLAN is at its peak now. Be disciplined. And be focused only on your demands of farming.
- Every PM in history has always acknowledged by being with the protestors atleast once. Modi called only Gujarat farmers after a suicide reported on 17th dec. Why Gujarat? Another clever move-a place where he knows he can buy supporters.
- Modi has free time for Ambani's grandchild
- Modi bends his head in front of Adani who has literally taken over Gujarat.
- we know govt. will not remove EVM. So give us d option. Let d people of india decide how they want to vote? By ballot or EVM."

The Contract Farming should also be done between APMC and Corporates based on the contract they also can ordered the Farmers to crop as per....

APMC should organized the farmers and on behalf of the Farmers APMC should deal with the corporates.

Here the new bill can increase the hold of private sector on farming which may leads the higher price of Agriculture Product in retail market and lower profit to Farmers.
It can also increase hoarding to increase price.

Punjabi Class,"Delhi Parliament itself needs reforming and modernisation. Passing of the 3 farmers bills is testimony of failures in following the rule books of Parliament. A handful of people decided the fate of millions without debates and consultations. A bill that is passed under controversial circumstances should not become law.

On 20 September 2020, in Parliament the rule book was ignored by the chairman.

1. The rule book says that if a voice vote is challenged by any member, the chairman must ask for a division. Under no circumstances must a chairman ignore this demand. The chairman ignored this demand. 

2. Audio and broadcasting was censored in parliament when division was demanded by opposition so the public could not see it.

3. BJP did not have enough numbers to pass the bill so it rushed it in an undemocratic way.

4. Voice vote is only chosen where 70 percent of members support a bill. This bill did not meet that criteria so voice vote does not apply. However, the chairman decided to go ahead with voice vote and for his ears, it was a yes. Voice vote is not recorded so it's open to controversy.

5. When members stood from their seats, the rule book says that Parliament should have been adjourned. The chairman did not adjourn the parliament. He rushed the bill through instead.

6. Opposition requested the bills to be put forward to a select committee. The chairman denied them that opportunity, again against the rule book.

7. Not enough time was given for the bill to run in Gujrat as a trial. Gujratis have not openly praised the bills.

8. BJP refused to have a debate on the bills. They rushed them through.

9. There are 4 ways of voting: voice vote, counting vote, voting recorder or votes by lobbying. The weakest voting method is voice vote. There is no permanent record in voting this way. This bill was rushed through voice votes. This should not have happened. It is the weakness of the chairman and this bill was too important to be treated this way.

10. Eight MP's were suspended from Parliament that day. This left the house empty. 15 bills were passed through parliament in the absence of these suspended MP's because the opposition was eliminated.

This is not democracy. It is no where near democracy. The PM has a lot to answer for."
Punjabi Class,"A few comments have been seen stating that the Indian flag was disrespected on 26 January 2021 at the red fort. It is false that a Khalistani flag was displayed at the red fort on that day. 

The Indian flag remained untouched on 26 January 2021 at the red fort.
An empty pole was used by an individual to display the Nishan Sahib. It is questionable as to how these individuals managed to enter the Red Fort, which is traditionally sealed off three days before 26 January parade. 

Nishan Sahib was first used as a symbol by Guru Hargobind Sahib ji in the 17th century. It is a flag that signifies a Sikh Gurdwara and is displayed in around 40,000 Gurdwaras across India.

A Nishan Sahib is a sacred flag for the Sikh community, under which Sikhs do selfless service unconditionally without expecting any rewards in return. 

To recognise a Nishan Sahib: it is Orange in colour with a khanda in the middle. There is no other writing on it."

Confused Soul,"The way this bill was passed in Rajya Sabha has left me in shock.This is something that everyone should be really worried about.Everything else can be debated but the way this bill was passed is something no one in their right mind would agree with.

The opposition wasnt even allowed to speak.

The Rajya Sabha TV was cut off when the members of the opposition were actually speaking.

The opposition wanted to send the resolutions to the committee and they werent able to.

The opposition wanted a vote on Farmers bill, that did not happen either.

Gone are the days when the democracy was destroyed by a complete dictatorship. Now the dictators create an illusion of democracy. This is what is happening now. The opposition is in jail in Kashmir, the journalists are in jail, the dissent is being silenced with the help of draconian laws like UAPA.

This is what happens when you put uncivilized people in charge of the nation. They have never learnt to follow the rules. Modi cares about BJP first, then about the country. He needs those funds through those electoral bonds to fight the elections.This bill is what the corporates get in exchange for those juicy bonds."

No offense to anyone but farmers of punjab and haryana are far from what could classified as poor farmers and yet the poor farmers of maharastra, UP, Bihar are not protesting but relatively properous landowners of Punjab and haryana are.  State govr and APMCs of some states band together to suck FCI dry  and hoard most of denefit of FCI and MSP, even though its for whole of nation but who cares, its not like most farmers sympathizers actually care or know about farmers anyway.   P.S  M not a supporter of BJP/RSS  but doesnt mean whatever they do is always 100% negative. in simple m not bias :-)"

Gaurav Vashist,"i think farm laws are a way to empower farmers, the laws may not be perfect as of now but at least their is an initiative.

Nivedita Mishra,"So hey, I was having a chat with dad wrt opposition claim on MSP. Has the price of MSP been specified in the 3 acts, with a rider of course that it will be reviewed every year by a select committee or some such body, not ONLY by bureaucrats? Apparently, just to say that MSP remains is not enough. To say that it is being restored to its original intent of being minimum support price and not, what it has become, maximum sale price will not do. Do throw some light on that.

Also, farmers in Odisha are agitating for a while against BJD govt that the token system to sell produce to the mandi is flawed and how many farmers haven't been able to sell. Sonepur and Bargarh are the rice bowls in western Odisha and they are unhappy. Others too,but they are more visible. That is also where Bjp wins in Odisha.

So, could we have a series on farm issues, on whether problems vary state to state? Cheerio"

Priya,Very clear video sir!!! People need to see this.
S.P. Asokan,"I dont understand what Shekhar says. Only in a free market, there are possibilities for many intermediaries between the producers and the consumers. In the regulated market, there is only one government agency between them. When there is excess supply, prices fall in a free market, and the MSP is only discretion that the Government may or may not exercise. But in the regulated market, there can be political and public pressure on the Government to give MSP for the farm products. In India, our farm production has far exceeded our need. That is the reason why farmers prefer a regulated market where MSP is assured. From the farmers point of view, their opposition to the free market is in their interest."
Suyog Ghosh Dasttidar,I was expecting my blood to boil but was pleasantly surprised from your unbiased opinions. Showing concerns over a new law is healthy but these 'poor farmers' in their Range rovers are just embarrassing the country.

Sarat Chandra,"I am doing a PhD in Economics and I can say with utmost confidence that NONE OF YOUR ARGUMENTS MAKE SENSE. 

With all due respect, most of your video argues that we need reforms in farming. EVERYONE agrees that we needs reforms, especially the FARMERS who are committing suicides due to lack of good reforms. But what reforms do we need?!

YOU HAVE SAID NOTHING ABOUT HOW THE FREE MARKET REFORMS WILL HELP FARMERS! WHY ON EARTH WILL THE FREE MARKET CARE ABOUT FARMERS SUICIDES?! The reforms have to be in THE LEFT direction (MORE PROTECTION!). The current reforms are in THE RIGHT direction (which ironically is WRONG!). You just showed some antique documents and old laws and quoted specific professors. But not a single argument about why free market is better for farmers!! 

After everything that happened in India during COVID, corporates got richer and stock markets soared while the labourers lost jobs and livelihoods- how can you still trust the free market to give farmers fairer prices? It won't be long before Gujarati businessmen control the market for food, making both consumers and farmers suffer!

A waste of 30 mins of my life! I just wanted to hear good solid economic arguments and all I saw is indubitable faith in free markets, which don't give a rat's ass about farmers' livelihoods. I will not pay for your biased neoliberal journalism."

R K,"Surely good journalism requires you to point out what is likely to happen after deregulation. In the US, the 1996 Farm Bill was introduced with promises of farmers being able to sell abroad and thereby increase commodity demand. However, in 1998, 42,000 US farmers with less a turnover of less than $250,000 dollars disappeared because prices fell in 1998.  Small family farms disappeared and large corporations with deeper pockets thrived by streamlining distribution and driving prices down.  ""This is great new for the consumer"" I hear you shout. Yes maybe in the first instance, but later when these corporations whose primary aim is profit, start buying farms (which they no doubt will do) India will go the way of the US... ie, prices and supply being dictated by corporations who create virtual monopolies and offshore tax structures that benefit their shareholders and deprive Indians of proper tax revenues and choices. Yes the current system requires changing but do not be fooled by promises of exports and globalisation.  Global markets are very often more volatile that local markets. Surely a better way is to find a middle ground. Deregulate the outdated systems, but at the same time enshrine in law some method of protecting its own people from corporate greed.

kaurnavneet11,Please look at past examples....if you can see with open mind ..with due respect...Middleman is not going away....previously it is PPL...who relate to kisan...and distributed all over....but as per this law thi will increase the power of Middleman....and that too will go in few hands.. .please remember jamidara in past days ..
Kishore Singh,Liked the way you presented.. frankly I was against THE PRINT but you changed my perception. Good journalism.
angaraj gautam,"Time to unfollow you guys

Akhilesh Shastri,Amazing job explaining all these complicated stuff by cutting the clutter. I may have had a few disagreement with The Print on occasions due to some misunderstandings but the way SG elaborate s stuff I'll make amends. Subscribed again
Mr X,All these bills will ultimately lead to inflation and the final losers will be common public a day will come when dal and chaval will be more expensive than tv and fridges the monthly budget of people who are lower middle class will crash and government will have no say in it because they will have every aspect of essential services outsourced.
Anurada R,"I am sad to Comment this, Reforms in so many issues are pending, for example, Rape cases are increasing, Money laundering is increasing, Custodial deaths are increasing and many more. Why can't stringent laws be implemented and Girl child be protected with new ammendments and forcefully implied with immediate effect?
Why are we still having cases pending in Courts inspite of fast-track courts?
Why isn't inflation being controlled? Why isn't the Government being for the People of our Country? Somebody's Gain is definitely going to be somebody's loss. In this case the Government who is very selective on certain issues have to discuss it in Parliament. Why wasn't it debated in Parliament then? What was the hurry for this Ammendment? There are so many other issues like the borders being protected. They should have Protected the borders like what they have done today. Not barricading, not Nailing and digging of roads, fencing etc , with our Farmers. 
What they are doing today, they should have done before Ammendment of laws. Everything can't be taken for Granted."
Anurag Khandual,"Please cut the clutter.
If intension is to cut the clutter, the video must start with the gazette notification of the 3 laws and your interpretation about its implications. Not by inculcating the idea in our minds that how all political parties has same openion.

Please tell me what happens when people/corporates with large money can store unregulated amount of fram goods and sell it at a higher price later. In one word stockpiling."

arjun v,"That he could not see the need of MSP makes me really question his ethics.
Legalising MSP which is calculated based on surplus tally is the right thing to be done for the farmers.

And what if these pvt players form a cartel that might exploit the farmers in future?"
Jagriti,But sir don't you thick ultimately the BPL category and lower middle class will suffer...because ultimately the price is born by us....private sector can set whatever the price from the customer
Shristi Sankrit,I feel like farmers would have benefitted more had sir negotiated with the government rather than the farmer leaders
Gajendra Patel,Thank u so much sir......
rdc5470,Excellent analysis. This channel is such a relief from the cacophony of what is purportedly Indian TV News. We get in-depth analysis based on facts here rather than a shouting match between opinionated personalities on TV. Such sane journalism is a cornerstone of any civilized society and needs our enthusiastic support. I just made my financial contribution and urge others to do so as well. (I am not associated in anyway with this channel.)
Shajir Mukkam,India setting up new standard ..
aaditya gaur,Why bihar farmers poor if these laws already there ?
sukanta Chandra,"I support the amendment done in the agriculture bill. It will give market access to the farmers and liberate the farmers from the old Mandi system which is purely exploitative and embedded with corruption. While every sector has embraced reforms and privatization, why the so-called intellectuals have been living on the bread and butter of private sectors are opposing this bill."

Enagula nath,Yogender Yadav is making prejudicestic opinion out of unauthentic presumptions that sarkari mandis will collapse after a year
Ashok S,As per Yogendra Yadav a sociologist Professor feels Dr.Swaminathan report a useless one.Since when Yogendra Yadav started to believe Government organizations are spotless and no hera pehri takes place. Look at the PSU . Recently 900 crores worth of simple hand grenade and ammunition accumulated since 2014 was put it dump.
S. Kumar,"The demand Yadav is making is that penal provisions be included that, if anybody buys farm produce below MSP, he will be put to trial and punishment. In case it is done it is sure that the produces will rotten if there is oversupply in the market. Take the example of wheat. If oversupply is there for wheat (which can be easily produced), the excess produce will not be purchased by anybody due to fear of legal provisions. So the demand for penal provisions is utter foolishness. It will put especially small and medium farmers into more trouble."
Mohan Sharma,we are againts theses  bills
Amrit PAl,The rat(India Today) has been caught in the trap(Yogendra Yadav)
Samar Shinde,"Anybody got the link to the whole debate?

Also, isn't it pretty clear that Msp is levied on the produce that the govt procures(and with limited type of crops)? And the govt only procures a small quantity, others have to anyway work their way in the private market. 
I'm a mango trader(partially a famer too) and i've sold through private channels/corporates so to say, and i've made much more than i would if i were to sell through the apmc."

THOTTANKARA HARIDASAN NAIR,I am a resident of Karnataka. Take the case of Onion when the price in market is Rs. 15 and 17 the peasant get a price of 6. This is fact as of now. So why can't we try for a new system where even getting a price of 8 will be a great leap forward for the peasant.

Elder  farmers  know how to cultivate ""Desi wheat/ "" but because of  huge  cost and lack of purchasers and  less  yield as compared to varieties purchased on MSP they are helpless. But if there is assured purchase by contract farming will it benefit or harm health & economy of punjab/Haryana farmer's? Prof. (Dr.) Prem Khosla"
Vikram Sharma,"This bill is in favour of farmers , these people are distracting them."
Sadrul Huda,Modi govt doesn't seem farmers friendly..After passing the farmer amendment bill
sonu sarraf,Why you don't you bring a Kisan Leader...who better understands the ground realities. As this government has completely denied to take consultations from stakeholders in nearly every legislation. This is very worrying trend which is leading our country to a authoritarian regime. And you so called News channels has became Cheerleaders of government.
Prem Khosla,"Its unfortunate that so much falsehood is being spread against contract farming bill.
Fact of matter us that The PAFC, on behalf of the Punjab government is already promoting contract farming on a large scale to bring necessary diversifi-cation in the state. 
The PAFC is following a tripartite agreement between the farmer, the PAFC and the companies providing seeds,extension services and buy back guarantees to the farmers. 
A few other multinational and indigenous companies are also directly procuring their raw material from the farmers .
Ordinary people don't know these details and are easily mislead by emotional exploitation by ultra slogans of those who are using farmers as a tool for political goals."
Prem Khosla,"There are more than many medicinal plants/herbs that can be grown in many parts if Punjab& Haryana.
But due to lack of purchasers(/    ) a farmer can not think if growing these.
But with contract farming so many firms / herbal/Ayurveda houses will come forwards to purchase them via contract farming.P rod.(Dr.) Prem Khosla"

Aquahobbyist,Consumer is not going to get benefit in any way. New market will give entry to Adanis n Ambanis which also will bring monopoly n complete control over prices. So if farmer earlier was selling at 10rs a particular product and end consumer getting same product at rs40. In new system Ambanis Adanis will buy from farmer at may be 12rs and sell to end consumer at rs40 only. These big retailers will pocket whole profit of rs28.(which was going to various middlemen before)

Suwrat 77,"your simplicity at your best, however priya just a point; the 6% number thrown up by shantakumar committee need to have a perspective. As pointed only 22 products are part of MSP statute, so we need to understand
A) how much % of the farmer base of our country will be covered by these 22 products. 
B) Then of these subset of farmers growing 22 MSP products, the ones making use of it should be derived.
Am sure this number will be a lot higher than 6% as the base changes from all farmers to farmers coming under MSP purview."

Arvinder Singh,"Facts she stated only 6% of farmers get MSP and 81% of farmers don't know if MSP exists and Bihar farmers can sell directly to consumer, the facts she didn't disclose these 6% farmers are from Haryana, Punjab, Western UP and parts of Rajasthan the 81% that doesn't know about MSP are from states that has no mandi system and Bihar farmers are the poorest in the country with an income of 3500 per month. So unless she can explain to me how is Haryana and Punjab State govt's are responsible for these protests even when an assured MSP in mandis of Haryana and Punjab is not responsible for a better condition (compared to rest of the nation) she should keep her politically motivated opinion to herself."
Arvinder Singh,She covered most of the things but forgot the land ceiling in 60s and early 70s and how it destroyed agriculture.

Bikash Upadhaya,Your political ideology shouldn't be your genre of  content.
Sumith Singhania,"1. Why don't they reform what's already there? Remove arthiyas from the existing system and Create farmer to consumer market controlled by government.
2. Corporations are getting the control and farmer bears the risk.  You're speaking on the books, works under ideal conditions.  You claim if 50% of it's implemented, the bills will work. Which part of 50% are you speaking of?  
3. 30:47 is proof that government doesn't do what it says.  There's MSP, but government cannot mandate that Arthiyas pay MSP, how will it execute the new farm bills as promised?
4. What arthiyas are doing, how can you guarantee the companies won't do that when the bills don't protest against monopoly or Indian law.
5. 36.19 that farmers don't know MSP, every one knows in Punjab what MSP is.  You're detached from reality.
6. Nowhere you spoke of the different between marginal and rich farmers.  You're applying these bill equally to all, the rich farmer is not even impacted.  It's the marginal farmers who won't avail the empowerment bill.  They don't have the production to break even. 
- What are the monopoly laws in India?  
- What Jio did to BNSL is what Contract farming will do to APMC.
7. 48:01 - Protest is not driven by taxes, you're absolutely clueless.  Who the hell told you the farmers don't know what MSP is?   Get to know what's happening in Punjab , not your news media knowledge. 
8. APMC will DEFINITELY go away.  There is nothing in the bills that ensures APMC is going to stay.
9. You think ideal and think the companies will work with farmers.
10. 52.57 - When will this happen that MSP will be set and who will impose it on the companies? If that's the case, why isn't it dictated in the bills? 
11. 53.17 - Well then the government should have come prepared with legislative bills before passing these bills.  Do we make a baby in India before getting married? 
12. Lots of good bookish knowledge, but she's clueless, she's regurgitating what her professors taught her."
Sumith Singhania,"17:42 Yes, every country's structure is different, but United State's law and order and monopoly laws are far superior to Indias.  India doesn't even take action against monopoly.  You're overlooking crucial issues and dismissing them.  Your answer that the structure's are different is not conducive.  Please give a stronger argument why these would work in India, when they didn't work in the US or Bihar (and Bihar is already in India)."
Sumith Singhania,"11:17 How does it not matter that MSP isn't there? It affects people who grow one those 22 crops, which is majority of Punjab and Haryana."
Active One Audio,what is time stamp where you;re discussing the problems in the present farm bill ???
Sajid Khan,"I don't think farmers are there because the govt of the state they live in will have no income!! I mean come on... We have farmers on road. 
I think the farmer community has apprehensions about the ways this govt employs to do what they want. There's no wonder that they think eventually they will get rid of APMC which would mean no MSP. And then no matter how man protection you have under law, normal people won't be able to employ them to fight the corporates at times when they need it. On ground our justice system is so pathetic, that forget farmers, even a layman doesn't wanna land into that spat!! They just wanna avoid things.... All of these flaws will illuminate as this law land to reality which btw is a part of execution.
Secondly I think farmers look at MSP in a different way, they are not happy and they get a sense of insurance from that. It might look like I am irate but I am not. You do great job. I know how you inferred that why only Punjab and Haryana farmers are protesting, but it's not true.
I think there was a well established system that farmers had in Punjab which they never wanted to alter.
Few are saying that they are not farmers, instead they are middlemen who used to reap benefits during erstwhile regime and will be jobless under this act. So ya this can happen too... But still mostly they are farmers and I think only a small patch is non farmer.

I have started watching your videos,. They are very informative and really helps people be aware. This video was no exception!!"

SonYL Pandey,"The Farm bill says that ""A farmer can fix his own price for produce and they must receive payment within three days maximum as per law."" So my qstn is that for which products farmers can fix his own price? And if they can fix the price of their product s then don't you think that'll be  much beneficial for our Farmers ?"

Avinash Pal,If quality of products produced is not as per the contract then can the contactor cancel the contract
akansha singh yadav,you asked a question why haryana and punjab farmers protesting the most? what was your answer to it?
AFSAL M M,"Suppose farmers are opting for new system where they can send their produce directly to the consumers, gradually the old system wil disappear and the produce will be collected by big big pvt buisimess ppl rit? So finally the almost all produces will reach in hand of very few ppl? That can gradually leads to shortage of produces in the market increase the demand so price wil increase in the market and finally consumers wil get affect. So in long run both farmers and consumers will get affect badly and both the group will be controlled by the big shots who acts as the direct consumers in front of farmers rit?"
Gurvinder Singh,Are you sure therell be no middleman if a farmer goes outside APMC ? Is it that Adani himself will sit and buy produce for farmers directly... without any middleman ?
D N,Madam as u said that the state won't get any funds if the laws are implemented and all the revenue will flow to central but my question is where will the central will spend it? in to the nation or states right?so why is this even a bad thing?

Shoz,"Its no coincidence that the worlds oldest democracy (USA) was attacked not even a month ago, and as we speak, the most populous democracy is under assault.This is related. We ALL should be outraged by Indias internet shutdowns and paramilitary violence against farmer protesters. Militant nationalism is just a potent force in North Korea, China, as it is in India or anyplace else. It can only be stopped if people wake up to the reality that FASCIST DICTATORS arent going anywhere. Not unless:1) we organize and 2) THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES.
""Unity"" begins with truth. ""Healing"" is not possible without accountability. Stay loud. Accept nothing less. 
I also urge people not to hold all of India and all Hindus at fault for what is happening in Delhi, we can only be held accountable for our WORDS and ACTIONS and NEVER our beliefs. I love my Hindu brothers and sisters and there are many fighting with us against this oppressive regime, we are all brothers and sisters in Humanity. I still love India and will fight for what it used to stand for. The Sikhs have saved India from countless external invaders and now must fight against the internal fascists. Jai Hind. WJKK WJKF."

kiran singh,mam what is the meaning of cartel
VARUN GUPTA,"Hi! Thanks for the awesome video, I think I got most of the pointers you made pretty clearly but had some doubts and am a bit curious to know:

1. When you say only 6% of farmers avail MSP, does that mean 6% of total farmers or 6% of farmers who grow those 22 essential items that are eligible for MSP and what is this percentage at state level?
2. Most of the agitation is happening in Punjab and Haryana. Punjab I understand, it's a different government but Harayana is a BJP government. If what you said that why would these states let go off the revenue earned from agriculture, it holds true for Punjab but not Haryana. Please clarify.
3. While MSP is applicable only on 22 items, what is the contribution of these 22 items vis-a-vis total agricultural produce of the state/country (in weight/volume)?"

firstly i humbly submit that, I personally am a great great fan of both Modi Ji and Trump, the work Modi Ji and Trump to counter China/CCP/Pakistan etc is doing for this NavBharat is highly admirable and I am very Pro-Modi Ji, and he indeed is the best PM in our history of free India, also, I am not an opposition political member or any such affiliation, .... 
I hope Modi Ji Govt must withhold these reform Bills, give a thorough rethinking involving farmers inputs- let our Indian farmers not feel insecue at the hands of welcoming middlement/private traders to manage their produce - this will save the nation- will save Modi Ji dream of Nav Bharat. 
........  the fundamental issue of the protesting farmers is that, almost 99% of Indian farmers do not have adequate/requisite resources, education, internet /computer tech knowhow of paper/document works, and logistics etc to enjoy the privilege of selling their products across states, and even international markets ( selling their products overseas through shipments), ...  this is the basic Q that would need to be weighed in and  answered now by the Govt  ?? ..... 
...... obviously, these so called reform bills will enhance the role by middlemen/private traders -which is prone to all exploitations of the poor Indian farmers, these so called reform Bills will not decrease this evil role/corruption by the wealthy middlemen/traders which is well known in India, .... therefore, this is  being falsely perpetuated by the Govt that these reform bills will give more profits to the farmers as they will now be able to sell/manage marketing of their produce across states/ even internationally at theor option of setting prices for the produce  - what a hoax and deception not realizing an absolute lack of the requisite threshhold of ability of Indian farmers to do so; ...... 
 ....... on the other hand, this would  naturally welcome private traders / middlemen with their wealth,  resources, education,  tech now how, logistics etc and would be buying produce across states, global at odd times with lowest price given to the Indian farmers, thereby these private traders/middlemen  will become hoarders and this evil would be disastrous for the Indian farmers and the country;  
 ........ it is a blunder by the Govt to assume and equate our Indian farmer as to be an American farmer/farmimg ( as an illustration),  In America,  unlike our nation/Bharat/India, there are few farmers with huge farming lands and privileged with requisite resources, education, computer tech, logistics and above all America Govt has obligatory provisions - a binding by law of subsidies to the American farmers, whereby American farmers have the built-in/inheirted capacity to act as private business themselves without any middlemen so to effectively/economically manage their produce ensuring definite profit margins  ....... .....  
....... unfortunately, our IAS officials and some political leaders also who prepare such attractive blueprints of so called reform bills have no idea of poverty, lack of resources, want of education,  want of computer internet technology, lack of logistics & paper/documents works with our Indian farmers, therefore, our Indian farmers ( unlike American farmers) are not at the requisite threshold of managing /marketing of their produce by themselves .... inevitably, under the circumstances our agro-marketting is successful as totally dependent on our Govt agencies ( existing system of Mandikaran);  however, in implemnting the so called new reform bills would be distrous as it will open all possible corrupt avenues for the private traders/middlemenn with all the wealth/perhaps even black money at their disposal who will rob the farmers and thereby kill the nation, because today, the Govt is able to have full control on procurement of the produce, and storage of  the surplus produce and its regulated distribution across the needy population of the country as well as regulating the exports and even free donation to the needy world, .... .... therefore, in India ( Unlike America as an example  discussed above in here) with these new so called reform bills of management of agro-produce it is definitely aimed at welcoming private/middlemen traders to buy and sell the produce which would definitely rob/deprive the farmers of profits and that would kill the nation as well, because our nation India/Bharat is comprised of smaller land holdings but by a huge population of small farmers who do not have the requisite threshhold to enable them to act/become private businessmen in managing/marketting their produce without middlemen ( either Govt agencies or private traders); our agro-marketting is surviving because of an intensive infrastructure  of procurement, storage, distribution in place with setting of price by the Govt, .... farmers feel secure with the Govt agencies in marketing aspects of their produce, while in case of private traders no one could secure our huge populace of small farmers with smaller holdings and small produce at respective individual farmer level .... only God will save the poor farmer and poor India .... as for as GDP is concerned if a major population of a nation ( farmers) are robbed ... then forget about GDP growth curves,called reform system system will be robbed by middlemenn instead; ...... i may be allowed to reemphasize / a repetition of a paragraph above in here, viz : 
 .... 'these reform bills represents a blunder by the Govt in assuming and equate our Indian farmer as to be an American farmer/farmimg system ( as an example),  In America,  unlike our nation/Bharat/India, there are few farmers each with with huge farming lands and privileged with requisite resources, education, computer tech, logistics and above all America Govt has obligatory provisions - a binding by law of subsidies to the American farmers, whereby American farmers have the built-in/inheirted capacity to act as private business themselves without any middlemen so to effectively/economically manage their produce ensuring definite profit margins  ....... but in India/Bharat with our huge populace of small land holding farmers, our farmers at large are not inherited with  their personal / private / individual threshhold of resources, education, internet/comupter knowhow, paper/documents works, logistics requisite to enable them to manage marketing of their produce ....' 
Jai Bharat. - let us remember, Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan ( our Legelnd and Late Honurable PM Sh Lal bahdur Shastri Ji). Jai Bharat.

Rathinasamy Subramaniam,This open market policy is not new it is already there in many states even in my state of Tamilnadu it's already there that's y my AIADMK government is not opposing the bill. In many other states it's already there now it's becoming act that's all. In Punjab farmers currently farmers  can only sell to Mandis no open market policy  there that's y they are protesring that means middle men are higher and state government is heavily dependent on Mandi charges. This shows that more than the farmers Middle men are more affected.That doesnt mean there were no issues for farmers yes there but like water shortage and some other issues. I support the government wholeheartedly in this.

Gauthama Bhuddhar,Why angry? Because this govt had sold our farmers to corporate who funded for thier elections. They have no shame in doing it..non of this bill is new...its all failed model in various states...
Vellore. Venkatesan. Chandrasekaran,All the Bills are 420 bills not 2020.Corporates are another form of middle men but with money and government support. They will use the present brokers initially. Aftet chaining the farmers with agreements will utilise the present middle men who will become land brokers. Ultimately farmers will lose their lands people food security.
L Gopalakrishnan,"Well explained - clearly and concisely. The reason why people do not believe Modi's so called 'good intentions' is that he has a long  black record of defaulting on his assurances, reneging on his commitments and backtracking on his pledges. Today he says MSP will remain. Tomorrow he can change his tune and withdraw it  or render it unworkable for instance by scaling down the rates to unattractive levels."

It looks like every income for the state government is gradually removing and dependent on centre government. That is what we see in GST now.

1. India did not gain freedom or declaration of independence like US ,Nehru Jinnah signed a pact to get power transferred to north Indian Hindi speaking caste brahmins and caste muslims. The most recent transfer of power was between UPA to NDA in 2014 under 10/10 Soros evm formula ( with fb twitter whatsapp fake news ) when all state politicians pimped their representations for Delhi high command.
2. After killing Andhra Sriramulu power hungry Nehru who was not shaken even by Bhagat trio hanging, got scared and passed linguistic reorganization bill. Periyar Nayaka and Ambedkar opposed to centre formation in Delhi and as per EU model, demanded separate countries for non hindi regions but were not heard as racist British already raped and produced a slave Macaulay generation ( who are now bollywood, army and central govt employees) from north Indians.
Time to bring murderers of leaders of people - Gandhi (through RSS), and Bose (through Congress & Japan) to justice. 
3. The silencing of Periyar Nayaka and Ambedkar views for the brahmin-muslim thread-circumcision hindi casteist racist nation but eating taxes of Union needs to be tackled by non co-operation movement of not paying taxes when CJI and PM are themselves corrupt.
4. It is time for PARLIAMENT DISSOLUTION, formation of economic Union like EU and 8-10 states becoming countries for breaking this brahmin hierarchy (today 90% of all group A(civil) jobs and 51% padma(civil) awards are with brahmins ;defence jobs with those who got racially profiled by British who have terrorized nepotized and corrupted all states by calling them naxals ; private sector with their global class-caste masters - jews and British have given majority Visa to brahmins). The efficient administration can only be obtained by revolution of people of that state as and when necessary when Delhi high command is eliminated. Else all bills are intended to strengthen delhi hindi nation and break the union i.e privatize the states to serve Delhi.

In 1947 London high command trasferred power to Delhi high command. Its time to eliminate Delhi high command and reclaim Union without centre. Start civil disobedience and non cooperation."

SS Nayar,"This is only expected behaviour on the part of the BJP and their mouthpieces the speaker or dy speaker. I use the word mouthpiece deliberately. I know they are supposed to be neutral. Presiding officers in both houses, a Supreme Court which largely shies away from putting the government on the mat when required, manipulating election commissioners --- They have done it all. They believe in the tyranny of the 62 by their 38. They have this huge majority but only 38 vote share and that too because of large contributions from a few states."

x o,"Farmers bill in a nutshell. 

1 - Farmers can only sell their crops to reliance on msp.
2 - Because of the cheap msp price when they can't afford their next harvest, end up taking loans from government. 
3 - When not being able to repay the loan, end up losing their lands. 

Moreover Reliance will export all the good corps and sell the leftover at reliance fresh. 

Ambani is on the way to be the richest man in world by whatever it takes. 
Imagine how much modi govt got from ambani for issuing this bill. 
If people of India understand this much and still accept this then, sorry to say, you are stuck in the world of dictatorship.

Zoop updates,Can you make a video on 'Justice Loya' to show that media do care for Indian democracy?
DeEp ØP,"The problem with indian farmers is that they do hardwork but not well educated about the bills,technology and process. They get fooled by the retailers. And when some bill comes where the farmers get benefitted everyone thinks about themselves and not farmers and also farmers in states like bihar and UP not even consideres to go and ask what the bill is and how that works. 
Farmers protests literally include 30% genuine farmers who have their points and rest 70% are that self desirable retailers,farmers who are brainswashed by the retailers and some who had preset in thier mind that no bill can benefit them and they dont even look at wts in their bill and wt not.

The only solution to this whole matter is education and reach. If government can somehow educate people about this and help them reach the legal bodies incase of injustice. There are government schools everywhere so why not train teachers about the matter and call all the farmers for a 4 day 1 hour programme from 2 00 to 3 00 pm."

l4preet,"1. Farms didn't say they are not getting yields of crops protesting for water.
2. The government is cheating farmers by not paying msp upon delivery for there crop..as they should be doing in theory..now they just want to privatize and sellout to Adani and Ambani. Just look at what happened in Bihar!!!
3. You need to understand and listen to what the 32 kissan unions have been sitting in the streets during the winter for 3 months!!"

Ashish Malviya,"Instead of saying Artificial intelligence/technology a solution for farmers.. Talk about diversification and msp for other varieties of agricultural products.. If govt. Start providing msp for other products then the problem of water scarcity and lot more (which u r describing in ur video ) will be solved.. There are a lot of agricultural products which requires low investment and gives a good amount of profit.. But why farmers dont grow this just because of surety(msp) which they don't have like for wheat rice.. So plz suggest this solution first to the govt. It leads farmers to become ""rich""."

vikrant singh,"Talked about soloutions ....good..
Need to telll ppl why farmers are protesting ...you guys need to explain the laws too clearly....if u guys know...!!??"
Kawal Randhawa,The solution you talking about are already in use from last 4 years in punjab and immigration and being in reality is much difference and last if government is not supporting then you talk about the private sectors that are always see profit not farmers hard work in starting they give you good price and after a year or two when the goods are in large amount they drop the price and then what the farmer do where he store the goods and to get rid of it the farmer is going to sell to whatever the price is set up by private sectors and sell it to high price. The problem is buying the goods at nice price even the farmer is working 365 days in his farms to grow the crops and last what he gets because there are no minimum support price on it thats way the farmer are protesting because they dont private sector to control them.

Abishek Pappu,"You guys are great






As con artists at misleading"
Arsel,"Good research work. Keep it up.
Some more solutions: 
1. Those state have water storage shouldn't go for water intensive crops like water. Eg-punjab. Rather take crops like maize or vegetables.
2.Ag was sustainance focus bcoz in past we didn't have sufficient to feed our people. But not it should be export focus. Ans- Commercial crops
3.for export our products quality is very inferior, there's no grading . Results- max Indian surplus rice procured by FCI is wastage bcoz we can't export.
5. KVK should be giving specific targets, most scientist fool around and some work extremely hard. 
4. Apart from agriculture, livestock income can help during crop failure.
MAJOR PROBLEM IS FARMERS DON'T EASILY ACCEPT REFORMS . THEIR THINKING HAVE BEEN MOLDED IN A FORM THAT THEY CANT TRUST. Ask any of ur parents to start business, they won't take that risk at their age. 
While I was delivering a seed planting rate n tech of mustard n sunflower in a village and shift from rice to veg or oilseed bcoz their soil n less available water , some villagers started arguing that what they know better bcoz they have been doing it since age . Only 2 villagers adopt and after their profit it took the whole village 4yrs to adopt. Government incentive could have helped in making it fast."

Aman Rai,"Farmers acts........look at these facts .....
1...30-40% of fruits and vegetables get wasted in India due to lack of ''cold storage facilities ''
              If Corporate will invest in these facilities ,supply chain management , logistics,etc then definetly the prices will stablize , less wastage, employment generation( formal employment),reliable supplies ,compititive prices ,better quality,etc can be taken care of.......
   We don't trust our corporates...america does and so it has google ,amazon ,microsoft,apple,etc
Look at the movies of 70s,80s movies completely filled with labour union's leader as hero and owner of factory (who provides employment ,livelihood) as villan......

WHEN EVERY ONE FIXES THE SELLING PRICE LIKE CAR MANUFACTURES FIXES RATE WHY GOVERNMENT

GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT ENTER IN PROCUREMENT. FOR PDS BUY AT RATE FIXED BY GOVERNMENT,



PLEASE DO NOT ASK FARMERS TO SELL WHEREVER WHO PAYS HIGHEST.



PLEASE FIX SCIENTIFIC MINIMUM SELLING PRICE . FOR EXAMPLE PADDY RS. 3002/ QUINTAL,

Ye to aap khud se bol rahe ho. Aisa to kahi kuchh nhi likha. Kul mila ke ye jo virodh kr rahe hain vo kisaan nhi bichouliye hi hain jinhe pata hai ki APMC ko mandatory tag hata dene pr inki ulti seedhi kamai band ho jaegi. America ka agricultural loss bhi india ke agricultural gain se kahi jada hai . Are shuru to hone do pehle hadd hai yrr. Who is this expert giving bullshit point. The main reason behind the declination of farming in USA is their next generation is educated and developed and hence don't want to pursue careers in agriculture... go read the report . For this govt has to invest more in research and development in agriculture . But in india first we have take our farmers at that level ki unke bachhe soche ki ab unhe farming nhi karni tab problem aaegi to tab hum bhi us problem ka solution nikalenge . Ye kya bakwass reason hai ki waha model fail ho gaya ...Are you stupid ? model fail hota waha to kya unke farmers itne rich hote ? Unke bachhe aaj ye desicion le pate ki unhe farming nhi karni ab ? Hadd hai farming crisis aur model fail hone me zameen asmaan ka antar hai waha crisis hai log krna nhi chahte farming due to new generation ...Model fail nhi hua hai  go read first then listen someone else point of view and follow like a sheep.

suraj agarwal,"Whatever you are channel you need to to ask some good expert first.

Your expert itself except that only open market is not good for the economy and both US and UK has only open market in their economy.

However Government of India have not said that they will close the APMC Mandi or they will discontinue the mandi system.

So if you make a video channel or a video regarding the three farmer law.
Kindly ask yourself to talk with the proper economist economist which can relate the thing properly, economist which know about mixed economy. Neither it is said by the government that APMC Mandi will not close nor it is said that MSP would not be there.

Why farmers are protesting because their leaders are the middlemen in the money system and if government give the farmers to decide the price which they take for their crops then their leaders will lose their job and they will lose to manipulate people's mind.

Opposition leaders will lose their job Tu menu plate people's mind.

If you want to do something for the country try to find out something better do not manipulate people's mind or find some good expert not this illiterate person"

First of all they some Punjab Sikh (outside India) are using other to show Khalsa, second they have negativity over Hindu(they say Raj kare ga Khalsa and dont want to speak Hindi in family in Punjab n outside India) third, thats why they dont like current government. Thats the whole story to protest. We see them brother but some of them want Khalsa, You will get to know one day, brother. 

They brought innocent farmer at border in cold and not playing emotional card over them. Khalisatni used common Sikh feeling. Very sad.. 

II have seen and you guys and observe this, a Sikh can see themselves in there family. Its not negative or positive, just practical. 

Some of them, like Khalsa aid, serve people in the name of Khalsa not without intention of serving.

Anonymous,"Adani,Ambani &other corporates had an eye on massive food grain market of India.They had few problems:

Problem 1 : 
States had different rules & regulations 2buy food grains frm farmers. It was difficult 4corporates 2handle so many states with so many different regulations & taxes

Modi Solution:
Took control from states and made 1 act for whole country. 

Corporates happy now.

Problem 2:
Corporates will buy crops and store them. But Essential Commodity act will stop them for storing crops for long time, as it increase prices in market.

Modi Solution: 
Food crops will not come under Essential Commodity act and can be stored for longer period. Corporates again happy.

Problem 3
It was hard to determine that what type of crop will be grown by farmers.

Modi Solution:

Contract farming for farmers where they will be told by corporates to grow what kind of crop. Corporates again happy.

Problem 4 :

How Corporates will handle court cases if anything goes wrong against farmers.

Modi Solution:

Farmers can not go to courts. They will go to SDM and DC.
Corporates again happy as they can bribe them

They say bills are in favor of farmers. ....

With new market players(other private companies) coming in, In the end consumers won. Today we have better choices and quality. Similar is the case of Punjab farmers. The land is not suitable for paddy farming but with highly subsidized water and electricity they are growing it at a high operating cost. This model is survived by MSP, because that takes care of the operating cost. In this scheme other states which are more naturally adept to such farming lags behind and so is the quality of produce and economy."

Three or four Young and educated farmers in each village can make their own group  ,can have own cold storage , can have their own transport or hire vehicles and sell their yield independently in the nearby towns or adjoining states.They are free to sell their yield to any private company which gives them highest price . They may not require contract farming also if they ,themselves can run companies concurrently  .Farmers also are self employed entrepreneurs like any other big Entrepreneurs or businessmen . I feel that the New farm laws are good for farmers and hence they should invite them with full heart."

I know you tried to be rational about the on paper concept and practical application but I differ with your opinion on bill number 1. In my opinion it affects the middlemen initially and benefits farmers but in the longer run the middlemen will again start mediating between farmers and purchasers but the farmers will be at mercy of market forces once APMCs shut down due to budget contraction. Eg. BSNL.. I have been following the ground reports for two months now, mostly farmers are on the roads perhaps a little segment of middlemen is protesting too.. Hope you take a thought and review your comments about bill 1"

Amit P,"MODI gov is doing good by keeping both MSP and contracting farming . upon the interest of farmers if they realise benefit, as they find pros and cons of two over the period of time if implemented and executed. Either ways they can sell to both (mandi arthiyas, FCI or through contract farming) they can sell partially or fully or a portion of land produce. so if one farmer reaping  benefits from either of two ways or mix of two the other farmers will do the same. 
A VIRAL-FARMING ----A grant For a full liberty and liberalization , security and control. Mass-produce no problem other states will buy , under-produce no problem, in next season I will go for contract-farming. I will beat and show my fellow farmer -next door how to beat competition and flourish. A non-barrier for every range of farmers to grow and excel. These 3 laws would be game-a structural game-changer for ages.

Devanshi Trivedi,In the binding itself they can have If the price goes up they will have (50%) share from the increased price.

3- Buying from farm should be computer system based with OTP and online money transfer.

Knowledge Axis,"Punjab govt kisan ko bewkuf bana rahi hai. MSP pehle bhi tha. Aaj tak Mandi ne sirf 6% kisan ko hi msp se produce kharida. Isliye central govt ko kisan ko ek aur alternative dena pada. Central govt has made good law. Private firms cant be forced for MSP etc. It depends on demand & suppy chain. If private firms are forced, it will impact the business & companies will not take interest in dealing in such states. Mandi monopoly is not good. There should always be alternative for farmers.

Shivam,"Punjab's acts are very good and helpful to farmers. BJP (RSS) Central farms acts are extremely harmful for the farmers all over India, after 1/2 years. 

It ""encourages"" already debt ridden farmers to sell their produce in non-APMC. How? They had just state APMC to sell as they are not in a position to trade outside. 

Also, Center laws allows storing the foodstock, which will be disastrous to the farmers and consumers. It allows ""profiteering"" of Private players.

Contracting with private companies is always a bad deal for farmers after 1/2 years. Don't you know what happened in Gujrat when a some foreign company refused to pay the farmers for potatos?

Green Nation,"Looks like in states of punjab and haryana, there is great ""teamwork"" happening between traders, farmers and state governments.  So the Center should roll out the present AGRO REFORMS but allow the various State Legislative assemblies to give a thumbs up or thumbs down to it.  Punjab and Haryana and some parts of UP want to continue the current STATUS QUO and their State Legislatures will deliver that to them.  In ALL other States of India, the AGRO REFORMS have been very well received especially those who know what is there in these AGRO REFORMS."
Mohnish Chaudhary,"Please provide reference on the mentioned ""unlimited storage"" clause. From what I gathered the bill still applies stock limits, but instead now has defined criteria to do so instead of bureaucratic determination and application. Bill also mentions the reasoning for doing so - provide defined rules for private players to boost their confidence and encourage their investment in building storage capacities."
Mohnish Chaudhary,"The underlying problem that presenter highlighted in most of the drawbacks is - ""apprehension that govt. would abandon and cease to exist as a player, hence leading to exploitation by private entities"". But the government has assured that it would not cease to exist as a player and included strong provisions to protect the farmer in various situations. Further, if market forces resort to such behavior, govt has tools and capabilities to further enact the laws to protect farmers interests. But based on this apprehension alone, is it fair to disallow the private players who could reduce inefficiencies in the system and portrayed successful co-operative movements like Amul and others? Plus we have examples where govt. continues to exist as a player alongwith private entities - airlines, power, oil, telecom, banks etc."
Mohnish Chaudhary,"18:05 - Couple of points. 1) If contract done for 2000, company can't arbitrarily reduce price afterwards and have to honor it as per the rule. 2) If company offers contract price of 500 (down from 2000) for next contract, why the presenter says that the farmer doesn't have a choice? The farmer is still free to contract with someone else offering higher price OR he/she may choose to cultivate whatever and sell it in APMC at MSP price - as that structure is still present.

Now that's for theory. However, on a realistic level, what produce does the company hope to secure by offering 500 for something standardized at 2000? Do they plan to disrupt their model and go out of business without the raw product?  So, this 75% price reduction seems far fetched. Ultimately demand and supply forces balance things. If companies offer 1500 and less farmers contract for that price leading to less supply, demand rises and players emerge to offer more than 2000 now. The company offering 1500 finds itself in a touch spot now with lost reliability and fewer contracts."

An IIM topper went to Patna to sell veggies and became a millionaire, farm bills would give same opportunity to all farmers


The three bills would free-up the farmers to sell the produce directly in the market, minimize the government power to regulate the stocks of essential commodities which includes various agricultural products, and formalize contract farming. These bills would cut the middlemen and improve farmers income, but, the opposition including Congress which promised to introduce the same reforms, are now opposing these bill andmisinformingthem for their petty politics."

Manas Ranjan Mohanty,"Govt. needs to initiate formation of platform for farmers in order to manage the agriecosystem with pricing policy as prevails in industrial sector. In fact, pricing policy for home market needs to be uniform for all products. This will safe guard equal opportunity for all citizens. Each one's time will fetch equal monetary remuneration. But,  I don't mean a work of higher importance will not be rewarded. It has got to be rewarded with out being monetary directly. It may be facilities that provide ease of life like services for which financial expenditure may be incurred by nation. Well,  coming back to agri policy, following points may please be considered for debate. 
1. An all India agri organisation be formed to formulate policies for farming, collection of yields, stocking of yields and distributing to consumers. 
2. Policies for farming:
a)  Each acer of land should be assigned a set of crops  time of cultivation. 
b)  Required money and material input should be provided to farmer if desired by farmer. 
c)  All the yield will become earning of farmer with the apex body being custodian of all yields of all farmers from all lands. Farmer can hold part of full yield for his or her home consumption with refund of input cost availed from apex body with interests if any. 
d)  Farmer can only sell the agri yields to the apex body at the price calculated by apex body based in particular with pricing policy adopted for other products of market. It is note worthy that pricing policy needs to be only one for home market covering the total nation. 
e)  It is of utmost importance that uniform pricing policy will actually reflect the contribution of farmers to GDP which is deliberately lowered by manipulated pricing system prevailing in the country. 
f)  Assets value of the apex body will be the total earning - inputs by govt.  for  formation of apex body-expenditures on input costs for technical guidance and collection and stock handling of yield till disposal in market. 
g) The net value of the apex body is the combined value of all farmers of the nation. 
h)  Each farmer will have it's agrivalue based on quantity of land utilised and can be availed any time with help of banking system integrated with apex body and it's farming community. 
I)  There should be no political interference and no political representation should be tolerated. It will work as an economic institution of govt.  of Bharat under PMO only. 
j) Basic policies should not be changed. But,  additional options may be introduced for safety of farmers and the organisation. 
K)  Tax factor must be considered to be imposed in order to maintain that farmers are not only feeders of the society but also tax contributors for development of nation. 
These are few points of consideration for making a better nation with happy and creative citizens."

Nanu,I intuitively knew that this bill is in favour of farmers so didn't watch any videos on this subject but today I came to know that Rakesh Tikait is planning to go to Lucknow and bring instability on our Independence day so I decided to know everything in detail about it and a teacher like you is best to understand such a complex subject from.

Abhi Shah,"This wasn't good at all, unless preparing for an exam. You didn't explain it thoroughly. You only covered the theoretical points in the bill. They are written by professionals writers, of course it will sound good on paper! What we need is someone who can understand the whole context, history, supporting and opposing views, fact check, analyze real data and then presend their final case (for both side).

This is really showing half the picture, and half knowledge is more dangerous than none. You're really doing more harm than good."

Vivecan Stan,Punjab farmer will become more rich and prosperous if they carefully understand the bill like Western Countries' farmer. Farmers should be little patient instead of assuming as if MODI is some representative of Ambani/Adani. Modi is 70 year old and he doesn't need money from Ambani and Adani. Stop blaming Modi. Modi is transforming India so that farmer's generations in future can continue to be proud farmers of India with richness and wealth. Modi is bringing India at par with Western economies. Farmers are misinformed. Modi is cleaning up mess of Congress and Corruption. Modi doesn't work for any Ambani and Adani.

They don't have the proper resources to sell their products to the farther places as this will need huge transportation cost which small farmers can't bear even if they are getting high prices. Secondly, selling to the traders at farther places will not provide payment security that they will get their money on time. Thirdly, the market is just like the stock market they have to wait for good price , but unfortunately, very few have proper place to store their grains .
Government's intention is not wrong but there are some loopholes in the bill."

arakkal muhammed,"This government is selling India to Adani and Ambani, and in the face of opposition to this move by the agrarian and monopoly capitalists, I will face 'Pakistan and China' with my 56-inch chest, crush the jihadists and say 'Aarsha Bharat culture' again, and become 'poor Narayanans' again. .. Even if it is a farmer who returned to Bandara due to government policy and bought poison at home. If the government gives relief to 6000 farmers on the eve of elections, then all is well .. then we can give relief again before the next election ...

The BJP in India has a problem that can only be solved by spreading hypocritical nationalism and racism in Pakistan and China. The Indian public consciousness has changed so much.

As long as the BJP can easily convert the votes of dalits, bridesmaids, Chandalans and Eezhavas into ""Hindu"" votes in India ruled by ministers who proudly claim to be a non - onion eating caste, 'anti-jihadi' love laws will continue to prevail in India. Prohibition of notes, gst, amendment of citizenship, for example .. Most Indians today have the rage (common sense) to say that everything is an arrangement to rehabilitate jihadists."

       I am Regularly visiting the APMC in the state of Karnataka for my house hold requirements. Here most of agricultural products are procured near to market and the price of product is very nominally good to consumer and quality of product is very fresh. Of course there is middle man in every field and Organisation. Even to procure defence equipment from other countries the Governments based  on middle man. But these are call as consultants. One more important thing that the farmers cultivate according the food habits of local population this give benefit to both farmers and consumers....The laws made by the central government not in the position to give any helping hand to marginal and small farmers and who are account more than 80% of farmer population."

Does electricity prices not increase for us?! Does diesel cheap for us?! Does we buy tractor and other tool for free?!..

If you have any suggestions and plan to solve this problem then only speak else shut your mouth..

If government really want something for farmers then plz install solar panels at cheap or free.. build cold storage and storage in each village ..make supply chain to reduce farmer exploitation... (currunt scheme take long time for processing our application)

Jithu M,A great piece of legislation in an idealistic society which we are not. The passage without votes shows the death of democracy. The bill which has been applicable in MH and Bihar has never helped any Farmer is a fact. One can only hope such idealistic things will be good to farmers' interests and not corporates in our de facto authoritarian country. I wonder how illiterate farmers will be able to sign complex contracts with corporates without knowing they are not on the wrong end of such contracts. Will anyone let alone farmers be able to fight such corporates in a court in the case of violations of such contracts?

It will give every farmer assurance & peace of mind.Just a simple issue,gov can include that point in law.Now after this much protest,PM is lecturing , but why gov refrained to include this point in law?

Laws are there for providing justice at any cost.Everyone can be happy,but  its like crushing democracy in parliament & when pressure created by protest,they have raised the MSP ,that too lowest raise in last 11 years.
Take a example...We know that no one can harm us & if anyone harm us,they must have to be punished,& for that, a law is important for common man to fight for justice."

Prashant Vanave,Thanks
Manpreet Kaur,"I am still having certain doubts about it
1. Let say through privatization competition will increase, but what is the guarantee that competition will inc the price of produce for farmers. Ex let's say companies providing 100 for a produce when msp is let's say 120, now mandis middleman will join companies in long run as why would they buy from farmers with at least 120 rs. So In long run it will effect mandi system as whole. Let's admit small farmers don't have power to argue with companies and now it will open competition.
2. Regarding stock holding: for big farmers they can store their crop and sell it later at high price. For small farmers, middleman will take and store and sell at higher price. Earlier let's say stock limit was 100 , but now no stock limit as hoarding can be done easily. So take produce from farmers at low cost,store it and sell it.
3. Regarding contract farming: let's say small farmers produce 10 quantal and companies need 100 quantal so instead of buying from him, company will buy from big farmer.
Open competition does not help always, I guess milk open competition was successful due to formation of cooperatives.
 Pls give your view regarding this."
siddhant raj,"It was a very informative session.
The point that Prof Chand made 'Competition will take care of all stakeholder'. But my point is that competition  should start from a common start point. Do you people think that a small farmer will able to compete with the corporates?"

Prakhar Ki Pathshala,"A very productive discussion 
But today here you did not call anyone who opposes the bill and can come out with the drawbacks of the bill. One such is no mention of MSP in the bill ,govt should make compulsory for both private and govt. itself to buy crop at MSP."

nimisha gupta,"People complaining about no critic in the panel, don't you have any video regarding that. Look up and you would find thousands of critics. And mind you less than 5% would be actually having knowledge about the actual situation. If you are so keen on knowing the criticism my advice would be to first hear the pro and then lend your ear to critics as much as you want, you may swim in the river of criticism as long as you want. Mind you, you won't find quality criticism."

Samarth Graphics,"If competition was to take care, there would have been no need of PSUs... going for invisible hands is good but for the sensitive, risky sectors like agriculture should be based on facts rather than mouth talk only...farmers do not have bargaining power to face private companies ...and perishability of farm produce will force again to distress sale ( right now also happening the same, it's just rather than middle man the beneficiary will be capitalists now, hence this bill will not have drastic change for farmer but to **** marts coming in market as e commerce)...other produce are not perishable hence for that invisible hands can work but in case of agriculture only cashier's hand are working."
Aakash Singh Kaira,Kindly increase the run time of this show and do bring in a more balanced panel eventhough the points were good but there wasn't really a proper debate btw opposing views.

Arjun Tyagi,"1-Famers become price taker to price maker.
2- bargain with commercial group.
3- with the help of e- commerce  they can become traders.
4-review provision if the price increase due to some conditions.
5- can lead to large economic activity in rural areas.
6- do not effect msp(administrative law)system they are legal law.
7- ignited by middle man ( punjab , haryana) as  they have good hold. No other state have any murmur.
8- state revenue will have loss.7000 crore in Punjab.
9- farmers will have choice. (Milk is sold everyday)( people have choice to sell lo ocal sender, amul)
10- extension and expansion of what is done by UPA.
xxxxxxxxxincruxxxxxxxxxxx"
Suyash,Once again very sensible and information full discussion
navdeep boparai,This discussion could have been more comprehensive if you would have  included any farm representative in ur panel
Abhishek Gupta,Where is frank?  I miss him on big picture
History for civil service,"Unfortunately representative of farmers is absent.
1. Example of milk is good but market works on demand and supply. In case of wheat and rice, production is high and thus open market may not provide much. Other side, both commodities are part of NFSA and are subsidised by govt.
2. Though farmers can sell in open market, but cost of storage, transport is high.
3. information assymetry will be against farmers
4. In Punjab and Haryana, middlemen are providing credit to farmers in need though on high interest rate but it is better when no other option is available to get money without collateral
5. Issue of selling product anywhere - at ground level state govts. create barriers. e.g. recently Haryana has banned  paddy and Bajra from U.P and Rajasthan.
6. Is it true that private players will invest in physical infrastructure for farmers in markets. They will come just for making money.
7. Though it will not end MSP but in future, state governments may be reluctant to buy on MSP. It is real fear among farmers of Haryana and  Punjab.
8. The govt. itself should end middlemen and give legal status to MSP.
9. What will happen when govt. ban export of agriculture commodities to control inflation. It is against very idea of open competition."
Nithin Chand,These reforms will transforms the agriculture into more corporatizing...comment
Warrior Girl,Conclusion is that  this bill is panacea for our Indian farmers  nd I must say bjp nvr think about thr vote banks which is more attrctv .. I supoort this bill
Karan Gawade,what example did mr sandip das gave about pune mandi? The name is unclear.
simran kaur,Prof. Ramesh Chand has explained very very nicely...good to see such an intellect in NITI Ayog
Prof MG Chandrakanth Mysore,"Prof Ramesh Chand, kudos for an excellent presentation which has allayed all apprehensions regarding the provoked fear in the minds of the farmers that with the new law, APMCs may vanish and MSP too. You have made it abundantly clear that the new law has nothing to do with the APMCs which is a state subject, as it only permits the farmers to either sell at APMC or outside APMC without paying any commission, and it also permits any farmer,  group of farmers, producer group themselves can act as trader integrator, to collect, process, pack and sell. In addition you have also mentioned that there is no compulsion on any farmer to sell any crop including fruits and vegetables in the APMC and they can sell any where without paying any  market cess.  You have also made it clear that it is the competition which is the greatest protector of all stakeholders. 

Except 2 - 3 states, APMC act is in all States for notified commodities, where a farmer needs to bring produce to APMC yard for its trade. If a farmer would like to sell at his farm gate or elsewhere he was not permitted to sell. It is also true that no one could purchase from farmers directly and any one with a permanent account number can get involved in marketing. Therefore hitherto farmer had to sell only and only through APMC channel. Since the last 18 years discussions were going on reg changes to be made in this Act to enable farmers providing flexibility. So after long thought after discussions, debates, in this new Act, flexibility or options are provided to farmers to sell wherever, to whom ever at a price agreeable between farmer and buyer, and this allows farmer/s to bargain; It also provides for electronic platform, and thuspvt players can set up e platform and farmers can make use of them. Farmer with permanent account number or farmer group can buy as a producer group or as trader to integrate, collect, process, pack, which can free farmer completely from binding of sale at APMC. APMC mandis will be intact since they are governed by state APMC Act. There will be multiple avenues for farmers to sell. Direct purchase reduces transaction costs substantially.
The second bill is on contract farming, where farmer's price insurance is considered. Punjab had contract farming act which was not comprehensive. A small farmer who has no access to tractor or capital, could enter into agreement with any agribusiness firm and sell the produce at pre detrmined price which is again subject to review, if there is increase in price of produce, the farmer will not be put to disadvantage. it will also enable contract with processor/s with the farmer and this leads to large economic activity in rural areas especially in (primary) processing. These two bills will not affect MSP including procurement in any way. MSP is not a law, it is an administrative decision of the Govt.he provision of purchase outside APMC will also make mandi merchants in APMC competitive. Farmer is now freed from the clutches of middleman. If processor can access farmer directly and he assures a quality product, it can be done thru contract farming.
How the farmers' interest and of other stake holders are protected. : Competition itself is the best protector of stakeholders. Farmer now can choose multiple channels for sale. These multiple options will themselves act as protection. More than 10 crore people sell milk every day 365 days, worth Rs. 8 lakh crores annually, without any APMC, without any dispute. Because of competition, such as cooperatives, pvt vendors, but with no disputes. In case disputes, the institution such as FPO, the State machinery will take care.Fruits and Vegs have been taken out of APMC. In Maharashtra, maha grape, maha mango are dealing with these crops. Now there is no compulsion on anybody to sell any crop in APMC, not necessarily fruits and vegetables. So this is just an extension of UPA policy which said exclude Fruits and Vegetables from APMC. Agribusines or contractual firm has to pay 1.5 times to farmer if they back out. With privatization, competition will increase and protect the stakeholders. Because of contract farming, the quality of produce will also improve."
Ravi Bhushan,Panel should have been manned by one eminent person from agitating farmers side.
Vijeta Tiwari,"They all who unknowingly criticised Bill they are conservative in nature I think they dont want change in the society 
They still believe in persistence of traditional way"
DillipKu Jyoti,Biased Indian Government(BIG) picture...should bear balanced view before winding up..
VIVEK SINGH,most of the time the speaker was from niti ayog.... n it was a bias debate....no offence
Shakil Reza,Totally biased panel
Purnendu Sabar,Why don't you allow other panelists who have different point of view on this. Are you also scared of govt to invite panelists who have different point of view.
Tarun Bhatia,Alonk sinha is wrong there are protest through out the country. why there is no counter side in debate?? RSTV acting like godi media these days. utterly disappointed.
Abhyuday Sharma,I'm so laughing on the attempts by Mr dahiya.
Me - '-,Stress is still there in dairy industry
Rohit,Ramesh chand in the beginning was like educated Sambit Patra.............
Satya Vir,"It would be better if u must have a farmer's representative in the panel, Mr. Dahiya. The agriculture is collapsing because such bureaucrats and agriculture expert r making policy and acts, who have nothing to do with agriculture prictically but have theoritical bookish knowledge. Such people r busy in kissing the feet of their political bosses. If these acts have potential of revolutionizing agriculture than the farmers of Europe and America would be prospered who are rather in far worse conditions than their Indian counterparts.Even farmers of Bihar have prospered which have these provisions already. Agriculture can't prosper unless right people are placed at bureaucratic and other agriculture related posts and work with synergy and commitment.
And one advise to such so called experts,  upcoming generations of farmers will ask you; why were you so desperate in ruining the future of farming with your limited bookish knowledge and habbit of kissing the feet of your political bosses for opportunitism?
It is the mere the tectis to do away with the MSP/subsidy  which is putting a burden on government fiscal health due to food security act. This country can't afford food subsidy to 67% of its population. It would have been better if you have decreased the no of subsidised food beneficiary from 67% to 25% genuine poors.
You would  never be succeed in your misadventure to provide food subsidy to 67% of population at the cost of farmers.
Thanks
A farmer"
Romil Mahant,"Good example of Fruit and vegetables,, It is the real successful example of this act, other experts on study channels lack the understanding of real mechanism of farming system in India."
Musavir Nazir(MNM),"this is an imbalanced episode, in the same fashion as was the procedure adopted in rajya sabha to pass these bills  .  the fact that oppositions were debarred to enter to daily business of the house,  the same case here adds ooops to my astonishment."
sushant raj,talk did not have space for the small and marginal farmers
sushant raj,There should have been atleast one penalist from farmer organisation for his opinion. still ambiguous
Yogita Kukreja,This was a biased discussion in my opinion..No opinion on the possible downsides of the bills... Should have been a more balanced ..these bills are not full proof
RAMENDRA Dwivedi,Rajya Sabha is lossing it's credibility ..not balanced debate.
A K,this intellectual experienced panel would have discussed if they find any flaws. what required is a proper complaint redressal machanism for farmers where even a small farmer can put his grievances and get justice in a time bound manner.
A K,"the hindu trademark for upsc has been changed and you can find indian express, live mint to some extent provide well articulation of subjects."
A K,"if a farmer feels he cant bargain then he will better go to mandis to get his product sell with MSP. 
the point is if no one has problem with the way milk market functions then why there is foul cry for this extension."
Yogita Kukreja,Every time professor Chand said: Dahiya ji ..I smiled :)

MIDHUN M,There was no debate today. Just advantages of act is discussed. Disappointed
Shiv Kumar,Sir are agree to this  bill provided benfit of farmer
purushottam kumar,"There is only one biggest concern for farmers, that is having less bargaining power than wealthy buyers, they might end up getting lower price. And thus making MSP legally binding on buyers can safeguard the farmers' interests."
akshay ugale,Counternarrative is altogether absent.....We want more balanced panel.
Yash Verma,This panel doesn't deserve the quality of big picture. Farmer is not bound to sell there produce in apmc mandi. He is also sell the product in village or in open market.
anil kumar,Thank you
Pragya Rajput 1034,"Very nicely explained.... But kind of one sided, could have had a member of the akali Dal as well to justify all these protests."
DD,"The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020
	 Allows trade of agricultural produce(includes, milk, eggs, fish, etc) outside APMCs. 
	 Provision of E-commerce facility. 
	 Farmer can also act as a trader.
	 Does not affect MSP in any way. It is an administrative decision. 
	 Will make middleman, the state tax on Mandis irrelevant. Most of the agitation concentrated in Punjab and Haryana since their hold of middlemen is stronger.
	 Competition is the bigger helper. For example, Milk being sold lucratively even in the absence of APMC. 
	 Quality will increase. 
The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020. 
	 Contract Farming- Selling the goods at a predetermined price, also access to inputs.
	 Push to Food Processing Sector. 
	 Too much protection given to the farmers.

More over the issue is a structural change so wider discussion and concessus is needed which not taken care.its is like demotivation and GST implementation which slump the economy ,now who will care for farmer and consumer ? Panel must be balanced to stakeout all the pros and cons."

Narendra Kumar,"I welcome APMC act 2020.

murali nadigatla,"These 3 farm laws which your discussed about pre and post agriculture and then markets,
The Indian economy is  largely rely on agriculture earlier but now the situation arises across the world the country's not only depend on agriculture but also invest in processing of food industries.
If India want to become a world's super power must consider all the sectors before going in to the growth cycle, 
India is a land of diversity as both in case of agriculture and in case of crops culture, the farm laws appropriately connected india in to the world through the food and culture,
But when the government takes any decision regarding the county's development and makes the laws must consider all the stack holder's included in the law,
The appropriate solution to this farmers crisis' is to pass the ordinance to hold the laws until the farmers will aggre,
Create awareness regarding the laws on grass root levels,
Empower the farmers to know the benefits of the 3farm laws,
Create a corporate friendly environment to the farmers build the trust in with the farmers,
The duty of the government is to provide support and facilitate what the peoples need."

ABHISHEK KUMAR SINGH,"One Question : Under essential commodities Act as discussed that we try to bring down the High prices of those commodities which are essential for the consumers. So we include that commodity under essential commodities act and hence keeping a check that no stock of that commodity is maintained beyond a stipulated limit. 
BUT when there is boost in a harvest of a commodity then traders do not want to procure large quantity bcoz due to the essential commodities act there is a limit set for the stock to be maintained.
BUT don't you think that if government notice that since considerable amount of time there is the boost in the harvest of essential commodity than they remove that commodity for Essential commodities Act bcoz since the harvest has grown up the prices will not go high as the supply gap is filled and now there is no need to keep that in the list and put a limit on the stock to be maintained !

So can government bring out the commodity out of the list which was previously included due to low supply and high demand leading to the high pirce ?"

prasad karthik,"What I have to say is that the agricultural sector in India clearly needs reforms. Agriculture sector badly needs high-end technologies, digital tools, entrepreneurs and farmer organisations to provide services to farmers. But the framework to reform it should also provide adequate safeguards to the farming community and clear out their doubts and fears. They should not be left to linger in concerns about the enactments. Necessary changes can also be made upon consultation and hearing their views because they are are the ones, without any bad influence of dirty politicians."

The problem is with taking the knowledge till farmers and make them understand. In 2019, Many opposition and farmer groups protested to implement this act. The best way to analyze this act is by implementing it for a year. This should be studied as a case study after implementation but not on assumptions"

How Pakistan is investing in this protest
Pakistan is transferring money to Canadian Khalistani organization and where they both collect money and transfer in india for protest as well as in india, money is collected from opposition party, middleman,anti aliment muslim, khalistani sikh.
What's will be effect from them by protest
1. Pakistan will effect Indian economy by internal riots without Pakistan military attack
2. Indian Muslim and Sikhs can stop India to become hindu rastra
3. Opposite political party can defeat bjp and make own government
4. Sikh will agrue from  in the name of bjp.
Their strategy to stop voters to vote bjp
1. Say them bhagat
2. Say them bjp it cell
But all we know now that's their in comments section 80% Pakistani it cell + khalistani it ce ll is working and if others comments in favour of bjp government then they will say it's bjp it cell or godi media .
But internally 80% khalistani and Pakistani it cell is working so that they can increase riots in india.
Be aware from Indian name I'd in comments they all are Pakistani but have made Indian named id so that they can make fool to Indian youth"

Also we can evidently observe that it's not a tight packed crowd. All the dalals who are going to get hurt by these laws have gathered here. But it will do anything as farmers from other states are very much opressed by previous APMC mandi. And tht why no real kisan is against these farm laws. We all have seen how some handful of jamindaars, dalaals and land mafias have monopolised the whole system. I personally experience this in Delhi. So be calm and support these laws."

Nankana is the birthplace of Guru Nanak the founder of Sikhism. So, for how long will our homeland keep calling us??? Come on brave brothers let us move back home to Lahore, Pakistan. Forget India. Lets go OUR REAL, HISTORICAL, GURU-GRANTED HOME: LAHORE, PAKISTAN. RAJ KAREGA KHALSA. I repeat, brave Sikh brothers, let us never forget that the real home of Sikhs granted by our Guru and the capital of sher-e punjab is Lahore and not India.

That is unbearable pain as if from the whole body for about a minute, it would be really agonising for the animal. Spinal cord is highway of pain sensations.

Ab by,"Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses seat. So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other peoples shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.
Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called Rabbi by others. But you are not to be called Rabbi, for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth father, for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted"".

YOU SHALL NOT MAKE FOR YOURSELF AN IMAGE in the form of anything, in Heaven above or in the Earth beneath, or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents up to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.

If my people who are called by my name, humble themselves and pray, AND TURN FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS, I will hear from Heaven, will forgive their sins, and will heal their land.

AND WHEN YOU PRAY, DO NOT BE LIKE THE HYPOCRITES, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. BUT WHEN YOU PRAY GO INTO YOUR ROOM, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.

This, then, is how you should pray:

Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your name,
your kingdom come,
your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts,
as we also have forgiven our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from the evil one.

For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.

""Matthew 5-7 NIV Bible Gateway"", we can use google search.
These are the teachings,
The Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ our God.
REPENT, and start doing what is right.
If you abide my teachings, you are really my disciples; then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.

Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in Truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.
GOD IS SPIRIT so his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in Truth.

In the New Heaven and New Earth,
only Righteousness dwells.
May the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God be with you all."

Pakistan is transferring money to Canadian Khalistani organization and where they both collect money and transfer in india for protest as well as in india, money is collected from opposition party, middleman,anti aliment muslim, khalistani sikh.
What's will be effect from them by protest
1. Pakistan will effect Indian economy by internal riots without Pakistan military attack
2. Indian Muslim and Sikhs can stop India to become hindu rastra
3. Opposite political party can defeat bjp and make own government
4. Sikh will agrue from  in the name of bjp.
Their strategy to stop voters to vote bjp
1. Say them bhagat
2. Say them bjp it cell
But all we know now that's their in comments section 80% Pakistani it cell + khalistani it ce ll is working and if others comments in favour of bjp government then they will say it's bjp it cell or godi media .
But internally 80% khalistani and Pakistani it cell is working so that they can increase riots in india.
Be aware from Indian name I'd in comments they all are Pakistani but have made Indian named id so that they can make fool to Indian youth."

Nothing matters to them

Irrespective of selection , it's disrespectful towards doctors and would be doctors

How service doctors will cross from district to exam center during LOCKDOWN flood

They don't care bother , and putting 20L doctors and plus2 students and around 1 cr relatives friends life at risk

They will spread Covid19 and won't mind 3rd wave even as it will postpone reelection further

When they should have solely focused on 1cr/day vaccination for next 2 month to ensure 50% of population get vaccinated 

and can conduct NEET UG PG SS FMGE in November easily 

IMA must tell to postpone examination till November

HONBLE CM must ensure in 2022 JEE( MED) PGMED is conducted for STATE UG PG seats like before 

And for all India , dnb , private seats let them conduct NEET UG PG SS exams like JEE ENGG & IIT MAIN coexist

Disrespectful towards doctors before examination won't be accepted by physician and common public both 

Effect will surely be felt in 2022 ELECTIONs

Better they vaccinate 1 cr/day to vaccinate 50 percent  population in next 60days

 As if 3rd wave emerge before Diwali ,  not only economy but 2022 ELECTIONs will give DISASTER"

at max they will get 55% of the total seats and slightly kesser vote share and the biggest dent they will face will be in khari boli region of UP.

given the fact i am repulsed by bjp-rss narrative theyve been running for a while, yogi has done a great job when it comes to law and order and infrastructural upgrade.

also the recent investments in the defence corridor of UP have been a great move too, all in all, yogi has been a good cm and he has avoided giving out crap statements against the farmer movement."

The thing is these 3 bills are loophole for eachother.
Indirectly gonna make farmers servants in their own farms.!!
Bill no. 1 - says any one can store any amount of ration.. for example someone having huge warehouse can store anything for example they stored onions and can potray that there no onion in market . Thus after that selling it at higher price later. For example , around 2-3 years, potates were almost sold for 1-2 ruppee for kg, now guess how much u bought it for?
These warehouse owner will make farmers wait until they crush buying price and then they will wait until they sky high the selling price!!
This is generall explanation tho, for deep understanding read bills carefully.
 I dont know why common people not get this, that this will Eff them too!!"

ajit singh,"The problems that the farmers are facing wont be limited to the farmers alone, they will next show up in the general society as well. The current government has succeeded in placing the future of the next generation of children of this country into deep slavery by promoting endless privatization, transferring wealth to the riches, performing changes in rules that were protecting the democracy so far. 

Modi and Shaw either do not understand or are deliberately helping the traders and the corporate owners by privatizing everything. In a corrupt environment, Punjipatees will become infinitely rich after eliminating the small professions/professionals the corruption, greed and fear in the system will help in exploiting the corporate employees and workers to no limits. They will use greed/fear, reward/punishment tactics in hiring/firing and controlling salaries of their employees. They will exploit the self desire for existence to the extent that a PHD scientist may be forced to work as a Clark and a janitor may be hired as his boss. People will destroy each other while fighting for their existence in order to make their monthly payments for medical, vehicle, home and retirement insurances, house tax, state tax, federal tax, house mortgage, vehicle payment and on top of that the fear of losing job, breaking marriage not being able to pay for their children education will remain every second they live a life of slavery. That is the future in a corrupt system where politicians will have to beg the corporate owners for their existence and the corporate owners will keep on doubling their wealth every year regardless of what happens. This is the extreme picture when corruption, fear and greed exists in the  society to extreme limits destroying the freedom and democracy of the country. Wake up Rashterwadio it is already too late drop your religious differences and save your childrens future. It's in your hands today and farmers are showing you by protesting and fighting for their future existence!!"

While the country is vast, it is necessary that the sizeable Southern part is not left uninformed. There seems to be little awareness in the States  of AP, Karnataka and Tamilnadu or even in Kerala. In Telangana, CM KCR is repeatedly announcing that his Government wont implement the new Farm Bills as they go to harm the interests of farmers. Excepting this, there is little commotion in Southern States. Generating opinion in Southern States will be an important element for the success of farmers. Country shall speak with one voice. Or else there will be doubts about the reasons and motives of the movement."

Among them people belonging to Jat community , they are actually Khalistani supporters . And most of the sikhs reached at delhi are from this community . App agr 2-4 se bhi personally puchoge ki khalistan bn'na chahiye , they will 100% say 'Han bilkul' . Aur public mei puchoge to bolenge aap log hmare protest ko deliberately khalistani agenda se jorh rhe ho . This is truth .

Cyber007,"The bane of this country is not it's illiterate population. It is the educated population whose degree is not worth the piece of paper it is written on, but it pontificates on everything under the sun. And oh, their bleeding hearts, aren't they the epitome of empathy and kindness?! Never mind that their crocodile tears, are blurring their vision. 

Again and again, some unruly and stubborn group of people, holds the entire nation ransom to have its way and it is applauded. Selfishness in this nation, is a celebrated virtue if you belong to certain spectrums of the society which can be hijacked for political causes. All this why? because the well meaning people would rather cling to an emotional humdrum and be conveniently lazy about reading and thinking. 

India bleeds with a thousand cuts, one ill-intentioned rebellion at a time.

Gov't is giving that freedom to farmers to sell where they get good price than congress law where farmers have to sell for less cost to tied APMC worker and middle man APMC makes money.
How can congress at ground level fool people to protest against farmers to fight with government farmers law. 
Will same APMC workers tomorrow ask government to remove 42 amendment Preamble in the constitution which was passed 1976 without people of India decision. Congress party should understand it's not British era to let farmer stay poor. Government is passing this law to help farmers who are poor since independence."

-- Who is funding this agitation?
-- If farmers are funding, it means farmers are very rich. Why should they be paid MSP?
--- They want to show off their power. Why dint they show their power during , operation blue star, or jailian walabaugh, or anti Sikh riots in Delhi?

the public is the judge, judge the institution and their wisdom.  bribery is nothing to laugh, but people have in the past,  that's why things have got so worse now      ....know this  people, bribery is a felony and unlawful, report and here should be FIR against these people and not against innocent farmers...

They cannot lead a life of dignity thereafter.  This is very clear what they see as the greater evil and threat.  Situation should now be defused by repealing the three laws. It will create a positive atmosphere in the country if the MSP demand is acceded to.  Country cannot be happy when our annadhaatas are unhappy and on the roads."

Oh, ya, like we all know, these guys usually have too much money so they aren't scared of the protest with a stupid hidden agenda. Grow up guys."
Ishpreet Kaur,"What happened that day is an expression of dissent by the farmers who have been peacefully protesting for 2 months and losing their loved ones amid cold and covid. Almost 150+ farmers died in the protest. The government passed the laws amid covid and declared postponing it just days prior to Republic Day for their reputation. They care less for the farmers and more about their image. Police clearly fired unprovoked tear gases to the peaceful protestors and the whole mess began. Thats a ground report ! Protestors were seen distributing water bottles to police and protecting female police from the chaos. Yes they hoisted their Sikh faith flag but whats wrong with that? The National flag was way up higher and untouched and the Sikh faith flag is a reminder of the dissent of farmers who have heard zero response from their democratic prime minister about the farm law protests since day 1 as if pretending the country is well and stablilised. Guess what? The government stopped/slowed Internet services in the capital to prevent the authenticity of the day get out! 


I would request everyone to check @sikhexpo page on Instagram. They have the ground reports and tell the whole truth. The media twisted the narrative as always. Trust me, as always."

Ziaullah Khan,"It is very unfortunate that Master Tara Singh shepherd Sikhs into the slavery of brahmins and denied the opportunity of an independent state. The Sikhs have never been recognized by the Indian Government as a separate religious entity. In the Indian constitution, as well as in subsequent legislation, notably the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955, Sikhs have been treated as a Hindu sect. 
Cunningly Indian Government bifurcated Churhda Punjab into three states to dilute the strength of Sikhs. For ultimate subjugation, Indian Army attacked Golden Temple and Akal Takht was heavily damaged and desecrated. 
Narendra Modi has already embarked upon diverting Punjab water to other states. He wants to hit Sikhs harder than Indra Gandhi. 
Majority of Punjabi farmers own below subsistence level farmland. Financial hardship has forced them to sell their land and send children to Canada and other countries for better future. 
Narendra Modi has delivered final blow to the Sikh farmers by incorporating laws which will ultimately convert Sikh land owners into landless bonded labor.   
If this happens and at the same time Sikhs continue to sell their land to send their off springs to foreign countries, Punjab will no longer be the same Punjab. Moreover, water diversion to other states will make Punjab barren. 
If Sikhs cannot stand up and protect their identity, land, water, heritage and religion today then Punjab will slip out of their hands once for all. 
Khalistan Khalistan and Khalistan alone is the only solution to protect Sikhism and Churhda Punjab."

It is the educated population whose degree is not worth the piece of paper it is written on, but it pontificates on everything under the sun. And oh, their bleeding hearts, aren't they the epitome of empathy and kindness?! Never mind that their crocodile tears, are blurring their vision. 

Again and again, some unruly and stubborn group of people, holds the entire nation ransom to have its way and it is applauded. Selfishness in this nation, is a celebrated virtue if you belong to certain spectrums of the society which can be hijacked for political causes. All this why? because the well meaning people would rather cling to an emotional humdrum and be conveniently lazy about reading and thinking. 

India bleeds with a thousand cuts, one ill-intentioned rebellion at a time.

Thakur Partap,"the farmers protesting the farm bill are not only sikhs. In Punjab and Haryana  there are Hindu farmers , Sikh farmers Muslim farmers.  in Punjab and Haryana, the farmers are not only from from jatt caste or sikhs, there are also pundits, Brahmins , and dogar farmers in Punjab.  Farmers feed the nation.Big companies like Tata, Birla, Reliance, Ebany,  Adnany , these big companies are  controlling Modi. These bills are designed to   make  each farmer compete against each other so that big companies can buy crops at lowest rate, because farmer will have no option to sell to another buyer due to lack of logistics and lack  resources , and  the big companies have the logistics and they  will buy at lowest cost from Farmers and  export to other countries. This  will cause  food shortage in India,because big companies will  able to export the crops to more profitable buyers in other countries and the food prices will get more expensive in india. Modi is working for the  business tycoons, and big companies. The GTS is hurting the small shops, small factories, Modi needs to be removed from his throne..."

*infecting Panjabs water with carcinogenic chemicals leading to rocketing leukaemia rates
*diverting Panjabs natural resources to Rajhastan and UP, adversely affecting Panjabs agriculture
*building a dam to trap in water flowing northwards and thereby routinely flooding half of Panjab, as seen in 2019
*preventing Sikhs from practising their religion by active discrimination against Gursikhs who wear all their mandatory artefacts
*operation shudhee karan, systematic rape of sikh women 
*extortionate interest rates and very little seller protection for farmers, forcing them to take out large debts that they cannot repay, leading to mass suicide

Ramnath Narayanswamy,"After the events of Republic Day there is little sympathy for these thugs who are a combination of middlemen, rich farmers and crowds imported and paid for by vested interests. Your reporting in deeply flawed, banal and superficial and for this reason, highly  misleading. PM Modi is the best PM we have had. He has the courage to go against the tide as these path breaking laws are a 1991 moment for poor farmers and middle farmers farmers but they strike a body blow to middlemen. This is what this protest is about because it hits against corruption in Punjab and Haryana. I have not understood what these thugs want. These laws are path breaking as they free both [producers and consumers to sell in the open market if they want. You can thugs bringing in thousands of tractors from these states poor? Stocked up for six months poor?  The government has been open to talks and has dealt with them with exceptional restraint.  Rich Farmers have been treated as holy cow in this country. They rich segment benefit hugely from subsidies, pay no taxes and buy cheap from the poor cultivator and sell at huge prices in the market. This has to stop. Rich farmers need to pay taxes.  The agricultural sector has been at  the bane of benami holdings by corrupt netas and babus. PM Modi is breaking this vicious strangehold for which he deserves praise and not condemnation. By doing he would be the first PM who has actually helped those who need to be helped. The fact that there is information aysmmetry here and tthat the government has not sold the reform as strongly as they should have adds to the confusion.  This is a bold reform and it must be welcomed precisely because it is being opposed by the rich and hijacked by an opposition that does not have a head or a tail. The same applies to your Covid reporting. You fail to mention that we have handled the crisis despite our poor health infrastructure  extremely well with the lowest death rate and the highest ecvery rate in the world in contrast to the UK, France, the US and Russia and the rest of Europe who have made a mess of it.  Figures in these countries are staggering.  Your reporters and correspondents need to delve beneath appearances to reach the reality hidden within.  You do injustice to the fair name of the BBC with this stereotyped reporting.  The country cannot be held to ransom by a gang of thugs spreading misinformation and deceit."

Firstly, where does the govt get money to pay for the MSP ? The farmers, however rich he may be, does not pay taxes. So who pays the taxes to be paid to these farmers ? Mind you, the rich pays more sometimes astronomical taxes for the same facility that you and me and the farmer gets. As indeed, the farmers squeeze more money out of the system than most of us.
Secondly, the poor farmers for whom some so called communists are fighting for, produces from his 2 acres for his subsistence. So who has the maximum benefit from MSP and other subsidies and tax relief. The communists must understand that this political philosophy cannot survive unless the rich believe in it. And while doing so the country suffers.
Thirdlly, Punjab. Yes a great state in many aspects. But for the nation building or national interest - I  am sceptic. They are proud of lunger food distribution and other philanthropic activities. More internalised. Otherwise thousands of migrant workers would not have left Punjab without any visible effort by the state or community to look after them in the time of distress.
Lastly, the slogan "" Jai Jawan - Jai Kisan"" makes a nice powerful and popular slogan. Kisans are nowhere close to what a Jawan endures. Minus 40 degree celsius  this winter and look what happened to the farmers with all protection and considerable less cold. I do not believe but some sloganeers say the figure is close to 60.
The farmers are damn well responsible for providing a forum for communists and Maos and Khalistanis and many other anti national elements."
utubeableact,Very bad. Firing at our farmers is shameful
manmohan singh,"The police did not have to use, they deliberately did it. And that too , more than 500 tear gas bombs were used and few of them were even expired which becomes even more dangerous.  Consequently, fire broked out in trolley. 
Furthermore the trolley even had 2 cylinders (for their food preparations,) which could have burst but the farmers heroically took the cylinders otherwise it would have lead to massive loss of lives."

They were NOT asking for Khalistan. But the government maligned their movement like they tried to do with this one, calling them terrorists and Khalistanis and turned Hindus against Sikhs. And since there was no social media at that time, the public was successfully fooled by the government (Congress at the time). BJP is the same as Congress. Remember that in the next elections people. Vote for someone different than these two if you really want to see change. If you really want to see a true democratic India with a government that is FOR its people, and not looting its people in broad daylight. Please realize this before its too late, before India is bought by goons."

no way,"Well you just proved my point . The flag hoisted on the day was not a Khalisthani flag whatsoever . It was Nishaan Saheb flag . You can clearly differentiate between the logos on both of them . Nishaan Saheb flag can be seen atop Gurudwars . Our pm has himself worn the symbol as a head scarf . Indian army has hoisted the flags several times . 
But regardless of what flag it was , I do believe that no religious flags shoulf be hoisted on top of red fort and other buildings are totally wrong . 
Second point , the Nishaan Saheb flag was hoisted by Deep Sidhu . He had no relation with the protests until this incident . You must have heard his name .  He himself admitted"

abdullah zahid,He said in my opinion a religious symbol should not be hosited on a governement building so these peope should be arrested. Why will the police accept your decision?
ravi teja,"This hypocritical a**hole will never discuss: 
1. How many times Govt held discussions with farmers, and how at every meeting the so called farmers changed their demands
2. How Khalistani supporters entered the rally
3. If the farmers were really against the bill, why dont they go for 'crop-hold'
4. The so called farmers demanded release of vara vara rao (maoist leader) , how come that is related to the farmers??
5. Why only farmers of a particular region have protested, there was negligible protests in other parts of the country"

Nirvair Singh,Hello Guys I am a farmer from Punjab IAM telling u all that I agree some farmers became emotional and went to the red fort but BJP took  an advantage of all this and disguised there men within us . It was a very clever move of there but what good had happened. Even though it's a protest farmers have opened health camps and serving free food . Police officers have there hands tied so we cannot say a word to our cops. Nothing good has happened to either farmers nor police just BJP took benefit of it. RIP to all the people who died in farmers protest.

It is so tragic that the Govt. does not want to solve their problems.  Now just for the sake of arguement lets say  if  the Govt. rolls back the farms laws,  what is it going to cost the Govt. and what would be the effects.The Government is for the people and by the people and for the people. So if the people demand it, I dont see any reason why the Govt just cant change the laws.  The laws are made for the people and its never that people are made for laws. This is the true meaning of Democracy.  Modi Govt has no choice but to save the farmers immediately. Jai HInd!"

Janardhan Prasad D V S,.Farmers should take care to not to allow political party leaders joining the farm law protest sites. We in Andhra Pradesh have bitter experience with political party leaders in 2014. People at that time of division of the State of Andhra Pradesh agitated against the proposal. The agitation was conducted by all people. People from every nook and corner participated. Peope cooked food on streets for the participants. People wanted the andhra pradesh State to be continued to be united. News of this agitation ware not shown in other States. Only agitation for separate Telangana was shown in the local media. Arguments for united Andhra Pradesh were not shown in local TVs. And
cheema,Nice reporting by this guy
S K,"Farmers especially our elderly farmers have been out since November protesting. Modi who has been bought out by  the rich corporations of Ambani  and Adani refuses to meet with them. He has barricaded himself. In fact hes ordered the police to throw water cannons, tear gas ,  and beat them up with sticks, throw air bombs and spikes on the farmers, they are beating them up even the old, they are thrown  in jail, 200 people are missing or murdered. Women have been sexually abused. They have blamed terrorists which there were none. They have blamed Khalistan yet it has nothing to do with them. They planted their own people to create friction and create riots amongst the farmers. When I look at the pictures of the farmers I see the sad faces of the elderly and it pulls at my conscience. If you cannot understand their plight or fight  you must not be a God-fearing human being or void of a conscience. You must believe in the  right wing media in India  Aka Fox News that is owned by the government to feed lies Propaganda conspiracy theories aimed to divide and undermine the largest protest in human history. If you cannot understand then you must not believe In humanity. These farmers are just fighting for their livelihoods And no one seems to care especially in India. And because of the abuse the outside world needs to and has  to take notice. Modi needs to be exposed. What he is doing is nothing short of what Hitler did to the Jews and they tried to hide it from the rest of the world. But we are noticing and we are going to fight for the farmers and the  elders who do not have a voice right now. Many of them have committed suicide because they could not make ends meet. Im sorry a lot of Hindus think this abuse of the farmers is OK with them as its not happening to them and they will not stand up for them. They they have a country that believes in Hinduism only and want to rid India of sikhs and muslims. India is a nationalist fascist non democratic country.  I actually think being under British rule was better than what we have now. At least we were united then. If you can look at the eyes of these elderly farmers that are sitting peacefully since November And just see their pain thats all I ask and let them be heard. If you cant do that then sadly you were void of compassion and empathy"
Don Bennet Joseph,What about Bihar
Murali D,Government must not procure beyond buffer stock reccomanded from Punjab. Let punjab government buy at any rate as Farmers asking and they must store and market in thier own.
Murali D,"Government is not marketing agents for any products including agri. As other business it is his responsibilities to market. He have to Research and select which crops to farm before sewing depending on supply and demand.
APMC must be act as price control to check mate private parties indirectly by government. It must try to avoid buying maximum crop.
Government must not buy beyond buffer stock reccomanded to satisfy farmers. Government duty to govern country and pay way and guide of smooth functioning of trade. I feel what government going is correct.
Best for farmers to survive is to form FPO society and sewing and selling must be through it ,with help of educated people."

Modi is a rustic illiterate, religious fanatic to the backbone, divider-in-chief in India, riot expert, destroyer of Indian economy habitual liar, In fact BJP party is comprising of illiterates, ruffians ,goons liar & criminal of all sorts. In the effort of self glorification, Modi suo motu declared demonetization, GCT & lock-down & all proved to be dangerous in some way or other but the idiot Modi is relentless. Modi is a curse to India. Anyone with thinking ability should not vote for Modi."

PARIMAL MUKUL,"It's sad to see these illiterate farmers and their so-called ""leaders"" with vested interests protesting for something fictitious like thinking that government will stop providing MSPs to farm produce. To those who don't know a dime about the Indian Agriculture system, my advice is Google a little and gain some knowledge about the dire issues that this law intends to address. It would have been fine if farmers were protesting after the govt. has taken back the MSP support which is never gonna happen because no political party is dumb enough to lose farmers' vote which is about 70% of the working class (it's a huge number believe me) by cutting down MSPs. 

There are about 130 million farmers in India (more than the population of many big countries in the world) and certainly, not all of them are protesting because most of them will be benefited from this law."

Dipti Sharma,"These are not protestors, these are vandals. Its really interesting that only the rich farmers of Punjab have a problem with the new laws. Clearly they want to continue to monopolize the agricultural industry of India, and policies to benefit farmers across all states of India is unacceptable to them."
Punjabi Class,"The three farm bills have created fear and unrest. The farmers are fully aware of the implications these bills will have and understand the long term effect it can have on their livelihood and dignity. 

Legal rights taken away: Every Indian will be affected by this bill, the most unjust imbalance of power. The law gives immunity to all civil servants, central and state governments, or any other person in respect of anything which is in good faith done or intended to be done under this act or of any rules or orders made hereunder. So, acceptance of the bill gives immunity to civil servants against legal action for crimes they have yet to commit 'in good faith'. Indian citizens will be excluded in right to legal recourse. It is very dangerous as it erodes the rights of every citizen.

Human rights: the treatment of the peaceful protestors has turned into a Human rights violation. The BJP government has refused to grant repeal to the laws. They are simply outlining their usefulness. Article 19 of Indian constitution states freedom of speech and expression. 

Dignity of farmers: farmers should be recognised by who they are and not what they give. Farmers can be dying to get out of contract arrangements where they're not given concrete leverage and can be left with little energy to diversify their production.

Capitalist: contract farming is capital accumulation and exploitation of the farming society. Contractors keep prices low to maximise profits. 1998 deregulated Indian sugar industry did not improve farmers' income. Pursuit of profit drives corporates more than notion of public interest or democracy. 

Contract farming: this should not be the only option. Contract companies are monoculture, reluctant to re-invest back into farming communities' rural interests. Sub-standard commodities can be rejected. Payments to farmers can be delayed. 

Food: food will be exported pushing locals to rely on imports. Natural seeds will be lost to manufactured products. Storage of crop will result in driving food prices up or down, at the mercy of the stakeholders. 

Legal contracts: contracts will be lengthy, costly litigation involved, lands will be leased long term and binding contracts will be difficult to exit. Agreements are designed so they do not allow farmers to break out of poverty cycle. 

Infrastructure: deregulated sugar industry did not improve infrastructure. Roads at risk of destruction by haulage trucks from urban areas.

Environment: soils can be degraded, chemicals and excessive use of fertilisers all have negative footprint in a market driven crop. 

MSP: the new bills clearly state that MSP is not part of law. 

Recommended resolution: Empowering farmers to lead by experimentation, build consensus and make choices rather than embracing contract farming as the only option. Farmers can yield trust-worthy results by understanding problems from all prospectives. Explore broader ranges and allow leads to more innovative solutions that address underlying factors."
Punjabi Class,"Delhi Parliament itself needs reforming and modernisation. Passing of the 3 farmers bills is testimony of failures in following the rule books of Parliament. A handful of people decided the fate of millions without debates and consultations. A bill that is passed under controversial circumstances should not become law.

On 20 September 2020, in Parliament the rule book was ignored by the chairman.

1. The rule book says that if a voice vote is challenged by any member, the chairman must ask for a division. Under no circumstances must a chairman ignore this demand. The chairman ignored this demand. 

2. Audio and broadcasting was censored in parliament when division was demanded by opposition so the public could not see it.

3. BJP did not have enough numbers to pass the bill so it rushed it in an undemocratic way.

4. Voice vote is only chosen where 70 percent of members support a bill. This bill did not meet that criteria so voice vote does not apply. However, the chairman decided to go ahead with voice vote and for his ears, it was a yes. Voice vote is not recorded so it's open to controversy.

5. When members stood from their seats, the rule book says that Parliament should have been adjourned. The chairman did not adjourn the parliament. He rushed the bill through instead.

6. Opposition requested the bills to be put forward to a select committee. The chairman denied them that opportunity, again against the rule book.

7. Not enough time was given for the bill to run in Gujrat as a trial. Gujratis have not openly praised the bills.

8. BJP refused to have a debate on the bills. They rushed them through.

9. There are 4 ways of voting: voice vote, counting vote, voting recorder or votes by lobbying. The weakest voting method is voice vote. There is no permanent record in voting this way. This bill was rushed through voice votes. This should not have happened. It is the weakness of the chairman and this bill was too important to be treated this way.

10. Eight MP's were suspended from Parliament that day. This left the house empty. 15 bills were passed through parliament in the absence of these suspended MP's because the opposition was eliminated.

This is not democracy. It is no where near democracy. The PM has a lot to answer for."
Hardik Doshi,"I feel that this agriculture reformed bill proposed by Gov. needs some changes & amendments to ENSURE that our most diligent & hardworking farmer brothers get their truly deserving  rewards:

1) Need to define the Regulated framework where Government will oversee & monitor the Contract farming deal presented by Private Entity.

2) Government need to formulate the law & create the framework which ENSURES that farmer should be funded with the promised amount as per the contract.

3) If any Private company tries to BACKOUT from the promised price then need to frame laws to suspend their functioning license. Such that way strict laws will PROTECT our hardworking farmer community.

Farmers WERE, ARE & WILL BE the foundational & core asset of Indian Economy. So need to focus on empowering  & prospering our farming community to see the strong economy & growth of India  on the global platform.

After a month he joined punjab and haryana  kisan Mocha. At that time
Punjab and haryana  leader should 
not entertain him .They allowed  him
and Rakesh hijacked  this andolan in his favour and took heavy  money
from Congress,  Samajbadi  party,
APP party and TMC and left and took the media coverage. Now Punjab and Hariyana  Farmer leaders
should beat him and throw him out
of Gajipur Border. Rakesh Tikayat 
has taken thirty crores from

Amit Shah, Narendar Modi, Ambani and Adani are part of the American mafia to reduce world population so that a small number of Americans and other elites from other parts of the world can have the whole Earth for themselves and not 8 to 10 billion people. These people believe that populations have to be reduced so that the Americans elite can continue to dominate Earth for thousand of years to come. They fear the Indian population will take over the world as the largest community. Both Modi, Amit Shah, Adani and Ambani are part of this grand plan.  Covid 19 is part of this plan. Ask Narendar Modi and Amit Shah to give their lives to save India. Bhindranwale fought and died to stop Indira Gandhi from selling over not only Punjab but the whole of Bharat Ma to the KGB. Most pro-BJP Indian politicians are traitors to India. Sikh have always been saviours to the Indian cause. First fighting against Moghuls, British, Chinese, Pakistanis and all terrorist elements. Sikhs has sacrified highest number of lives for the cause of India. Any bastardic leader from BJP or any other party who talks of Hindutva is a traitor. If not for Sikhs, Gurus of Sikhs, Maharaja Ranjit Singh and even Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale who made North Indian Hindu communities realise that the Sikhs can be downtrodden, India would never be a united and sovereign nation. It is Narendar Modi, Amit Shah who are destroying the fabrics of unity of Secular India. Jai Hind. Jai Bharath Ma. Jai Kissan, Jai Mazdoor Jai Jawan, JAI HINDUSTAN."

Gambhir singh Lamba,"All these are happening because of corrupt infrastructure that had been made by corrupt politicians ,why constitution acts were not made on right to equality bases ,why special privelages was been given in constitution act like reservation of backward class ,St class ,minority commission ,sachhar commission .All these deformities  has given rise to corrupt politicians ,corrupt flow of election  etc ,due to all these factor democracy is declining ,future is not bright for democracy if it is not corrected today ,other factor is over population that causing unemployment ,why laws were made on religious bases ,why laws wrere not made on one law one nation bases ,today literacy rate is increasing and frequent more andolens of right and wrong people could be seen in near future and the reason is errors in the constitution act made by corrupt politicians ,why the constitution we're not made on fundamental bases that cannot get changed by any politicians ,there should be no power to any politicians to give special privelages to any religion ,caste or tribe as we will see more conflict on these issues in near future as the govt will become helpless to give employment to all citizen due to over population ,if we see who are responsible for the cause of over population then we will examine that Muslims and backward class are the main cause and the govt had given them special privelages in the name of reservation ,now unemployment is increasing on every class so situations will become more worse day by day .Corruption has now touching the top and in my opinion the task has become too difficult for every govt unless and until a govt do not take very strong action on all these issues without seeing their own future within their 5 years period , one emergency is more required to correct the deformities for good purpose ,and every Indian should see its result in a positive way , I don't know who will do this revolution only a courageous and honest can do this in my opinion"

Every night, they are sanitizing the protest sites, following covid protocols as much as possible. The thing to understand is that they are fighting for their lives too. The govt. is adamant and egoistic that it is keeping the farmers like this. With just one decision of the govt. hundreds of lives could have been saved by now, and also, all that these people have gone through from past many months. The union leaders have been continuously spreading awareness about Covid, preparing for the worst situations. And all you point out is that Farmers think Covid doesn't exist."
abhimanyu singh,If there is no corona then  these people/ fake farmers should be send to covid patient wards without mask and hand gloves. It is height of nonsenses.

At farmer end, problem of seed selection, or credit availability or using ICT for connecting with experts is there and it is explained quite well in this. Further from marketing end, https://youtu.be/qb7x84PS4mk this video will help take some initiatives. In my opinion, small landholding is also one of major cause of farmers, as it restricts economics of scale. May we some co-operatives (like in lines of Dairy cooperatives ) can be formed in future."

madhu kolli,"The agri reforms are right in this direction to enhance farmers income through FPO. Educated people can set up FPO, they can educate farmer on latest techniques and trends and buy the produce at farm , grade  ,pack, transport  to any where in Indian markets or whole sales and can sell  produce at a profitable rate.Why not a give a fair trail to these agri  reforms.Some companies can also take up this ,the reform will pave the players enter the market which will add value and enhance farmers income Same people opposed reforms in Telephones.

Like organic fertilizer , pesticides  , supply of water , sapling  should have received in low prices . I am not telling to give subsidies this will result in ultimate loss. There should be infrastructure from nearest river so that we can allocate water at low lost in my land . Many other processes can be devised"
Anshul Mittal,Great great explanation !!!
raghu ramireddy,Clear explanation. Thank you madam.
Raghav Mehta,"Nowdays u r making more videos, which is so humiliating for study iq"

You started with how to double the farmer income and end with all type of processing and other things.  But I would like to ask that, processing units established in India in well condition and I can show you many processing unit Now came to shut down due to some loss, so I think it may be not a region to down the rate, second thing is lack of good storage facility, I accept it, it's major problem in India and should be solved. In your early time you told that the input supply for farmers should be low, but when it happens ultimately price may come again down but govt should take care of msp in this time. And very important online networking for vegetable market in all over India should be more.....

lololee,"future since like kargil fund , the govt will pronounce to  save agriculture save indian industries to bring new slap rate to add on taxing busines , because india best taxing  state vs central well versed in making"
lololee,"kindly use the term in english when u taking it for presentation  so tht presenting in hindi with some literal basic things to be expressed with word english

more so ever , more people who pay taxes get affected the probelm for public or private players but the consumer get affected
and the day so much near by already govt started digging every life now and then 

now state and ceneral charging gst taxes when each individual usage of vegetable or fruit purchase will be the future tax for 

state will exercise near future to earn through different form of tax they will act as more middlemen looters
state will exercise like following tax drainage , garbage taxes , now vegetable taxe  that will exercise near future 
so that they will come out fooling public that 
so in order to save farmers and the busienss system govt needs money to run and give support and  invest more money 

then after agriculture tax to normal consumer 
later industry taxes raw material procurement to making finished goods trader middlemen then 

agri tax , industri tax is the existing future in future budget expected in any state 
we used to buy industry products from indian make underline that 
industry tax, agri tax for any individual when he starts earning salary 
that wil near future to bring state budget system though they are not preparing it will be future and expected system adding on corruption taxes 

this will only and every farmer market will sell as much the same , middlemen will do the same trader subsequently same thing corporates will play near future as any role under them 
what about buyer as consumer - he has to exercise by pledging and pay agri tax for india solil grown vegetable and fruit , and then industry product produced and made as finsished goods 

when a state in remote ends , no suburban metro districts develeopment they will engage to fool public  

how long trauma will be carried"

AJEET SINGH RAISAR,"Thank you so much to the public, voice India, for giving correct and accurate news of nokha from my side, and I would like to request them to keep this channel in the same way so that we have news of the whole nokha in which we can find thanks"

For Aliana Chawla,"And the main problem is not the act or law; the problem is that the judiciary of India is so poor that you would have Indian law saying for instance ""making obscene videos is a crime or encouraging a movie porn maker is a crime in itself."" But, these people are celebrated on news channel every moment & are not penalised as per the law. 

So, bringing a law giving farmer right prices enabling them to enjoy their due share saying that farmers right will be protected after the legal agreement with the other party. 

I don't believe that it is possible, the reason is that the celeberated corrupt enjoys great power & half of the masses don't know that they are corrupt and address them as 'Saabs' & fear them as they are influential. 

Because criminals in suits or proper kurta pyjama in farming & other sectors enjoys good influence in the society and are a reason of crime done on many. 

It is first hard for a non-influential farmer to file his complaint. Even if he does, it is not easy to get justice along with that he has to face violence & threat if he is challenging a person who is extremely powerful because of his influence on other people. 

So, bringing law or amendments do not serve the purpose in any sector including farming till the respected influential criminal on tv & in the society are not referred as what they are in the society. 

So, that a criminal leader do not create people from the youth his fans on the basis of fake persona & slowly manipulates them to be extremely violent on the masses. Thus, it is better to say them what they are rather than calling them as 'Saabs' & giving the respected criminals acceptance."

Flamin Mongrel,Monoply of corporate will still be more diverse than the monoply of the government.
Flamin Mongrel,Punjab and Haryana want the monoply to continue so they can keep getting the money whilst the rest of the farmers die.
timestuber,Farm laws are indeed a Big GOOD thing for farmers.  Surprisingly the well-to-do farmers in Punjab and Haryana want STATUS-QUO to continue.  Farmers from other states do see a HUGE benefit from farm laws!  The left elements and opposition have been very good at enhancing the confusion.  Since this issue is happening in the mid-term it is not going to influence 2024 elections.  Unnecessarily they are robbing the farmers from escalating to NEW HEIGHTS in the field of Agriculture.
Kalavati Meisheri,"Instead of stopping new farm bill for 18 months let farmers experience new farm bill for 18 months and side by side committee form bring any amendment if needed on the experience of farmers then farmers will release that new farm bill is in there favours .let kotak securities kotak bank open 3 in 1 account of farmers i.e demat, trading, bank account, also teach farmers how to export  agro products of export quality skill development under kotak bank global trade account for exporters small marginal big farmers all over India .farmers will have 2nd line of income support .while getting benefit of 2nd line of income they can provide food grains of good quality"

Why don't you highlight what the condition of the farmers were during the time of the Congress government? And also please tell me the who the farmers you actually spoke to."
Siddarth RV,Comments are about the lady. Only anti national views
Ani 777,"1) If all farmers are against this bill means they will not sell there produce to private mandis , then how can these private mandi can exploit them.
2) This law increases competition among artiyas and private firms , if private firms offer higher prices of crops then it will forces artiyas to increase there prices also."

Listen to P. Sainath on youtube.. He says Farm Bill is the corporate hijack of India and it Will Create Utter Chaos, and this is a fight for India , not just for farmers. ' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAQ-l2U4sAg"
S T,Well explained. This is a corporate sell out.
Kitturu Rani Chennamma,so the conclusion of your report is mandi owners are in loss not farmers
amit kulkarni,"Thanks for sharing the details. In the solution, you mentioned as Govt  has assured getting MSP. 

we are border districts ok karanrata due to mandi system. we cant sell our group to another state where the price is much higher. 
another problem is if all farmers start growing only one crop that has the highest MSP then when will happen to FCI. because most mos the farmer is going single corp then water consumption is more. 

Most of the mandi under control of local politician we are getting a better price.:( I feel current laws new law is better than existing law"
Jeevnesh Kaushik.,"i got fan the way you speak.....its was nicely explained by you  maam, especially it sound logical to me...........and at last i want to say that it improved my level of understanding the issue, thanks!!!!!!"
najmus sayadat,"The word ' middleman ' is Being criminalized throughout decade. Every educated nuts like us and also our policymakers Don't know what crucial role a middleman plays in supply chain and how deeply and logically farmers are dependent on them. They are not just money grabbers what most of us think. The price gap of a product between Farm gate and retail price is not just middleman's profit. Most of it is the cost of providing services and wastage of produce throughout the process because of inefficient supply chain.

Lots of respect to you guys.first time I Have  watched a content on this issue that shows the real  Groundwork behind it."
ankur mishra,"There is one point which u have mentioned wrong... If there is surplus of crop the price will go down and buyer would take benifit. 
This is incorrect the law says about fall and rise in price. 
Even If price goes down in market buyer has to pay as per the set contract price. 
In fact if the price goes up then farmers can again negotiate with buyer that he wish to sell as per market price and buyers has to oblige. 

Other points were explained pretty well. 
I would also share one view.. It's government's duty to take care of APMC, like u mentioned salary, roads, maintenance etc. If they don't get tax from farmers they would still be functional from government. They have a budget for all this. 
It'll like in corona trains are not running so railways employees won't get salary or how maintenance would happen how new tracks would be laid out. 
Answer is everything would function."
sanvi agrawal,they have helped me understand it way better than the 2 months of waching news channels

And on the other hand we have to find actual news on YouTube."
Nikita,I would consider this News channel to be saying absolute truth with unbiased opinion and information. But you forgot to mention the role of the Private players as the hidden controllers of the government- The Ambanis and Adanis
Gur Sahi,"seriously.... jaha jyada paisa milega waha bechega..... modi is still thinks he is not pm of india but he campaigner of chaddi gang.......

best mandis of india is in Delhi (Parliament) and state legislatures.... where junk is sold and purchased...............

let farmers sell their produces in best mandis as above........."
Lks1789,"Now farmers have negotiating power in Mandis ?.  We have seen farmers throwing on roads when the price of tomato crashed to less than a rupee at Mandis.  They could not even recover transportation cost, where was negotiating power.  Now the mandi cartel decides what rate.  If existing system is so good or just good, why are farmers committing suicide.... Oppose for the sake of opposing or opposing is itself an opportunity to make money..."

ykm_online,"another solution by an IAS teacher and PhD Dr , watch this one 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcqVWFZXyaE&t=7965s"
ykm_online,listen to this one - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jJh-ahCQx0 to know the history about MSP and what Congress did under Manmohan Singh and Swaminathan committee recommendations.
ykm_online,"BJP and Congress both have expressed the issues with 'APMC' mandi having lots of issues. Kerala n many other states do not use the Mandi. Rice grower of Kerala are not protesting. The projected roles of Adatiya being glorified by this lady. Why is this protest , since the large growers of wheat do not know the tax payer money of 33000 crores , which was coming to the states, what will happen ? Govt has been buying the wheat , its reaching the PDS shops via APMC and not that all the goods sold is class 'A'. In fact the PDS ration shop wheat is not palatable by a common man.  This means a good grower of wheat lets say 100 quintals , in reality is selling 200 quintals in APMC ( out of which 100 is stones and not real wheat ). Then the money related to this wheat , goes to middlemen and farmers.  Ashirvad atta company or similar ones do not buy this wheat.  When farmer dumps his wheat in APMC mandi , who finally buys it from there and where does the wheat gets utilised , has the real answers for this protest.  Why does Govt still imports despite bumper crop ( or farmer does not export ) , if he has done excellent quality and has a fear of the price drop. ??? Few questions are based on fears. These are away from reality...On ground , the news channel should visit APMC ware houses and show the pictures of rats and rotten wheat laying , lack of disposal in time and usage. That will clear all the muck. The channels are not spending time to show real ware house conditions."
Lokh D Vyaas,"thanks for the initiative, this really helpful.."
Shubham Singh,"Well done as an anchor but does not has any idea of ground reality.
   5:49 ""farmers corrected us by telling that adhati is not an exploitative entity""  really!!  I mean really!!    May be she was told so by ""protesting farmers"" (or should i say "" protesting adhati"" which are going loose their monopoly by these farm laws, or they will have to compete (put efforts) to stay in market, because market is all about efficiency.)
      I wish people had more common sense. Voting for the vary same corrupt polititions (caste/class preferences) and believing in exploitative adhati and reactionists politition is not good. MSP is not going anywhere. Like in every case where situation demands the government stands with its people (whether RCEP,  PANDEMIC (Govt. was paying salary, medical services, welfare paments, subsidies etc even though economy was at a standstill) , it is the govt who is providing subsidies, 6000 rs. at the first place for welfare of its people, or any other situation) , so will be in this case. 
      The future is free (and regulated) market."
Shubham Singh,"10:07 that mean i should not say a 'rotten banana',""rotten banana"" ;because it might hurt its sentiments."
Kush Jindal,4:55 that's the benefit of contract farming rate is fixed no matter if price falls company have to buy on that price
serinder singh,"Can you trust this man with white beard?  He has sold India down the river eg railway etc,  he looted public of 500 rupees , did not bring back  ill gotten monies (black money) and the list goes on."
serinder singh,Can you trust this fat boy?
No One,"Farmers in the Other Parts of India don't have a single problem and why do these punjab farmers have a problem? Congress the opposition government is creating chaos in India against BJP and Narendra Modi. And the Farmers of the Rest of the India came to protest against these farmers protesting for no reason. Making innocent faces won't  make you great and develop stympathy for these fake farmers in no smart person's heart. These are Khalistani people and kisan andolan is just a name but they are the Khalistani supporters. These people protested with the Khalistani flag in USA also at the same time and they said it was all linked and planned.

And why would any farmer stay antil their need in their farms? Why will they remain wasting their time in protests during their Sowing and Harvesting season. No farmers who would actually be suffering would wait for so long for any purpose during their Sowing and Harvesting season. Starting from 9th August and continued for 7 months and 2 days. Can any farmer stay for so long. No they can't. Then who are these? They are the fake farmers or Not an Indian. Because no Indian would create Chaos on the Republic Day of his/her country India!

""Jai Jawan Jai Kisan"" is a slogan famous in India. Now will any True Indian and a True Kisan (farmer) create a chaos on the Red Fort in India that too on an important day for India which is it's Republic Day. These fake farmers on that day beated the police, destroyed the government things and harmed at the Red Fort. Why is this not highlighted. Why is it not highlighted that how come only Farmers from Punjab have issues with the new law introduced?????
This is all dirty plans of Congress."
No One,"Yes, why only Punjabi farmers have a problem with the laws and NOT THE OTHER FARMERS ALL OVER THE INDIA?? Are only Punjabi's a farmers in India? Why no one stressing on how the created a chaos and beat police. Why no one stressing upon the fact that the other farmers of India protested against these punjabi farmers and Said that if the other farmers of India have no problem with this then why there is a problem with only these?? This is too much of partiality. Congress purposely doing these bad games."
MARC MACLELLAN,Thanks protect the small farmers ..why not tax the super rich or eat the super rich
Ramen Naidoo,"Every reporter has a different way of explaining the laws, yet in all history, the farmers are stinking rich by using small farmers to produce for them. What about that?"
Sourabh Chugh,Very well explained!!..thumbs up
prashant raj,What is arti that you are referring many times?
Abhishek Kashyap,Logic itself is flawed as they went to farmers protest to gain insights about govt vs farmer . It would make more sense to also go to non protestors and understand why these laws will work . technically sample space is skewed
Lalit Kumar,Some negative dimensions of creating the Difficulties in the short term but it's the reality that these provisions can improved our farmers in the long term
Prem Kumar,Has the government banned Mandi system? No. Then why can't the protesting farmers continue the old system. Let both prevail.

Sridhar Krishnan,"Stupid to say in one word decently. A reform recommended by various committees, demanded at various times by these very same farm associations & finding mention in political parties' manifestos suddenly becomes contentious? If ""farmers"" are worried about their mandis & 'middlemen' fading out, what prevents them from contributing the taxes saved to them? It's quite strange that 'humble service providers' suddenly become ""life saviors"" & ""family lenders""!! Where do they get all the monies when they are worried about their livelihood being lost due to these reform laws?? Nothing of your blabber makes any sense. What is very visible is your mad rage to oppose whatever the Govt does. Considering this reform has potential to increase contribution of farming sector to GDP by two fold, and, that we have no other arsenal in our efforts to boost economy this significantly, any opposition to this reform must be construed as criminal & those who are fantasizing that this Govt can be brought down by developing a perception of general disenchantment, would even sell the country if it can fulfill their dreams.  While you have no compulsion to become a good citizen, just reflect on yourself as to why are you doing this great harm to a poor country whose poor people are desperately looking for meeting their basic needs & live a dignified life? It should hurt your conscience if you have one."

Goutham Shiny,"Middle men providing loans to farmers sounds silly defence to deny a bill.
The number of middle men losing their job with such a bill is not comparable to the amount of difference this act brings to number of farmers across the country.
If you want to make new policies for the general good of the country and dont want to compromise on few jobs that are inevitable to be removed eventually, u r never going to pass any bills in any country with such a pessimistic non gutsy approach.
The people commenting here are so into the girl, praising her skills of explanation and voice rather than judging the content of the speech."

Wisephoton,I'm in the UK and interested in what is going on with the farmers.

Soma Shekar,"Dear reporter, It is a good presentation. But couple of doubts.
1.Why APMC is not perfect system and what are the complaints.
2. They worry is about sale of surplus production of crop, why can't they go to another buyer. They can even go to APMC at MSP price.
3. They are worrying about Adthi funding. How about banks?
4. They think they are weaker in negotiation positions, if that is the case then why can't they do collective selling so that many farmers will negotiate and sell it. Then they will have a higher hand. They themselves will come for selling in any areas.
5. They think if Adthi will not lend money if they are side out by the companies, but their primary business is lending, still can lend the money for the marriages or any health issues by depositing their documents to them as usual.
6. The Adthi can also become a private company. They will buy the crop from the farmers.
7. What is the difference between Adthi and a private company apart from personal relations.
8. Why always big companies will come for buying, why can't small companies and Adthi's can come for buying.

can you help me to understand this madam."
Harnoor Singh,Extremely well  explained
Priya Sridhar,It is the job of the Delhi police and gov to verify credibility of protestors and there profession as if which a wrong intention innocent Delhites peace wellness and cannot be at risk
Priya Sridhar,Was it verified if the actual profession of each protestor was farming only by the Delhi police
Priya Sridhar,Farmers are always nature lovers and peaceful people they are strong enough to discuss why will they protest then especially when 80 percentage of India is farmers
G-Force,Why then are farmers in Punjab growing rice because of subsidized power and water. That system needs reform badly.

H S,Why does the PM sound like an kindergarten teacher - ummm...The bottom line is the farmers dont trust the govts intent.
Biswa Ranjan Dash,"The government would have anyway passed the laws bcoz they have a clear majority. Laws are Constitutional and you can't question that. You seem more concerned about the people of APMCs than farmers. Yes some ammendments are necessary as you said about the settlement of disputes but you can't reject the laws by putting your narrative .
Laws will favour the farmers only if you let them come out of traditional ways of growing and selling crops"

Paramodharmah,"Newslaundry doesn't tell you that private players have to pay tax to govt in contract farming! Therefore, the tax that was supposed to be coming from Mandi will be coming from Private players! And here the farmer doesn't even have to pay tax! Jaago Bharat Jaago!
Edit 1:
Why are they lying? If arhtiyas lose their job and in turn people employed by them, according to them the private players will use them as labourers or workers; this will turn a Kisan-Arhtiya Person-Person deal to Kisan-Company Person-Company deal, which will make it difficult for Kisan to negotiate. But why aren't they telling the fact that the law mentions that Kisan can emd the contract anytime in between and has no provision like that of Punjab that they'll be jailed. The laws protect the Kisan.
Edit 2:
They talk about how Arhtiyas give money to Kisan purely based on trust to bail them out. And they won't tell you, again, that the interest will be higher than that of a Bank. Please don't spread a one sided narrative.
Edit 3:
NL says that as SDM will resolve dispute in contract farming and not civil court, and that they are corrupt so they fear losing the fight, but why won't you tell the people that constitutional courts are always open?
Edit 4:
Why can't an ordinance take place? What's wrong in it? If they had an issue with it, why did they not debate it during the duration which was meant for debate? Why say they bulldozed it? Just because you hate Modiji?
Edit 5:
They ask how can govt call laws pro farmers? Read it and you'll understand 
Edit 6:
What do you even mean? Only 50k ""people claiming to farmers"" Don't represent the farmers of the country. No one saying all are being mislead. Some have been mislead, some are doing it purposely, and some are not even farmers but still going there to sit for fun!"

For Aliana Chawla,"And the main problem is not the act or law; the problem is that the judiciary of India is so poor that you would have Indian law saying for instance ""making obscene videos is a crime or encouraging a movie porn maker is a crime in itself."" But, these people are celebrated on news channel every moment & are not penalised as per the law. 

So, bringing a law giving farmer right prices enabling them to enjoy their due share saying that farmers right will be protected after the legal agreement with the other party. 

I don't believe that it is possible, the reason is that the celeberated corrupt enjoys great power & half of the masses don't know that they are corrupt and address them as 'Saabs' & fear them as they are influential. 

Because criminals in suits or proper kurta pyjama in farming & other sectors enjoys good influence in the society and are a reason of crime done on many. 

It is first hard for a non-influential farmer to file his complaint. Even if he does, it is not easy to get justice along with that he has to face violence & threat if he is challenging a person who is extremely powerful because of his influence on other people. 

So, bringing law or amendments do not serve the purpose in any sector including farming till the respected influential criminal on tv & in the society are not referred as what they are in the society. 

So, that a criminal leader do not create people from the youth his fans on the basis of fake persona & slowly manipulates them to be extremely violent on the masses. Thus, it is better to say them what they are rather than calling them as 'Saabs' & giving the respected criminals acceptance."

Sen Thamizhan,Why doesn't the government first does the experiment in Gujarat and UP - and show the results before implementing across India?
Safiulla Khan,Bottom line is one word adhani farms .....shame
Uma Prasanna,"these are communists 
internet dont hear to them"
Traveller Life,"Basis thing is before an important law is passed  it must be discussed in parliament .  Otherwise what is the use of electing MP and sent from various states. Also state related rights cannot be taken and central laws cannot be forced.   Why FCI do not have money ? How much crores of Rs is wasted through demonitization    ,  if govt  had   .0001 % of wasted money through GDP loss  it could have been used well for the farmers.  No one ask that question ?  Modi govt 's failures cannot be forced on farmer."
Mandar K,My father is farmer in Maharashtra. I am selling my grains below MSP in APMC from last 20 years. We don't have any option to sell other than Mandi. New farm Laws will give me more options for better price. Farm laws will help all the  farmers over India except Panjab and Haryana. That's why only they are opposing and not rest of India. But you can not decide farmers fate based on 2 states...
m kalimuthu,Love from Tamil Nadu We stand with the farmers. And you should also know about the protest by Tamil farmers a few years back in Delhi.
Rahul Bhandari,Robust mechanism. Lol
hometypist1966,"Dispute Resolution you mean like TRAI who caters to only the Mobile Companies.  Such Dispute Resolutions Authority are always in favour of the Corporates and ultimately the farmers will be running from pillars to pillars, so such Experts who say that such mechanism should be there is talking over the head without knowing abcs of dispute mechanism in India.  Yes, the 1st Expert was clearly biased towards the BJP Govt but he thinks those who are listening to this are fools and thus brought the Dispute Mechanism issue which is a complete failure in various other Sectors, just take the case of TRAI"
Harpreet Kaur,The laws of India by book are the best. The problem is implementing them and the reality is far from what it comes across as.
Abhi Raj Singh,Discussions should be done before passing a law not after
Anshika Singh,"Then ""Parliament""- made for discussions and debates. 
Now ""Parliament""-FUCKING place of dictatorship and discussions take place on internet that to not initiated by the gov."
Kokuyo Camlin,"These bills are good and meant to make farmers more entrepreneurial. The only problem which i found was Top to down approach of implementation. Govt should have done more ground. If one dig out, they will get many papers during Congress Govt which also recommended abolition of APMC, these mandis have monopolistic behaviour, that's why Farmers get Rs 2/ dozen and consumer purchasing 20x times of that. Reason why Farmers never grew, never had investment capabilities for mordern equipments. I hope Modi govt wouldn't back off. I don't support CAA all the nonsense of bhakts but this act is like 90s LPG reforms."
Doc Csquare,First speaker was clearly biased towards govt... One point being repeatedly raised is right now not much procurement is happening at msp prices.. Is this a sound argument? Why not improve it? Dont take us granted for..we are not idiots
game tech,Man why always English u shld speak in Hindi there r many ppl who can't understand eng
HIMANSHU SHARMA,Firstly farmer across north india not protesting becoz I come from varanasi were big farmers dont even go to mandi becoz there is no MSP even big farmer dont know what is msp so this is wrong to say all over north india doing it we dont care we sell it to local vendor and we are going to do that
Hamza,"This is an issue of economics and politics should not be mingled with it.
I'm from Punjab Pakistan and really feel for the farmers in both countries as their socio-economic hasn't really improved in past years in both the countries.
We boast ourselves as agricultural countries but our farmers' situation suggests we need to reform the agricultural sectors in our countries heavily."
Roopkaran Singh,Whats hone wrobg with QUINT...very below avergae discussion n the professionals too...their knowledge seems to be only have bookish knowledge...if you go through the mjor channels n columnists they had supported this ..now they are backing off...so bringing inn the big wigs will not work...few questions....when everything can be changed n made new law..why cnt MSP is not added...when we talk about other states...then pls read how much they got for their wheat..bihar sold it for 700 rs...n govt of india decided for 1980...so of open mkt is successful then why in bihar its failed...apart from this farmers cannot go to the court of law ..actually this is the is best system across the world and govt should replicate this across india..but they have chosen to kill this too great...so if you cnt beat the benchmark....kill the benchmarking itself
Pratinav P,I totally think these farm laws are progressive and the farmer must be educated about the actual true essence of the bills instead of being fed misinterpreted arguments on these bills. Jai jawan jai Kisan
Kushagra Namdev,So these biased people decide is farmer bill good or bad
AMRITPAL SINGH,These.  Expect. Shouldnt have tell.  Thats tell open markets has open In america too.  Ask American farmers. What happend to    American agriculture.   Finished. This is failed.  Systems
Shamimul Hai,BJP government has screwed the economy of India  ...due to that they are selling everything one by one...to cover their Shit ???
Johnson Mathew,"One argument most of them who support the new law saying that, now also many sell outside the mandy and where is the big difference. But they do not answer  why this new law at all in the first place."
Arrie,"In July this year the buffer stock held by FCI was 97 million metric tonnes against the required 41 million metric tons. So we actually have a very high wheat production in the country which is not required. Farmers should get creative and grow crops that are in demand in India or the international market. 
'But why bother? Wheat is a safe bet. We will grow and the government has to buy with MSP'- that is the mentality of the farmers."
Sanj Z,"Why do they require sponser for this bill them? Why not allow msp clause in the law? Why are you restricting the crops and what seeds to be used in farming? People are not illiterates to see that these laws have always been manipulated for benefitting corporate sector for easy procurement and monopolistic practices. Why do you have to avoid mandi then? Govt can deal directly with farmers to give them msp agreement and be done with it. The questions are not even that, why not give the best option to farmers than restricting them by law to cultivate what the corporate masters of this govt tells."
Toruk Makto,So basically these farm bill are actually beneficial for the farmers from majority of the states!!
madhav wadhawan,A very good initiative
Harshith Sadhana,"every industry like mining, autoindustry, textiles,schools, colleges etc.  in this world is exploited.  when the industry begins there is barely profit because people are doing for talent, passion, helping the community. later 10-15 the industry grows  exponentially. after 20 years the industry is fully exploited and has bad name forever."
Sunpreet Tiwana,"Not mentioned point no provision for court, moreover in yesterday meeting with farmers , government has agreed with farmers that there are flaws in the bills  and asking if they want amendments, but farmers want to repel these laws . Sooner or later govt is accepting its mistakes in the bill ."
Jay Pandya1,"Then what is the final solution to the problem of the farmers? Congress constantly days that BJP is not giving final solution, then kindly explain what they have been doing for 70 goddamn years"
Ishan Gyan,"Quint please do a panel discussion, in which only experts are their, this is a complex issue making a decision is very hard"
Brice Noronha,"To be honest Even if these laws are beneficial to farmers, then the farmers cannot be blamed for it because this govt is always in a rush to pass laws without having a proper discussion or feedback from the beneficiaries and to make matters worse they have been taking advantage of this  situation to pass laws behind closed doors to avoid any public discussions."
Mansoor M,"Still discussing about farm bills is a Shitty thing,when 2 CM's of bjp say they won't let farmers of other states to sell Thier crops ,then how can PM can say they can sell any where, don't the CM's give respect to him or he doesn't matter to them.."
Harsimran Singh,"The whole country should have APMC mandis, Punjab and Haryana has the best system in whole World. Even UP and Bihari and Rajasthan farmers come to Punjab and Haryana to sell their produce, Why ? Bcoz of Better pricing. Private cronies only loot from poor."
Mr. A,"The Indian farmer is not at all competitive due to the massive subsidy provided by the governments free electricity, free water, subsidised insecticides, pesticides and fertilizers and with msp the farmers are just getting no competition imagine if india signed rcep or any other trade deal most would perish but we are living in a capitalist world time has come for our farmers to start getting competitive."

Max,Norma single question about masks and social distancing. I wonder if Samdish n co were afraid or just biased
Coding Essential,"what many people dont understand: 1. central govt doesn't have budgetary resources to buy entire product of all farmers around India, that is why they don't want to make it a law otherwise they will be bound to buy everything. economically and fiscally, this is impossible. 2. APMC mandis are strongly cartelised meaning only few people can buy from there becoz getting license is very difficult and costs a lot (>5lacs) so these traders buy produce at low prices eventually hurting farmers. also small farmers don't have money to take their produce by tractor to mandi, pay taxes and storage cost till produce is sold. by legitimising outside mandi sale, this will help them legally sell outside mandi. farm laws have been in implementation in m'rashtra for over a decade and now and mandis are still intact. 3. conflict resolution problem is genuine (this is something that govt should consider) 4. repeal of essential commodities act will benefit traders who will now want to buy produce to sell at higher price without govt intervention. even if we imagine that this will lead to steep prices, will it not lead to many people beginning to trade to sell at ""slightly lower price than competition to be at a profit""? this will ultimately ensure correct prices (this basically is the essence of market economics , i.e, to promote efficiency through competition and self interest."
Kunal Dhruw,After knowing you are anti BJP we don't expect you are true reporting you are just biased

If this protest was to defend farmers, then why is that only the wealthiest farmers are fighting against this? Its like Amazon saying socialism or communism is bad for the country. The highest farmer suicide rate is in Maharashtra and Bihar, not Punjab. Whole India supports this bill except for Punjab. We all know what Greta Thunberg tweeted along with the toolkit explaining exactly what Rihanna has to tweet and at what time. This is all an atmept to break and systematically dismantle the worlds largest democracy to create Khalistan. DO NOT LET FOREIGNERS DIVIDE INDIA AGAIN. LOTS OF FARMERS THROWS OR SELL AT VERY LOW PRICES  AS THEY DON'T GET BUYERS AS THERE IS LIMIT ON HOARDING 
PRIVATISATION WILL HELP EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCE AROUND THE COUNTRY AND EXPORT.
FARMERS WILL PRODUCE WHAT IS IN DEMAND NOT LIKE TRADITIONAL RICE OR WHEAT ONLY"

Watch this video by finology for real facts and clarity

https://youtu.be/Oib04c4R6-U

Now this protest continues because congres and few khalistani gangs want it to continue whtgwre farmers want farm bills or not.( It's only their agenda that matters) 
Watch the link without fail"
Avinash Behera,"True questions shud be asked to the government always but  sirf sawal poochna hi kaam nhi he bro.
Sawal bhi poochna he government se , Saath BHI dena he with government for nation building.
Congress asks questions always during
 1) CAA 
2) 370 abrogation 
3) demobilisation
4) farm laws 
They blindly oppose everywhere
1) CAA ke liye Congress too was telling during manmohan Singh rule but he told only for HINDUS to come back.

Modi government makes arrangements for ALL MINORITIES 
Hindus , Sikhs ,Christians parssis etc .
Hindu and Sikh Punjabi ladkiya get abducted ,raped , kidnapped converted etc isn't Modi government raising voice for them too and helping them through CAA ? 
Kashmiris r benefitted by 370. now elections , developed, roads, highways colleges  sab ho Raha
 he.
*Regarding farm laws*
U knw Punjab me Draconian laws against farmers , they will lose their land and many suicide because of such primitive laws.all those harmful laws , land acquisition by other party everything changed in this new farm laws.
Pehle MSP was there for 25 crops only even before these laws.so will that change if these laws happen ?? 
Corporate farming for farmers for lays company and others was happening earlier too and farmers wanted it in Punjab in 2008 and made a strike .
That's what this farm laws say now.

Even Congress wanted to bring these good changes .


But just because Modi government is doing it they blindly want to oppose it and misguide and create fears in minds of farmers and middle men to oppose it.

And few with khalistani mindset wish to break Punjab from India using this opportunity.
What does farm laws have to do with khalistan creation?? 
U too wish that ?? 

Government told it will postpone it even for 1.5 years when real farmers can share their worries what good things they want to maintain in the laws and what they want to change that can be discussed in the coming 18 months.

But the khalistani don't want strike and riots to stop and tell nhi 3 farm laws hatao , no BAAT cheet.
It's not farm laws now or poor farmers .
Unke vesh me it's just pro khalistani movement to break India. And u wish that too ?? Itna bas bolo bhai"
S. Saleem,I am so impressed with the selflessness and awareness of Indian farmers. There is only one point that is directly harming them other three seems to be (apparently) in favor of Indian farmers yet they anticipated the harm of these in long term and how these laws will effect common person and decided to fight against it. This level of selflessness can only be expected from a farmer. May they be victorious

For Aliana Chawla,"And the main problem is not the act or law; the problem is that the judiciary of India is so poor that you would have Indian law saying for instance ""making obscene videos is a crime or encouraging a movie porn maker is a crime in itself."" But, these people are celebrated on news channel every moment & are not penalised as per the law. 

So, bringing a law giving farmer right prices enabling them to enjoy their due share saying that farmers right will be protected after the legal agreement with the other party. 

I don't believe that it is possible, the reason is that the celeberated corrupt enjoys great power & half of the masses don't know that they are corrupt and address them as 'Saabs' & fear them as they are influential. 

Because criminals in suits or proper kurta pyjama in farming & other sectors enjoys good influence in the society and are a reason of crime done on many. 

It is first hard for a non-influential farmer to file his complaint. Even if he does, it is not easy to get justice along with that he has to face violence & threat if he is challenging a person who is extremely powerful because of his influence on other people. 

So, bringing law or amendments do not serve the purpose in any sector including farming till the respected influential criminal on tv & in the society are not referred as what they are in the society. 

So, that a criminal leader do not create people from the youth his fans on the basis of fake persona & slowly manipulates them to be extremely violent on the masses. Thus, it is better to say them what they are rather than calling them as 'Saabs' & giving the respected criminals acceptance."
Neha Vishal,"Barkha should certainly talk less, I m here to hear mr Raghuram Rajen only"
dave Duhre,Open markets produce the lowest prices which is not compatible with Indian farming because the farms are so small. Open markets always drive the rural population to the cities to become urban labourers. It does not produce a good society especially in the days of increasing automation.
CJS,She is the one no who is also a part of toolkit scam??
amit ganguli,Unfortunately what Dr.Rajan was saying doesn't suit the narrative the presenter would like us to listen to .Just see the summary given under the banner .you will not be able to line up half a dozen agri economists to speak against the farm laws.
avinash negi,Subsidy is not a solution. US and other countries are already paying a lot of subsidies to farmers. Only thing can save is making Mandis and other institutions strong which BJP or Congress will never allow. We need Kejriwal who is ready to fight with conglomerates.

Adarsh Mishra,"The other issue post  2014 is that the govt has failed to convey their stand to the common citizens, its a harsh fact be it any of their policies 
the opppsition is able to manipulate people into believing anything 
and the bjp govt is least bothered to reach out on ground to the common peple 
Have a look at the current scenario 
initially only a chunk of farmers from punjab were staging a ""rail roko"" andolan 
centre did nothing to convince them, oppostion took benefit and ammassed huge gathering at the singhu border, then farmers from Haryana, western UP were called in and they joined 
govt talked 11 rounds with their so called leaders but didnt tried much to reach other farmers on groun level 
and now what you see on 26th jan 
similar marches were taken out against the new laws in Mumbai, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu 
the BJP govt needs to come out of the bubble that 
""MODI NE KEH DIYA TOH AAM JANTA AAKH BAND KRKE MAAN LEGI""

Rajnish Raina,"Competition is good but the narrative that monopoly is always evil is absolutely incorrect. Secondly monopoly can occur in fair competitive environment also. As an analogy of cricket suppose a batsman single handedly scores lot of runs and rest of his team mates fail that does not mean the batsman has done injustice to his team mates and should be ridiculed. India has suffered a lot due to this leg pulling crab syndrome. Government is ofcourse responsible for uplifting masses, but not at the cost of being unfair to able people."

jnanendra das,"I used to believe Raghuram Rajan as an economist . But he has become a politician to be in news.
1:Can Raghuram Rajan tell us why are we  cultivating items which is more in excess, than the country requires? Why the farmers do not cultivate which the country needs & which can be exported profitably?
2: Since MSP for grane  is higher than market, we can not export it profitably.
3: With higher MSP, subsidised fertiliser, free power, we are giving farmers incentive to cultivate excess  Paddy & wheat destroying water table & soil. 
This is not sustainable. MR RAJAN should advise the farmers what is better for all farmers & for the country.
4: India is crying for farm reform & nvestment.
For long farmers of Northern India  have taken country for granted.  Buying at MSP million tons of grane get wasted every year at tax payers cost. Modern technology & scientific agriculture is ned of the hours to sustain in agriculture. 
We should have berrer Insurance & other facilities to increase farmer's income. Farmers  are misguided  by politics, middle men. We had all sympathy at the beginning. Govt. Is willing to listen & address their anxiety. But they insist for reversal of all laws which is unreasonable. Any group of people can come and demand reversal of any law making  India to be a Banana Republic. Their stubborn behaviour is shameful & they are loosing sympathy of public. Now people do not care."

Sudhir Kumar Negi,I know it is hard for Rajan to appreciate anything about BJP policies given the history. GST was a process forever in consultation till BJP implemented it. You will never have a perfect law. It is always a WIP. In India we always stall any change. We are status quoist by nature.

Dindigal Thambi,"Can you please tell me why these protests ???
NO mandi markets closed ,
 NO MSP and subzidies  stopped 
 NO  FCI godowns  shut down.
NO Ration system  stopped.
Govt Did not compell to sell your products to corporates.
Instead farmers are getting an opportunity to sell your product in various other markets as well as to corporates. Even farmers can store their products ,  without the fear of any case.

Since INDIA is a member of *WTO * , low cost food materials, palmoil, rubber ....all these type of items will come to india from different nations at a low price. So the corporates have a choice. One more thing i want to tell you is that,  during covid time also , more foriegn cars were sold out , rather than indian made cars. People love to travel in mini cooper, or ford rather than INDIAN made NANO or MARUTHI car.  
THESE are all political game
These politicians especially communist party is muddying the water, spreading  chaos about the bill.
It is the communist party , which made several protest in 1970 , when tractor was introduced in india. Similarly at the time of computerisation and CAA, and opposed appointing Abdul kalam as the President. 
Farmers have the choice of selling to corporates or in mandi . Modi has clearly said that "" the system of MSP will remain , government procurement will continue and subsidies will never be stopped"" . Then what else you want?
Every state has an agriculture department and minister. If any problems or crisis arise , central govt will interfere and take action at the right time. MODI is trying to help the farmers

ishtiaq ahamd,"Present BJP, ruling dispensation and specially Modi regime, and I reckon it won't unfair, if I May described this fascist regime as, A Hitler's and Nazis of a Modern era.
Frankly, Modi Govt, Has been doing everything Constantly, to Curtail and ruined, every prescribed, Basic fundamental principles and Norms. Essentially, those imperative & legitimate constitutional rights, Which is being granted, and being given to every citizen of this country.
Given the circumstances, it seems to me as if, in Modi's opinion, citizens of this country shouldn't be even allowed to express or exhibit, any reluctant, Neither They should be entitled to have any further rights to Object, disagree, Or show any signs of dissatisfiaction against this present Modi regime, By any democratic manner and means.
In fact, such mindset itself goes literally against the essence of any vibrant parliamentary democracy.
No my friend, This is not the same democracy people of INDIA, had fought for unitedly, and sacrifice Alot. No certainly Not.
You may call it Hitler Shahi, dictatorship, Nazism, or Whatever you may called it. But certainly no longer you can ever justify such unconstitutional act in any vibrant democracy.
If there is any Voice of dissent against this Modi regime, be it From any individual, political opponents, or From it's rivals, either it will be silent by force, or it will be crashed, and will be decimated literally...
If govt, has passed any legislation in parliament, and Genuinely they're intending to do something for the upliftment, and betterment of its own citizens, Then why  is it, Modi govt is so terrified and scared of their own people?
They should explain them straightway, and if at all this bill is drafted for the benifit of Indian farmers, definitely they will understand.
However, contrarily to government claim same hasn't been the case exactly, in fact this legislation has been brought just to benifits few of government capitalist friends, as simple as This.
So, The bottom line is, irrespective of the situation, And no matter what the Modi government does, Just Always be a yes man in this fascist Modi regime. if at all u wanted to be called a True Nationalist, and a patriotic, if not simply you will be labelled as a khalistani Terrorist.
Bare in mind Always, Given the precent situation within the country, Your blanket support to Modi Govt, Only determine your patriotism.
Now it's up to you, Whether you wish, and desired to be called as a Nationalist, or a Anti National?
So, You better decide, and take a call upon."

Navjot Singh ਸੁਖਾਲਾ,"Hello guys,
Supreme courts order on stay its a trap govt jiski govt uski court this is modi raj.....
They know if we put stay on bills the protest will be over and we will implement it later ... and i know supreme court cant repeal these bills coz this is not a judicial error its a political mistake of modi govt nd modi govt will have to repeal it... farmers leaders has said we will not follow this stay or whatever.... only want to repeal bills
And here are 3 points which was said by supreme court yestery and few weeks ago govt also said these same things in meeting
1. Stay on laws
2. Send back women and children(they are our backbone of protest which we cant) coz govt know on youth we can do violence and it cant be a peaceful protest anymore
3. Make a committee (obviously it will favour govt)

And some people are saying why farmers are not going to supreme court ... let me tell that it will be a long procedure of 4-5 years and in those years your every food product will be marked as adani, ambani agro ltd."

Crafty Minds,That's the Problem of our country ..nobody wants to be neutral and just rely on facts and the truth...such a informational video has only 16k views and that Propagandist Akash banerjee has millions...
Omkar Sargar,"Very well explained sir. I very much understood the need and the relevance of the first 2 acts. 
But still I don't understand the need or relevance of the amendment of The Essential Commodities Act. The point you mentioned that farmers will also be able to hoard their produce would have been relevant if the farmers of India had that kind of money and resources to do so. According to the data of the GoI,  82% of the farmers are marginal and small farmers who depend on the earnings of their produce to fill their stomach, hence they wont be able to hoard their produce. However on the other hand large companies and traders can now hoard the produce and sell it at higher rates. Almost 22% of the population lies below the BPL and even the next 20-25% of the people won't be able to purchase essential commodities like potato and onions if their prices rice by almost 100% .
I would like to hear your opinion on this sir.
Thanks again for the wonderful explanation"

Aman Agrawal,Sir your all opinion is completely right but sir we have a political issue that you are currently said why the punjab and haryana are doing massive protest because the revenue generated from agriculture is huge profitable for state government of punjab and this made him to less dependent on central government.  If all powers are centralised into one hand then this opppose the concept of power sharing in democracy punjab show a good experience of governing state and this profit can  be benefited for people of punjab

Divyansh Yadav,"As always best of the best teacher, 
Sir, do you also teach law students???"
lovepreet singh,"Sir with all due respect, how clearly uh teach politics instead of polity......
This lecture is supposed to be just about merits and demerits of the 3 acts but I admire your smartness how smartly uh teach us politics.....

Because I am not interested in politics too so I directly goes to various issues involved in these said acts :- 
1. APMCs have to pay various duties which the Pvt mandis need not pay l, which leads to complete take over by Pvt mandis as a result APMCs will not exist in future. So it's indirectly closer of APMCs
2. When APMCs will not be there so the question of MSP automatically faced out without even mentioning it.
3. In the very first instance, these Pvt players will give a handsome return to the farmers produce but it won't be continued. And also the dispute resolution authority is SDM. And our head of govt. Think that the SDM will listen to a farmer rather than a corporate.
4. As you said...that these laws r opening of doors for the reforms...sir sry to say bt these are opening doors to the capitalist class in agriculture, they already have the resources and the farmers will need next 3 generations to get to these cold storage resources.. how can someone even justify these opening of doors to the reforms for farmers....I am amazed......... 
 Last bt not the least ""the head of the government of India himself said 15lakhs in a/cs, facing out black money, strengthening of DEMOCRACY wide RTI amendment, organisational independence etc etc etc"".....

The last has nothing to do with politics"
Vitthal Bhingare,"Yes surely Sun will raise at the east in normal conditions so law not  needed. 
But tommorow if earth's rotation is revered then surely sun will not rise at east. 

Yes the same logic for MSP was applicable earlier when there was  no law for contact farming, now you have the law  which MAY hamper farmer interest. 

Substantial event is  that now you have law about Contract farming, so why gov is not assuring farmers that MSP will be applicable to corporates by adding simple term into new law."
JASKARAN WALIA,"Sir, first time i do not agree with u
1. There are some cm's in india who are saying, we won't buy and sell crops of other states. 
2.  The other thing u are talking about is contract basis, just think if any conflicts happen, will the poor farmer will really have money to fight against the power like adani ambani in courts.. 
3.  The 3rd thing you are talking about storing crops and commodities, in this the only problem is faced by the middle class peoples like us. Storing of crops have resulted in onions tomato potato touching in 100/kg...some farmers in india, who grow crops are utilized by their family itself, will they have money to buy cold storage ware houses, and if they take on rent, then rent problem. 

What you are saying abhi darwaja khula hai etc etc, jb hmko pta hai ki vo darwaje k piche khayi aur kuoa hai to main vo darwaja q kholunga.... Simple as that..."
raj sawarn,Sir please start law optional we haven't got our backs covered there...we want u there sir plz
Sapna Sharma,One issue  with these farm act is that it's an state subject and Centre didn't even discuss with state and farmer communities and organisation

DISU Rana,Thank you sir.... Really got cleared about bill in one go
Kaushlendra Singh,"you said farmer is not enough educated to sell their produce digitaly......but is it educated enough to understand and bind himself in a complex legal contracts..?   
2- The farmers will go for only Cash crops
3- The basic food grains price get dependent on market forces
4- The monopoly of big companies may bound farmer to sell to them only, in what ever price the company agree ( eg- case of jio, wiping out competition and then establishing monopoly)
5-The companies may exploit soil, and use excess fertilizers to get higher yeild that can turn the land into barren and after some time when they can't get enough yeild they simply quit from the contract 
There are some more.....
like it...if you want to debate."

Sushil Singhal,"I believe, "" any agitation type movement needs public support and sympathy to be successful.""

Here what has been observed that the so called leaders of agitating farmers , having fears and apprehensions, are not following the laws of natural justice to seek redressal by:-
1) not listening to the Ministers, PM, even the laws enacted.
2) not listening their State Govt who had passed in their lagislation for not following these three laws. Punjab Govt has directed their public not to follow the Central Laws.
3) not following the direction of HON'BL Supreme Court for joint discussions.
4) not believing the assurance given by the highest level in the Govt.
5) utter disregards for the inconvenience caused to the public.
6) not caring, when other States in India are happy with the laws.
7)also by uttering derogatory remarks/abuses against the Govt officers, leaders, Supreme Court, press reported. 
8) going against their own manifesto given pre- election period. 
9) by seeking support of the opposition parties. 
10) Tarnishing the Image of India by advertising their propoganda in foreign countries till final outcome. 

I say, ""Such attitude not only tarnish the image of such agitation, also disheartened the Govt machinery.""
Jai Hind."

1.There is no legality for minimum support price 
2.Before also no one stop if farmers sell their produce anywhere in india 
3.Major defect in this black laws is farmers can't go to court if they got loss from the corporates with this black law
4.After the contract if prices are up then farmers still have to sell for least price and it leads to huge crruption and is useful for brokers , mediators and whoever have power
5.Due to monopoly  and high power in corporates - they will force farmers to sell/contract for free 
6.More than 87% of indian farmers are very small - like less than 3 to 4 acres so all these farmers can't sell their produce other than local markets due to very high transportation charges"

U take any   traditional seed production areas in the country, formers will prefers seed production of seed companies than their own traditional cultivation.The reason is, farmers are getting better profits in seed production (i.e contact farming) than traditional cultivation.

Dilbagh Singh,"If the laws are formulated in this manner in the name of majority by distorting the provisions in the constitution like in the case of these three controversial farm laws converting the state list to concurrent or to the central list conveniently,the very purpose of the incorporation of these provisions specifically made by the constitution makers will be defeating its purpose.On this basis, on a certain day this government can pass any other bill harming any community by distorting the provisions in the constitution. The Honble SC should see to it and the intention of this government behind passing the bills in violation of the federal structure of the country.On the face of it the three laws cant stand the scrutiny of the legal position. The Supreme Court should also see the matter of insult and humiliation of the farmers branding them terrorists etc behaving in a most insulting and humiliating manner through the  certain media and its blind bhagats sticking to it being its beneficiaries in one way or the other."
Shyam Majumdar,It's time that the judiciary stepped in to save democracy.....3 Cheers
ASHOKE DHOLE,This is a got up game between the Supreme court and BJP Government  to keep the Farm Act in abbeyance. The farmers have rightly decided not to  adhere to such decisions. The Farm Act has been enacted by the government without consulting the farmers in advance only to facilitate the Corporate Sectors  so the law should now be repealed by the Government.

MIjanur Rahaman Mollah,"After 48days and 60 more deaths, Staying 3 farm laws and forming panel by SC is simply an attempt to send back the farmers on road to their residence. In the name of discussions government have wasted time to demoralise the farmers. SC's motive is not clear  i.e. whether it is trying to save the face of the government or the lives of farmers."
Basha Mohamed,"Perhaps, all are drama for abrogate the planned tractor rally towards Delhi . We Never admit any authority at any cost to dismiss  the gatheration.  court could have to stop implementation before Law activated or before immolated 60 Martyrs. 
             If once scattered farmers or dispersed over to mother villages or  diminished the accumulation or withdrawn  the protest , surely potency of unity will deplete. moreover, dynast would never allow once again gather for mob or protest against them.  even if New law temporarily stayed by Court,  will gradually be injected without aware of anyone.
         So we, the people of India must bring forth over Monarch that  ""unconditional withdraw"". It is
 mandatory for safe  of our offsprings and our
 nation too."

Vivin Vincent,unbelievable.. just scrap the laws..
Mohan Ramaswamy,"A dispassionate view. So from now onwards, if at all any govt wants to pass any law, it should maintain a record of consultations it made with the parties concerned before making it and interest of  crores of people can be taken for a ride  by just 5000 people who agitate against government and immobilise common men. Good precedence. Whatever happening (as per holy  ""Geetha"" saying) is only for good."
Jericho Kharpyngrope,"It's a drama played by the supreme court ,due to republic day parade"
Sheriff Mohamed N,The ultimate solution is to scrap the three Farm laws. Staying the laws are eye wash
Bhevin,Stay... until further orders....further orders when ? After 6 months ? Is there a timeline when the recommendation will come ? One more ploy....to buy time...and...weaken the farmer mentality and physically ?
farid shaikh,This is not win for farmers as govt. Don't want to bow in front of farmers used supreme court to use this tactics so farmers will end agitation...y SC has not told govt. To take back such laws...fooling farmers tactically

It's drama played by Court with government as director"
Bharati Khandale,Very gud
Ren Sin,"At least, to strike a compromise, Govt. need to have a seperate agency to act as a business resource center for the farmers in each state that they can go to; to give them business guidance, teach them business & negotiating skills etc.  
Without that, it's like throwing them out of the ship and they're saying, they don't even know how to swim"

Shubh Shubham,"The history of big companies in agriculture across the world shows that small farmers are unable to compete and get uprooted once big players enter the market. Arecent study of contract farmingin the Moga, Tarn Taran and Amritsar proves this point for India as well"
Shubh Shubham,"new farm laws is a lifeline for big corporates who are keen to enter the only space where demand is always ever-present: food supply. This feeling is compounded by the Modi government's reluctance to make MSP a law. If these legal changes are going to help farmers get better prices in the open market, then what is the problem in legally fixing floor prices every year? After all, if private procurers are going to pay more, the government will never actually have to pay the MSP, and it will cost the exchequer nothing. 

No one believes that the existing APMC system is good. But the opposition to these new laws isn't just coming from those who believe in 'socialist' solutions. There is also the example of the successful milk cooperative movement in Gujarat's Amul and its offshoot, Mother Dairy. What stopped the Modi Government from introducing new laws that would facilitate, fund and legally protect such cooperatives in farming? That's a question even the greatest votary of capitalist farming cant answer"
No One,"Compare India's progress in Gandhi Congress time  and Compare it's progress under Modi ji our PM so understand the difference.
Understand how we are progressing at a large scale under Narendra Modi. 
But the people are brainwashed by Congress (idiotic party) and are constantly finding problems in BJP and Narendra Modi ji. 
Yaar thodi to sharam karo!!"
No One,"Sir you are absolutely right.

Farmers in the Other Parts of India don't have a single problem and why do these punjab farmers have a problem? Congress the opposition government is creating chaos in India against BJP and Narendra Modi. And the Farmers of the Rest of the India came to protest against these farmers protesting for no reason. Making innocent faces won't  make you great and develop stympathy for these fake farmers in no smart person's heart. These are Khalistani people and kisan andolan is just a name but they are the Khalistani supporters. These people protested with the Khalistani flag in USA also at the same time and they said it was all linked and planned.

And why would any farmer stay antil their need in their farms? Why will they remain wasting their time in protests during their Sowing and Harvesting season. No farmers who would actually be suffering would wait for so long for any purpose during their Sowing and Harvesting season. Starting from 9th August and continued for 7 months and 2 days. Can any farmer stay for so long. No they can't. Then who are these? They are the fake farmers or Not an Indian. Because no Indian would create Chaos on the Republic Day of his/her country India!

""Jai Jawan Jai Kisan"" is a slogan famous in India. Now will any True Indian and a True Kisan (farmer) create a chaos on the Red Fort in India that too on an important day for India which is it's Republic Day. These fake farmers on that day beated the police, destroyed the government things and harmed at the Red Fort. Why is this not highlighted. Why is it not highlighted that how come only Farmers from Punjab have issues with the new law introduced?????
This is all dirty plans of Congress."

Balvinder Gill,"Farmers have not allowed any political parties on their stage. They want it to remain a TOTALLY Kisan Andholan - esp.since ALL political parties have pretty much done nothing for them.

If elected politicians,political opposition, and Staye governments properly discharged their duties, these laws would never ha e passed, or they would be being played in courts by state governments, and Kissans would NOT be in this Andholan.

They are here b/c they see a certain death with these laws and so they see no choice but to stay here in harsh conditions. Over 216 people have died while sitting in these dharnas."
Balvinder Gill,Modis change means Privatising everything owned by govts by peoples money and selling it to Corporates for pennies to Adani/Ambani!!!  And then having their money elect him forever!!!!!
Balvinder Gill,"ALL Indian want is roti, kapda, makan!!! We are all so SICK of Hindu/Muslim polarisation/politics.

Wake up people and save democracy!!  Save people if I do a from Catastrophy that is the making!!!
WTO/IMF/Worls Bank will not come to ypur aid when hundreds of millions will die of hunger - just like in the1960s when Indians could not produce enough and then the Green Revolution came thanks to Lal Bahadur Shastri and lead by Punjab/Haryana!!!"
Balvinder Gill,"If these laws were as good as you/go to.says they are. There is no way that the go t. Would have told the farmers toAMEND as much as they wanted but to just leave theKhalee dabba/empty box!!!!

These farm laws will harm India and hundred of millions will die of  HUNGER.meanwhile Ambani/Adani will get richer and the WTO/World Bank/IMF will be happy too for once again they done to sit fos what East India Company did!!!"
Balvinder Gill,"India caNOT impose these laws in farmers b/c they have NO JOBS into which to absorb the farmers.

They cannot match the IS, Canada, Europe etc b/c those countries:
- industrialised o et 100-200 years and have jobs foe their people!
-have education, healthcare, other social security programs to help people in need.
- have STRONG democratic institutions that actually work!
India has none of these therefore we need to develop as a country BEFORE we can impose these on farmers.

2% of Indians already live below the Poverty  guidelines. If 65% are in agriculture,over thenext 3-10 years, how many more will join these?"
Balvinder Gill,"Farmers need Swaminathan  Report recommendations legalised so that they can get a fair price for their produce. Nothing else!!!!

BJP promised in 2014 it would be their first Act in government to Didi! And then? A year later they gave an affidavit to Supreme Court that they will not do so because thatll increase inflation! Politics? Lies? Marking a fool of farmers???"
Balvinder Gill,"The farm laws are KALA at the core:
1. UNconstitutional - only STATES can make those laws and bot the Cemtral govt.
2. Suspending them for 18/x months is HOGwash - Supm.ct needed to declare them UNconstitutional so the question of suspension does not even arise
3. All of National Bar Associations and ALL those Vakeels like BhanuPratap who are Supporting the farmers - do you think ypur qualification to read/analyse these laws are better than them???
STOP the nonsense."

If the farm laws are so good, why the government suggested for amendments....
If the farm laws are so good, why the government is offering it's suspension for one and half years..
How can you say that the laws passed in parliament without any discussion are so good...

If the bjp leaders have no courage to reach out to the people of Punjab, Haryana and West UP to defend the farm laws, how good are these laws for the farmers..."
King0Jingaling,"What a fool you are, this is obviously a BJP Fanboy channel but why lie to BJP supporters? There is ZERO benefit to farmers from these laws, they ONLY EXIST TO ENRICH CORPORATIONS. The same corporations that fund the BJP. The second they're repealed the protest will end. Modi and his goons are playing politics, but the farmers just want to get on with their lives. The hundreds of farmers who have died so far didn't give their lives for 'politics'. THIS IS NOT A GAME."

Jessie Plays Music,5 mins in an confused as fuck
shafiq morr,he sees nothing wrong with the laws. wow
Hardik Doshi,"I feel that this farm bill proposed by Gov. needs some changes & amendments to imply that our most diligent & hardworking farmer brothers get their truly deserving  rewards:

1) Need to define the Regulated framework where Government will oversee & monitor the Contract farming deal presented by Private Entity.

2) Government need to formulate the law & create the framework which ENSURES that farmer should be funded with the promised amount as per the contract.

3) If any Private company tries to BACKOUT from the promised price then need to frame laws to suspend their functioning license. Such that way strict laws will PROTECT our hardworking farmer community.

Farmers WERE, ARE & WILL BE the foundational & core asset of Indian Economy. So need to focus on empowering  & prospering our farming community to see the strong economy & growth of India  on the global platform.

Jai Jawan Jai Kisan"

GURPREET SINGH Randhawa,Not agree on many  points.  There is no credibility of present government keeping the historical records in mind.

After having watched Mr. Modi's very convincing speech in the parliament, we do not think so. There may come some minor adjustments to the law but there will be no withdrawal. Any one who underestimates Mr. Modi has been rewarded with a red face in past and you have been too sir! But there is no shame in being proven wrong by a able leader of the country who has a proper and correct agenda that has come in at the right moment in India's history. Besides the biggest losers are the Punjabi farmers and Punjab as a state. After this rowdy agitation on the 26th Jan, which industrialist will dare to open a factory in Punjab? While the rest of India is industrialising, Punjab will be bypassed. They are already on a downhill spiral on agricultural profits and the only thing that could save them (i.e. industry) is not going to happen. I hope their chief minister is reading this.

I have seen with my own eyes how farmers were looted by the agents under the mandi system. In Kota, for eg, it was common for agents to fix two prices for a single lot of mustard, both of them explorative. The plight of farmers was unbearable. Similar scenes were witnessed in states like UP, MP etc. Things were slightly better in Maharashtra. Though these happened about 15 years back, I knew for a fact nothing much has changed. The new laws are a great move by the Government. However, much needs to be done through contact programs and awareness campaigns on a really massive scale. There are trusted NGOs in rural India that will do this job for a small fee gladly. I wonder why this is not being done even while the agitation is going on. It is so easy to expose these opportunists!"

We Are All Aware Of The Fact That  Protests are  NOT  Farmer's Protest, But POLITICALLYSPONSORED CHAOS...ala  SHAHEEN-BAGH""..

It's a CAREFULLYMANUFACTUREDCONSPIRACY  by the CONGRESS-JIHADI-LEFTIST-NEXUS  AGAINST The Modi Govt..!!!

The  NEFARIOUSDESIGN  of the CONGRESS-JIHADI-LEFTIST-NEXUS  to Gin-Up  farmers into launching protests AGAINST The Govt NEEDS To  Be EXPOSED . 

The CONGRESS-JIHADI-LEFTIST-NEXUS  has been INSTIGATING Farmers Under The Garb Of Sikhism & Guru Govind Singh To Participate In These Congress Leftist Sponsored Protests. 

The Congress & Leftist Roaches averse to the Modi Govt have been resorting to LIES & PROPAGANDA To MISLEAD  FARMERS into believing that the 3-Farm-Laws are  against their interests. 

When some farmers died a NATURALDEATH, Photos of the Dead were circulated in far-off villages in Punjab stating that they were Martyred during the farmers protest in Delhi in order to generate resentment against the Modi government. 

The farmers are also FEDLIES  that demonstrators are dying in the protest while the government is simply watching over.
The propagandists are goading people into joining the protests in the name of Sikhism & Guru Govind Singh. Those who oppose them are branded as enemies of the community & are threatened with banishment from the society and this is all happening under the pretext of farmers protests, Sharma said.

Appeals are being made to Sikh pride and Guru Govind Singh to get farmers to participate in the protests. 

The JihadiLeftist Organisations had been BEFOOLING FARMERS in villages to join the protests & when the LIES about new farm bills did not stick, the leftists tried to enlist them for the protests by citing Sikhism & Guru Govind Singh.

When farmers started to realize that the furore over the 3-Farm Laws is unwarranted, the Jihadi -Leftist Organisations started linking the protest to the Sikh pride. 

Comrade leaders even defrauded money from villagers to finance Delhi protests. 

Almost ALL THE  PROTESTERS  in Delhi are LEFTIST SUPPORTERS  & cadres. 
Farmers may have joined the protests but they were deceptively enlisted for the protests by appealing to Sikh pride.."
Anna na,shame on NDTV...why didnt you do show on farmer suicide
santosh kumar,"1. The three farm bills are already in place and working fine as of now 
and they are part of congress , bjp, ncf parties 2019 election manifesto.
ex farmer minister of ncp and present congress chief minister of punjab also 
supported the same reforms in the past. Now all oppositon parties change their stand and making farmers scape goat.

2. post dialogue with farmers and govt ,On december 9th clarified with 10 point 
amendment
 that all the doubts farmers posed and will be tabled in next session of
 parliament. But protesting farmers unions change stand after dec 9th 
and want full repeal.

3.  In 2019 farmers can't sell their 
produced rice/wheat/vegetables etc out side of the district or county 
and cant sell to any one outside of the APMC market yards/mandis and 
farmer has to pay 8.5 percent fees( 3% to market yard improvement, 3% to
 district development , 2.5% to licensed commision agents). In some 
markets they collect both  from seller and buyer each 8.5% . These new 
2020 farm laws allows farmers to sell  to any where in india to any one .
 no restriction. It is upto local government to  charge needed cess or 
fees.

4. In 2019 only 10% of total agriculture produce (mainly 
wheat and rice)was bought by government agency FCI (Food Corporation of 
India as a stockpile for emergeny security) . 85% was purchased by 
private buyers . In 2019 only 15% of produce of total agriculture was 
purchased at minimum support price (MSP) and rest was purchased at lower
 price. Till 2010 the minimum support price was lower than the 
international price of the goods. After 2010 the minimum support price 
was increased higher than international price and no exporter is
buying at msp except govt agency and all godowns of FCI agency are full with 4.5 trillion tonnes of wheat and rice .

5. who is at loss due to this farm bills of 2020 are 


   A. punjab state governments who charge 3% cess for district 
developement will loose around 15000 millions  (1500 crores) indian 
rupees per year income.  

   B. the punjab licensed commision agents (who are mainly punjabi sikh jat caste landlords )who get 2.5% 
charge  per transaction thro markets will loose 1000 crores (10000 
million) rupees per year only in punjab state.

   c. Other than punjab and haryana no other state charge district fees and market cess 
and they charge only commision agent fees. Some states there are no 
markets/mandis like in kerala (since 1980) and bihar (since 2008).

6.  The funding for protest is happening by charging 500 rupees per farmer .
 80% farmers own only less than 2 hectres /5 acre land.

7. The foreign punjab seperatist/secissionist group sikh for justice announced 1
 millon dollars as donation and indian banks stoped the 
   distribution asking account holder to show FCRA ( Foreign control regulatory) registrants for permission

8. All want farm reforms. Punjab and Haryana farmers unions want to repeal
 and rest of indian country farmers  are happy that they can sell 
anywhere. I think if central/union govt gives that 1500 crores to punjab
 govt per year and 1000 crore to punjab commision agents it will stop."

Nature Peace,"The Partition of India & Punjab was not accepted by the Panjabi community mainly Sikh as large parts of Punjab given to Pakistan moreover most of Sikh holy site were found in the Pakistani side of Punjab..

Infact founder of Sikh, Sri Gurunak Saheb was born in Pakistani side of Panjab
In 1966 sardar were on the street against CM Bhargawa for seprate nation or atleast separate Punjabi state with exclusively for Sikh people. 

Not only that they said we only want Sikh CM in Punjab otherwise we will riot..

Again this is exactly what started to happened all the non Sikh either kicked out or killed or converted into Sikh and since then the CM of Punjab were only a Sikh...

There are plenty of committe reports recommending new farm laws. Its been happening from past 20 to 25 years.
__ What was the need for this new committe?
All farmers groups have said, they reject supreme court intervention.
__ What is the use of judgement, when it will be rejected?
The greatest tragedy is, courts are always correct/great/unquestionable/ultimate.
__ Why don't any one question courts?
It's all same clerical work running round and round repeatedly indefinitely. Exactly like court procedures/ adjournments.

Truth Lover,"Well, THE FACT IS THAT USA HAS SIMILAR LAWS THERE, so how can they oppose it. 

They began with big farms and have much new history as compared to India where farms get divided with every generation since long. 

Farming is not a main occupation in USA while in INDIA it is. 
USA has always been advocate of corporatism. 

USA and many other countries are seeking their own benefits in these farm laws as it would effect international trade. 

USA would get opportunities to invest in Indian farms which is again benefit for them at the stake of small and already poor farmers. So USA would support farm laws for their own benefits. 

Again, USA HAVE BIG FARMERS OWNING LARGE LANDS while India has many SMALL FARMERS, 
Over That, USA HAS WAY  LESS POPULATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT AS COMPARED TO INDIA 
SO IF SOMEONE CANT do farming there , They can either survive on welfare benefits or have another Job. 

BUT FOR THE FARMERS OF OUR COUNTRY, Where would they go without farming....we already have a huge rate of UNEMPLOYMENT. Dont forget, EXPLOITATION BY CORPORATES WOULD BE WIDESPREAD."

Punjabi Class,"These farmers are protesting against 3 controversial laws that were hushed through parliament in the pandemic, without consultation of the farmers. The laws are taking away the livelihood and legal rights of the farmers in the name of 'reforms' by giving the PM's fellow Gujrati corporate giants, authority to control agriculture. The present PM has already sold various public assets to these corporates. This will push the prices up of crop in the future which will be beyond the reach of the ordinary Indian. These farmers are feeding millions free of charge through Gurdwaras, Langars when disasters occur worldwide, or at protests as we see it on YouTube. A lot of protestors and freelance journalists are going missing. The police have arrested many by fabricating charges. It is being falsely reported that these protestors are terrorists. These farmers have sons in the army and police, guarding the dangerous indian borders, so these rich people can sleep at night. The present PM is Gujrati. Gujratis tradionally do not have soldiers that sacrifice their lives for India. Farmers are intelligent, honest, hardworking, truthful people that trusted and voted for the BJP government, but now realise that they have given platform to an elected dictator. BJP, since it's election have implemented anti Muslim laws, caused divisions on the ground of religion and is now portraying the Sikhs as an anti national element. This has outraged the Sikhs worldwide who have fought for the independence of India from Mugals and British. The actions of the PM are fiercely contested by the public to the extent that the government have used tear gas, batons, barbed wired and concrete barriers to silence the protest. There are more barricades at the protests than at the borders of China. This has got attention worldwide so now the government is trying to defend its actions. It is not rocket science to understand that when controversial laws are forced on the public, it will cause outrage."

Kuldeep Singh,"Not farmers, only farmers from Punjab are protesting...trains are shut down due to covid...middlemen and mandis are removed to eradicate overlap of prices....msp is intact....so what's the problem....laws are getting unified for farmers across the country...punjabi farmers are one if the wealthiest in the country and these laws since getti g unified and streamlined will remove access from manipulating prices. These farmers want all cases against crop burning to retrieved, however crop burning is the major source or one of the source of pollution in delhi. This is hypocrisy at the highest level, now you understand why are we still called as third world country. We have laws, rules, government but everyone wants what fits their pocket..the punjabi protestors are going to bring a wave of covid and maje things worse for the healthcare system of the country. But do they care, NO, all they care about is hooliganism. Such a sad state for the country."

After this bill I can Sell my product to other state mandi people's where I get profit.
I strongly support this bill"

XBOX SERIES S Gameplays,"repeal the farm laws in punjab only, and let's see them difference after remaining states will get benefit or not after a year"
Noel b ainikkal,Farm bills are totally against farmers and poor farmers are not educated they can't understand the real problem that why other states are not coming forward but all are supporting panjabies. .. farmers are tagged as anti nationals.. Canadian president can understand farmers problems but Modi can't .
herbert jeffrin,"These laws actually benefit the small farmers because they need not pay mandi tax and commission and it will also benefit the consumers as they can buy it at low price. 
Farmers need to diversify the crops because FCI has too much surplus of wheat, rice and sugar which pretty much rotting in the godown and contract farming might allow this but govt needs to set up a board to overlook the contracts to avoid one sided contract from corporates, which has big legal team.
Mandi's won't go away because of liberalisation of agriculture sector since govt has to buy produce at MSP from farmers for ration shops, so people need not to worry."
SRIKAR Sowbhagya,Farmers have fears but Govt failed to address those fears..... It has become practice in India to hate corporates but remember those are the one who pay taxes and provide employment opportunities
Rohit,Real farmers from all over India must stage a demonstration in favor of the pro-farmer Farm bill.
amit kumar,"Farmers are right.

Such farm law has been already failed in USA"
you never know,"See. It's all believe believe believe. Even i will support anybody if they say ""in this bill in this page no. this point is not good"". But that was not the case. I will like to support the new farm bill. Being critical is okay but cannot be always negative about everything."
you never know,I saw TOI (Times of India) article which says the new farm bill is 2nd green revolution. I think the farm bill is good compared to previous ones. But our government is still not good in conversing with the opposition's target points before any protest. We saw this even in Anti CAA although CAA was essential.
Andru Pine,They are not farmers they are the middle man.
Awesome Video,"I think you didn't properly give details of 1 first law. Farmer have options either to sell products in APMCS or outside the APMCS. If farmers don't like to sell outside than they can sell in APMCS. IF they want they can sell outside APMCS too. And farmers also got freedom to sell outside the state. 

3rd law I didn't like government should not have given permission to stock products."
r V,Punjab farmers stance and vision is flawed
madhav wadhawan,Instead of why not supporting crux should make a video why these laws are necessary for growth of agriculture sector development
Pranay Waghmare,"I just want to tell other people who are saying that farmers are brainwashed, 
There are thousands of farmers who are protesring, it cant be possible to brainwash thousands of people. So stop commenting under video while sitting on comfortable couch. 
If farmers dont want these bills then why govt. Want to apply it.?"
crazyology,"These farmer leaders not yet read the bills thoroughly, thats why they are protesting, APMC and MSP system will be same as before, Bill has given the option to sell outside of the APMC and get involve in contractual farming. Govt will regulate the prices if it crosses limits. Some of the political parties are taking advantage of this protest."
Anandh Selvan,"I agreed BJPs two farm bill which are 
1. Framer can sell their products directly to buyer with their own price fix, this make better income to formers
2. Farmers can make contract with Pvt/Corporate sectors to sell their products, this make big scale formers get financial/ technical/ agricultural support from Pvt/ corporate. 
But I disagree 
3. Relaxation in Essential commodities act should be reconsidered since it may cause to price hike by stockiest which will impact to common peoples."
dream guy,WTF? What is the logic here? These farmers due to middlemen used to get low prices for their crops. Now they oppose eradication of middlemen.
Anudeep Sudhati,"Something is fishy with Punjab farmers, they got brainwashed. If farmers use this laws properly they will be extremely helpful."

Pratinav P,This protest is completely baseless rather is based on very futile arguments.. the opposition and certain people are just creating propaganda on these progressive laws to potray modi govt in bad light. Oppose a few things we can understand.. but opposing everything we can't understand.. please explain to these farmers and my humble request to all people is don't fall for this propaganda and please support these progressive laws..

BBK MotoLove,"Modi says new laws are as pure as Ganga river lol.
Other promises from modi gov were as follows:
15lakhs per account
He said he will make petrol price eqaul to Diesel, now both are avg 80.
I think I don't want say anything about the economy anyway.

Now he say in words that msp is promised, enough of his fake promises. 
There is no msp in direct contracts, no gov intervention in direct contracts. Poor farmers who don't even know how to read or write, they won't understand the complications in every contract. When direct contracts gets approval, no buyers will go to mandis, thus end of mandis and APMC

Above all they have ammended the essential commodities act and don't explain why. There are no limitations in stocking essential commodities anymore, so next time if onion prices rise to 500, you'll have to buy it for 500, cause whoever controls the supply , can hoard it and decide at what price these essential commodities have to be sold."

Jitendra Singh Rathore,Punjab farmers subsidies from central government are higher than India's average farmers annual income. Now we can see that how much disproportionate in terms of annual earning income between Punjab farmers and rest part of the country's farmers. And I firmly believe these bills are gonna burgeoning the income of all farmers irrespective of their geographical belonging.

As far I think these farmers reforms bills will not effect badly on farmers. .so these protests are being carried out by some middle men like commission agents and hijacked by politics and antisocial elements. .Nothing else. .if someone feels some gray areas of the bills it can be resolved by peaceful process by Central Government and farmers. .I agree with your concerns about 3rd law about special commodity it can be further define by taking stringent steps like enactment of law stronger more. .

abhi thakur,"How will State Govt will be able to sustain? Centre is  not paying GST and now they want to remove other revenues also?
What is happening in India?
Is their any democracy left?
Where is our federal structure going?
Agriculture is a state subject then why there are not being asked?
Why Govt wants to force these bills on farmers when no one is accepting it in this form?
Shame on these people who know nothing about farming but giving their advices like anything."
amit patil,"Guys MSP is for only 23 items in India.Please read beforehand making comments.Milk has no MSP still people get it cheaper price due to competition and before 1956 there were no MSP in all items, at that time we were feeding whole India +british.

If one needs solutions with same rules we could have secured it in 50 years if not we need changes.

How can any private player come for storage if there were not allowed for storage.

Why one travels in red bus instead of roadways because we find its services more competitive and nice and while in Karnataka we use govt buses bcz they are good.

You can buy a coke of any company but a farmer cannot sell where he wants.

Please read the bill rather than just commenting only.

There r 2 points for msp
1)learn indian economy first.if MSP is made compulsory for private player too inflation wd haywire in INDIA
2)Govt cannot enforce private players to buy at MSP how can govt decide what a private person to buy at a price he decides,if yes than farmers wd farm only for those crops which are having MSP and other would not be sown
Than there would be huge supply and not equal demand.Same has happened in soyabeen etc.

Govt shud focus on production side of farming instead of supply side

Try to provide irrigation facilities.reduce effects of climate change on farmers.
Insurance has been provided by this government but shud be implemented to larger extend


There is a clause in bill that farmers and co-operate cannot make a deal on land of farmers whatever may be the circumstances.they can only make a deal on what is grown on land.

People say that cooperate would take advantage of farmers; how can they there is no demand problem in India ; if farmers don't like one deal he can opt for other.
If i don't like amul milk I can buy parag I can buy chitale 
Same is with selling.

Guys please read beforehand and make comments then.

Private players are not entering storage sector Why!!!!! Please check how much wastage of food is happening due to non storage after FSSAI purchase.

Government doesn't have that much money to build 100000 storages in India with good facilities.

Govt purchases raw material at MSP and 40% of it go waste.This is not me telling its 2014-15 report under some agriculture commision.I dp not remember the name now.

Sorry for such a long comment as it needed to be.

There can be some lacuna in bills but to say that its against farmers that's far from facts.

Let farmers get what they want and deserve"
kunal gupta,"Very good discussion. Sir  In future episodes of your show if possible please invite experts who are not directly associated with government and have a slight different viewpoints. It would help to understand concerns and negative points better and give an opportunity to other speakers to Clarify the concerns. 
Thank you."
abhi thakur,"If MSP is not going away, then add a clause that anyone purchasing below MSP will be penalised. If not, then that means that Govt wants to close FCI in some coming time and this is the start."
abhi thakur,"Punjab and Haryana should then get the royalties on food as other states are getting on petrol and other minerals such as Gujarat and Assam from ONGC, etc."
Keep Learning,"though the debate is informative but overshadowed the negative impact of bills like 1)why govt has not added MSP in any clause 2)Future of markets as hoarding is made legal 3)How it will overcheck the capitalist exploitation of farmers 4)why not first food processing units in-country should me be made competitive and increase productivity ..
Please try to call an expert who is not associated with any govt. institutions and subsidiaries.Any leader from farmer organization would be appreciated if called on debate
Thank you."

It is the educated population whose degree is not worth the piece of paper it is written on, but it pontificates on everything under the sun.

Again and again, some unruly and stubborn group of people, holds the entire nation ransom to have its way and it is applauded. Selfishness in this nation, is a celebrated virtue if you belong to certain spectrums of the society which can be hijacked for political causes. All this why? because the well meaning people would rather cling to an emotional humdrum and be conveniently lazy about reading and thinking. 

India bleeds with a thousand cuts, one ill-intentioned rebellion at a time.

BJP and Modi wants to ear huge profits by their supporters corporate companies like Adani, Ambani and etc. Example Apples for Rs. 12/- per kg from the farmers and companies given free hand by the BJP to sell to citizens for minimum price of Rs. 200/- maximum to extend for their huge profits to give the party fund to the pet political party. This present BJP, Ambani and Adani modern India. Citizens blood is squeezed by the BJP government."

Health Connect,"Wonder how the host will feel if tomorrow police beat the media anchors with sticks. You can imagine the outrage. A nation where a 20 year old policeman is beating a 60 year old farmer to make local politician happy. The nation has lost its soul now, nothing left ,to save. In our times we used to touch the feet of older people especially farmers and military, cant even think of even making eye contact with these people. But today Indian youth has no soul or principle, brought up by a mother that taught for money do anything . My parents would have died in shame if they saw me hitting a older person."
Health Connect,"Can you imagine a Chief Minister of a large state openly discussing that beating of farmers is necessary . What is next beating military people. The nation has lost its soul to few goons, while rest of the public is neutral or neutral. Imagine a son of a farmer in police is seen beating a old farmer violently , and the nation is not outraged, while the host is more interested to tell farmers to keep taking the beating and dont respond."
Health Connect,I think Modi needs to declare no more elections in future to convince Indians that democracy is gone two years ago. That will stop the struggle of Indians fighting these atrocities and make corruption more efficient and return nation to some growth path .
Health Connect,It was matter of time when a nation with so much corruption at all levels was going to move to the open corrupt system with oligarchs and autocrats with single dictator at top.
Health Connect,"Nexus of corrupt police, criminal politicians and now even corrupt IAS shows its best for all indians to lay low until the Modi dictatorship is fully implemented and you figure out where you belong. Congratulations first superpower with dictatorship, something Russia couldnt pull off, while China continues towards implementing democracy."
Health Connect,If Ambani and Adani and others have already made the payment through election bonds to BJP and Modi I am sure they are frustrated with the delay in implementation. When you buy corruption you expect it to be efficient. So sad you know end is near when the criminals stop following there commitments .
Health Connect,"She is so disrespectful towards the farmers guarantee if Adani or his type was being interviewed she would be very respectful, but at farmers she talks over them like she is talking to 3 year olds. I guess money matters in media"
Health Connect,While Indians youth is watching Indian  idol and media not showing the atrocities against the farmers since there owners are the one that will benefit with the new law implemented. How long can farmers take a beating without responding

Dilbagh Singh,"If he is defending SDM that shows there were clear orders from CM and then virtually this CM is virtually admitting by saying that strictness was necessary. Now the question arises: who is responsible for escalating the situation to this extent? Why option the farmers have in the given situation when you continue to insult them by using highly objectionable and disparaging remarks against them and have been trying to malign them by making misuse and abuse of the power in your hand  and for the last more than 9 months you have been keeping silent and not addressing and redressing their issues and are wanting to suppress their voice by using force which is not in consonance with the traits of the democracy. As regards patience, it is the farmers which are displaying patience and not this government. Unfortunate situation is also that Judiciary is also virtually allowing this government to do so by not taking cognisance of the matter when the government is bent upon thrusting upon the farmers the three illegally passed laws being unconstitutional and passed against the provisions of the constitution without following the due process of laws and also against the federal structure of the constitution.Whatever is happening in the country is not in the interest of the democracy."

deepak singh,Sensible things to say
Arsh randhawa,I call this ambush and bullying Indian farmers
santosh kumar,"1. The three farm bills are already in place and working fine as of now 
and they are part of congress , bjp, ncf parties 2019 election manifesto.
ex farmer minister of ncp and present congress chief minister of punjab also 
supported the same reforms in the past. Now all oppositon parties change their stand and making farmers scape goat.

2. post dialogue with farmers and govt ,On december 9th clarified with 10 point 
amendment
 that all the doubts farmers posed and will be tabled in next session of
 parliament. But protesting farmers unions change stand after dec 9th 
and want full repeal.

3.  In 2019 farmers can't sell their 
produced rice/wheat/vegetables etc out side of the district or county 
and cant sell to any one outside of the APMC market yards/mandis and 
farmer has to pay 8.5 percent fees( 3% to market yard improvement, 3% to
 district development , 2.5% to licensed commision agents). In some 
markets they collect both  from seller and buyer each 8.5% . These new 
2020 farm laws allows farmers to sell  to any where in india to any one .
 no restriction. It is upto local government to  charge needed cess or 
fees.

4. In 2019 only 10% of total agriculture produce (mainly 
wheat and rice)was bought by government agency FCI (Food Corporation of 
India as a stockpile for emergeny security) . 85% was purchased by 
private buyers . In 2019 only 15% of produce of total agriculture was 
purchased at minimum support price (MSP) and rest was purchased at lower
 price. Till 2010 the minimum support price was lower than the 
international price of the goods. After 2010 the minimum support price 
was increased higher than international price and no exporter is
buying at msp except govt agency and all godowns of FCI agency are full with 4.5 trillion tonnes of wheat and rice .

5. who is at loss due to this farm bills of 2020 are 


   A. punjab state governments who charge 3% cess for district 
developement will loose around 15000 millions  (1500 crores) indian 
rupees per year income.  

   B. the punjab licensed commision agents (who are mainly punjabi sikh jat caste landlords )who get 2.5% 
charge  per transaction thro markets will loose 1000 crores (10000 
million) rupees per year only in punjab state.

   c. Other than punjab and haryana no other state charge district fees and market cess 
and they charge only commision agent fees. Some states there are no 
markets/mandis like in kerala (since 1980) and bihar (since 2008).

6.  The funding for protest is happening by charging 500 rupees per farmer .
 80% farmers own only less than 2 hectres /5 acre land.

7. The foreign punjab seperatist/secissionist group sikh for justice announced 1
 millon dollars as donation and indian banks stoped the 
   distribution asking account holder to show FCRA ( Foreign control regulatory) registrants for permission

8. All want farm reforms. Punjab and Haryana farmers unions want to repeal
 and rest of indian country farmers  are happy that they can sell 
anywhere. I think if central/union govt gives that 1500 crores to punjab
 govt per year and 1000 crore to punjab commision agents it will stop."
武蔵宮本,So peaceful by so-called Farmers aka Khalistanis.
Imran Khan,"We have to demand resignation of MP s 
Government false then bill will be false 
Some body have to voice against resignation of MP s 
And also MLAs"
Janardhan Prasad D V S,"vWe have to know that anti-farmer sentiment was being spread among people for decades. It is not a new phenomenon. The very gruse against farmers emanates from the Bureaucrats. These Bureaucrats claim that farmers do not pay taxes. And government officials have been paying taxes compulsorily because their salaries are paid publicly. 

Now let us see what farmers pay to the government. Farmers pay Rs. 16,600 crore tax annually on purchase of pesticides. Rs. 3800 crore on purchase of Fertilizers. Rs. 4,500 crore on purchase of tractors. Total of these taxes works out to Rs. 24,500 crore per anum. IN addition farmers pay about Rs. 10,000 crore on purchase of farm implements such as pumpsets, micro irrigation systems etc. Then it can be seen that about Rs. 35,000 core is paid to the exchequers of States and Central govt annually. Whereas Central govt had been subsidizing farm sector to the tune of Rs. 1,20,000 crore only. In addition respective States waive off farm loans to the tune of Rs. 200,000 annually. 

And it is interesting to note that on an average India provides $ 48 (= Rs. 3600/-) per farmer as agricultural subsidy annually. Where as America provides $ 7000  ( = Rs. 5,25,000/-) subsidy per farmer. Total subsidy by Indian governments is Rs. 3,20,000 crore (= $ 42 billion). Surprisingly Indian government garners $ 40 billion annually from farm exports. USA provides $ 132 billion (= Rs. 9,63,600 crore) to its farmers annually. USA also gets income from farm exports to the tune of $132 billion annually.USA provides $ 132 billion (= Rs. 9,63,600 crore) to its farmers annually. Value of farm produce in India and the USA are same in dollar terms - $ 130 billions.  By the way let us also know how much other countries subsidize their agriculture. China $ 212 billion, Indonesia: $ 28 billion, Japan: $ 65 billion.

From this information we can easily understand why grains in international markets are cheaper when compared to that of India. Heavy agricultural subsidies by USA and other countries is the main reason for less production costs in other countries. Instead of increasing farm subsidies India is trying to handover agricultural lands to foreign companies who have lots of advantages like subsidies from their governments. And also availability of loans at Zero interest."

Why No Agriculture experts and stake holders are not consulted before launching these 3 new farm laws. Commission of Agriculture of Cost & Pricing a GOVT department ( CACP) issue MSP for 23 essential crops since last many decades, why GOVT of India not making MSP as law for implementation.

Please protest for better regulation of the farm sector rather than asking govt to revoke the acts. Do you guys want to be marginalized and at the mercy of political middlemen forever?
That land which you have for farming belongs to the country and not just to you.

So, to increase the output on a nationwide scale, fragmented pieces need to be brought together and cultivated en masse

Farmers individually borrowing loans for cultivation is stupid when corporate farming organizations can borrow loan for cheaper, in large scale and also relieve farmera of the debt burden"

Shrikant Prajapati,i think majority of the people don't know the fact that many mandis are also shadow banks. Mandi owners used to loan money to farmers in exchange for them taking their produce. These produce would then be sold to state govt at super inflated prices compared to the rest of the country. The mandi owners made good living but now that the source of income is gone because the farmers don't have to go to the mandi to sell their produce. They can sell it directly to who ever they want heck even the govt. But here comes the catch the massive amount of money involved in mandi loan business is huge. 25%of the farmers tbh the ones engaged in loan business could go broke as nothing is guaranteed anymore. The state govt procurement was done from produce directly produced by SAD and Congress politician owned lands. The sheer fukery that is going on in Punjab is messed up because they used tax payer money to procure produce at craxy inflated prices where the only beneficiaries were mandi owners once again many of them connected to political parties. NRI punjabi don't know jack shit and the moment celebrities got involved I knew politicians were involved in this.

Secondly why did Modi initiate this farm Bill during the pandemic. Couldn't he wait till Covid was over. .  That is show the govt bad intention towards the farmers.  Now if he wants the farmers to end protest he can rescind the laws or accept their demands. Do you think  farmers want to be there in this deadly Covid wave. They want to go home too. But he has too big ego to that. People are dying and there are no vaccines, food, oxygen and he is wasting Rs 20,00 crore on PM house and parliament building."

Secondly, the striking and supportive leaders like Kejriwal, Mamtha, Rahul, Tiket, Yadav etc have no common sense like normal people.   Because how can cancel the bill once passed in the parliament.  So the option is to solve the issue to sit with the supreme court committee and the farmers are given their grevencies.    The government already agreed to not adopt the rule for up to 1 1/2 years or still the committee report finalized.   This is the drama for the 2024 election to come to power and the great PM Modiji to bring down.   Voting against Modiji is the golden opportunities those are against India and will join and give a clear way to start play of terrorist with our neighbor countries.   SO WAKE UP NATION AGAINST THE UNLAWFUL  AND UNNECESSARY STRIKE.

GorgOFjngl,"I see the following issues with the three laws as implemented and dont think they resolve anything.
1. how are we expecting an Av. farmer (2hectares)  to negotiate for a better price and transport his produce to a far away market with a better price. In reality do we think a farmer has negotiation power now that he will have in a free for all?
2. With divested markets, how does a farmer know the price he will sell at is right. There is no basis as there are no mandis. If the price is coming from the largest buyers it is by large not a fair price for the seller it is what the buyer wants. So are we not creating a buyers marker?
3. The price for contract farming is indirectly tied to APMC price. Makes no sense, how can a price in a defined contract have a link to what the market price will be. Its unfair to both the buyer and seller if we allow this link and will lead to abuse. 
4. Subsidies for farmers are BS, we are selling farm inputs at relatively global prices to farmers, yet intend to and are buying from farmers at prices significantly lower than global prices. If you doubt it compare global wholesale agriculture spot prices and compare it to what we pay for them in India the gap is staggering. 
If the intent is to reduce subsidies then why not open up agriculture sell inputs at global prices and buy farm produce at global prices. Let the farmers leverage the low labor cost in India as their margin. Let the msp per we be the future contract price. Thus when the govt wants to give subsidy of cheap food to the below poverty line citizens there is one subsidy. 
Our problem is we want everyone happy and have no one happy and have system that is corrupt to the core. This also removes MSP and allows for substitution of imports.
5. The states where APMCs (PB, HR) exist the buyer pays the mandi tax (Apr. 2%) whereas in states without APMC (Bihar) the buyers are making the seller pay for cleaning, inspection and other charges relating to sale of produce. 
In brief the 2% is the cost that is required to do these functions. The end customer is going to bear it no matter what (we are not making produce 2% cheaper). Thus whats the point of changing it if the cost does not change. Looks like a change is just to transfer this cost from buyer to seller. 
6. Something not covered but still important. Is a farmer a business or not. As APMC states he is being compensated for inputs + labor not really profit, so is he not  a cost plus contractor in simple terms when selling at MSP or below. With this why is he not allowed to transfer GST to the buyer. Is he not loosing out because of this?
7. When will the body be set up the registration of buyers. Laws as dictated leave all counter party risk with the seller which is absurd and will lead to significant abuse as was the recent case in MP.
8. When will the farmers have access to meaningful financial tools so the maligned arhtiya looses complete relevance. Farmers cant get true lines of credit, loans etc. We need to give them access to financial instruments so they can modernize as required just like a business. 
9. What is the plan / investment to improve the supply chain from farm to consumer. The wastage happening after harvest is huge and no plans to contain it. This is a significant cause of inflation. The retailer is trying to recoup cost for total production with significantly less production being sold in the end. 
10. Crop insurance for certain crops can be provided to motivate farmers to switch from the current two crop rotation, dont know why this is not looked at all as a catalyst for change.
11. With no apmcs in existence how is the govt planning to capture agri. Data for volume and price. How is the govt., planning to control abuse and bad practices. 
12. What exactly was the problem with govt being the buyer of last resort. The govt intends to buy crops for pds, are they going to go buy from private buyers now and pay a commission and pay subsidy, kind of stupid is it not.
13. The legal recourse mechanisms provided are not sufficient, if we are talking contracts, should the farmer not have same access as businesses do.
14. What is the plan to weed out buyers of disrepute from the market. What is the plan to check if the buyer has the financial muscle to buy crops . In brief are they if not why not going to score buyers. 
15. What is stopping the buyers from making a cartel (oligopoly) from retailing at or close to max price  100% for perishable and 50% non perishable after signing a lower price multi year contract with farmers. How do they intend to control the delta in buying price of agri goods and retail price. If not managed, this will kill both the farmer and consumers.
16. How does the govt intend to keep a relatively stable price for farm produce when they have failed abjectly with msp in place. 
17. What is the minimum buyers required to constitute a fair market. How is it fair for a farmer to load and go look for a buyer not knowing what is out there. Hope there is understanding that farmers require multiple trips to transfer crops to local mandi, now with longer distance we are going to be delaying plantation for next crop theoretically.
18. When will a farmer know the tentative sale price of the non contract crops. As in the global markets and with msp will he continue to know price at sowing time so he can plant what market needs. If yes then how is govt ensuring procurement at msp or higher, when it came do so at present.
My concerns with these laws are that as designed they are open as sieves and will lead to more problems then solutions. Marginal farmers dont have a year or two for the system to run and get fixed while they absorb losses. 
As you mentioned all govt.s including current use farm subsidies as a vote generating tool, which needs to stop. Why not hold these laws in suspended animation for 6 months or longer while we revisit the complete agri. Supply chain and update it correctly. Honestly the issue is these laws are no better than bandages when what is required is a surgery to make agriculture competitive."

Only state governments have to make decisions over it, what the regime has done enacted tri farm laws is illegitimate and violation of constitution. Above all the regime had unilaterally setup new ministries for agriculture and education at centre. Till date centre did not had these ministries as constitution does allow it and does not reflect the setup of the nation. Both the departments are under the power of state governments. Are breaking the constitutional setup that is even above law.  So simply all those illegal laws does not control any and further comes under prosecution. Even if farmers struggle succeed this time why the regime has taken the agricultural ministry itself would say how much they are committed to demine the sector."

pm m,"A struggle for more utopia is always insatiable & unaffordable by the values of utopia themselves, but it will remain a perpetual struggle because it is fair looking unfairness.
This is as Yogendra puts a struggle by farmer landlords for 3 more D's in its ultimate: democracy to last person,  diversity to the extreme, and development of the least developed as seen by the 'revolutionaries' - who obviously  is not concerned  about their affected others, haven't regarded their internal diversity or degrees of inclusiveness, has least concern for the least developed - all these ideals require a dedicated sacrifice by all means for the ""other"" which is not there. Instead they make the rest of the nation to be the agent of their 3Ds! The rest of the nation should bear the cost of production, risk of market, 'listening' to their demand. Yogendraism, claims, if all claim themselves to be the last of 3Ds & fight with the representative who manage tgevresources and policies, then one day the utopia may come true. Only input for the utopia is sacrificing life at acute chill as collective 'revolutionary'. The ideals are so good, a cult fueled by them would run as a perpetual energy machine, 'intellectuals' would find it a dream cult. Yogendra is the super narrativist of the year. Let all from the last & least practice the utopian 3D from themselves too. Ultimate Diversity of total consultation till the last person becomes on par with the most  affluent.

Nitish Pandey,"Its shame that people of India only protest now when they want free stuff like protest for reservation and farm laws which are ending their free electricity, and water services without paying any tax and want gov. which they protest against to buy their food at a fixed price regardless of market price."
Jaison Kuriakose,"I have come across many comments saying the farmers are with luxury vehicles there for they are fake. 
Is it not allowed for a farmer to progress in his life with his hard work? Even after progressing in his life if he/she remains in the farming sector he/she is a real hero....
They need well recognition which will influence future generations to contribute lot in this field."
pm m,"This is NOT farmers' protest.
This is a struggle very much charecteristic of India, the India of diversity, in which every  sect, faith, caste, religion, class, region, identity, ideological claims,... is up in arms against the ""others"".
The fight against ""other"" is often made a holy Jihad, not merely by Islam, but from all sorts of identity claims.
 In India there is a huge - other, a boogie, made of all the others cannot be strictly classified as belonging to one religion that is the ""Hindu boogie"". That is an artificial enemy usually even 'intellectuals' take on! The colonial British took lot of effort  to construct such a intimate enemy for all Indians even for Hindus, as, caste matters ritually more than religion as it is actually absent. 
The othering of the  ""Hindu boogie""  is constructed along with other  narrative techniques such as labelling ""nationslism"" as 'jingoism', patriotism as 'fascism', self reliance as 'protectionism',  promoting anti-hindu-tva as progressive - egalitarian - liberal standpoint.  This was a ready made ideology carefully constructed & sown in indian minds by British Colonialists that strikes its cords even now. These protests,  including the CAA struggles were the aggressive outbursts tuned to its cacaphonic beats our 'intellectuals' ideologists, & journalists play. 
Diversity has lot of goodness, but it also comes with hatred for others. True intellectuals identify & help civilizations to get devenomed of toxic colonial mentality, but we as a third world do not have such organic intellectuals, but career academicians, who do everything in academics that helps them personally prosper. They just go along with the wind of academic bias. 
Not merely India has this problem, all nations had colonial past has this experience, interestingly the evertwhile still mudddle with the issues,...as we see BBC still carries its colonial agenda, and so are the western push in academics, so deceptively."

Passion Fruit,"1) These farmers disrupted a Patriotic Republic Day!
2) They were saying that police and army are their brothers! ""If one person in a family is a farmer another is in the police or army"", they said. Now they have attacked the police who were showing restraint. How come?
3) How come so called supporters from Canada, Germany, Italy.. where a number of Khalistanis live, actively funded by Pakistan's ISI, were barking their head off about matters they have no business to talk about? They are not even Indians! Maybe these farmers have one family member as a Khalistani & ISI agent also?
4) No other flag other than Indian National flag should be put on the Red Fort. And they put their religious flag also. This is an insult to the Nation! Next other communities will also wnt to hoist their flags on the Red Fort!
5) Mabe this raid on the Red Fort was supposed to be a trial run to attack the Parliament building on Budget Day?
6) How come farmers are in illeagal possession of tear gas guns? (See the picture is a leading national daily newspaper!). Where did he get it? How much did he pay & to whom? Who supplied it? Did it come from China or Pakistan?
7) One party's neta who talks the same things that Imran Khan does, doubts Indian Armed forces on Balakot and who has taken money from Xi Jing Ping for his NGO was actively supporting the frmers.
8) See Pakistani fake news propaganda that Indian Govt is against Sikhs! Not one opposition politician or farmer leader refuted this! 
9) Where is the money for  3 month long protests coming from? One neta recently went to Italy recently on a ""private visit"". Maybe MPs are not checked for the amount of cash they bring back?
10) One specific political party which never even supported our Police forces by giving them good weapons & bullet proof jackets, was high on supporting these rowdy farmers! Remember how during 26/11, Karkare died because of the bullet proof jackets did not even work? How much was paid for these jackets?
11) One specific political party which never even supported our Armed formed with good weapons is high on supporting rowdy farmers? Our IAF were still flying 40 year old planes when 15 year old scooters are scrapped! 
12) Another communist party leader is also supporting these rowdy farmers! In a communist country, farmers don't 'own' farmland! Read about how Mao Zedong, Lenin & Stalin simply nationalised every private property. Do communist party leaders in India own houses? Strange!
13) The farmers simply rejected every offer for a clause by clause threadbare discussion & were trying to dictate to the Govt! Their attitude was ""My way or Highway""! Clearly, they were never interested at all! Now that people are against them & they are fearing a backlash, they are saying ""violence never solved anything & they are ready for talks"". Get lost! The time for discussions is gone!"

new reach,"Reliance( Ambani murders) vs Farmer - A case study:
Reliance has 500 kg of rice ( 3rd law activated: unlimited hoarding ) .
It releases 50 kg at 50 Rs in supermarket. Farmer comes with 75kg rice to sell to reliance at 40 rs ( 1st law activated: sell to anyone above MSP ).
Reliance releases 50 kg more to show it has already 100 kg at 50 rs unsold stock ( manipulate supply)
Bargaining starts: Farmer is told to sell at 20 rs per kilo ( to recover transportation and living costs and to go back after paying skyrocketing fuel prices ).
Farmer now takes loan for daily expenses as season ends and thus debt grows at exorbitant rates. Remember reliance is watching all these. Being giant capital firm it squeezes a bank loan and launches Reliance scheme for mortgaging land to contract farming ( 2nd law acivated: Contract farming ).
Reliance being big firm will now store, launch various offers, mix, rename, grind and sell at different prices as no court will sue it ( only till SDM law activated).
Hence farmer loses crop produce, msp, apmc and even land if weak with these laws. India has majority > 80% of such small weak farmers who have zero bank support or price shock absorption. 
For this inequality and illegality to persist from Delhi Police till Sachin is bought by the capitalist govt."

So far farmers have been ignored by all governments and conditions are getting worse. Why should people have no say in democracy for laws passed for them and that too unconstitutionally ? In democracy, Supporters of the laws, needed to make their case before passing the law not afterwards. That is dictatorship. So learn your constitution first, for your rights as citizens and functioning of government in democracy. Now it is farmers, soon it can be you rights. Pay attention to what Ravish Kumar is reporting."
NEENA SINGH,"Government had been bringing down its gdp with loads of loans and Is selling everything to private corporates. Corrupt politicians and corporates are accumulating wealth and exploiting common people. When are they going to wake up? If disputing party farmers are not seeking any redress from Supreme Court, it has no jurisdiction to resolve the issue. Certainly it has no jurisdiction to retreat law, only government has.

Punjabi Class,"The three farm bills have created fear and unrest. The farmers are fully aware of the implications these bills will have and understand the long term effect it can have on their livelihood and dignity. 

Legal rights taken away: Every Indian will be affected by this bill, the most unjust imbalance of power. The law gives immunity to all civil servants, central and state governments, or any other person in respect of anything which is in good faith done or intended to be done under this act or of any rules or orders made hereunder. So, acceptance of the bill gives immunity to civil servants against legal action for crimes they have yet to commit 'in good faith'. Indian citizens will be excluded in right to legal recourse. It is very dangerous as it erodes the rights of every citizen.

Human rights: the treatment of the peaceful protestors has turned into a Human rights violation. The BJP government has refused to grant repeal to the laws. They are simply outlining their usefulness. Article 19 of Indian constitution states freedom of speech and expression. 

Dignity of farmers: farmers should be recognised by who they are and not what they give. Farmers can be dying to get out of contract arrangements where they're not given concrete leverage and can be left with little energy to diversify their production.

Capitalist: contract farming is capital accumulation and exploitation of the farming society. Contractors keep prices low to maximise profits. 1998 deregulated Indian sugar industry did not improve farmers' income. Pursuit of profit drives corporates more than notion of public interest or democracy. 

Contract farming: this should not be the only option. Contract companies are monoculture, reluctant to re-invest back into farming communities' rural interests. Sub-standard commodities can be rejected. Payments to farmers can be delayed. 

Food: food will be exported pushing locals to rely on imports. Natural seeds will be lost to manufactured products. Storage of crop will result in driving food prices up or down, at the mercy of the stakeholders. 

Legal contracts: contracts will be lengthy, costly litigation involved, lands will be leased long term and binding contracts will be difficult to exit. Agreements are designed so they do not allow farmers to break out of poverty cycle. 

Infrastructure: deregulated sugar industry did not improve infrastructure. Roads at risk of destruction by haulage trucks from urban areas.

Environment: soils can be degraded, chemicals and excessive use of fertilisers all have negative footprint in a market driven crop. 

MSP: the new bills clearly state that MSP is not part of law. 

Recommended resolution: Empowering farmers to lead by experimentation, build consensus and make choices rather than embracing contract farming as the only option. Farmers can yield trust-worthy results by understanding problems from all prospectives. Explore broader ranges and allow leads to more innovative solutions that address underlying factors."

If the cops have any love for their job and this nation, and if they have any sense of duty and conscience, they should stand with the people of this country and their JUST DEMANDS and CAUSE rather than behaving like robots, acting as the tools in the hands of people that are trying to destroy this nation, including them and their families as well.

And since there was no social media at that time, the public was successfully fooled by the government (Congress at the time). BJP is the same as Congress. Remember that in the next elections people. Vote for someone different than these two if you really want to see change.

Sonny Sandhu,"As an academic/professional/Judges/journalist/writer/speaker, who writes/speaks forcibly (without fact/truth or poetic mood), writes/speaks, amoral/factious, just for the sake of fame/glory/money. S/he who restricts the TRUTH by killing emotions. S/he cannot be an academic/professional/Judge/journalist/writer/speaker in the TRUE spiritual spirit of TRUTH.
Those people who comes to your, and vice versa you at their door (threshold), but does not demand anything. Who treats you with respect even though you tease them (disparage with your language/article). And if you look beyond your naked eye, you would find them to be a TRUE-Worshipper, worshipper of the Almighty CREATOR, and not just a Beggar.
People who believes in the TRUTH conscious and orientatedTeacher/Guru, they who work hard in their respective professions. Even if they are defeated, they still win in the end and get emancipated/liberated, NO decree (allegation) is applicable to them.
As any academic/professional/Judges/journalists/writers/speakers who fails to uphold academic integrity and indirectly brought disrepute to their profession. Has committed a deplorable slander SIN.One needs to speak out against INJUSTICE & LIES. By being mere spectator, allow multifaceted Lies to conceive and born. So, SPEAK OUT, in order Justice & TRUTH Prevails. 
Academic Integrity defines academic integrity as a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to 7 fundamental values:fairness, honesty, integrity, respect, responsibility, trust, and virtue. From these values flow principles of behavior that enable academics/professionals communities, to translate ideals to action. The Fundamental Values of Academic Integrity describes these core values in detail. And out of many key quotes that contribute to the foundation of Academic Integrity's core beliefs are as following:
Fairness: -Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.-- Martin Luther King, Jr.
Honesty:- One word of truth outweighs the whole world.-- Alexander Solzhenitsyn
Integrity: -Be daring, be different, be impractical; be anything that will assert integrity of purpose and imaginative vision against the play--it--safers, the creatures of the commonplace, the slaves of the ordinary.-- Cecil Beaton
Responsibility: -The willingness to accept responsibility for one's own life is the source from which self-respect springs.-- Joan Didion
Respect: -Let every man/person be respected as an individual and no man/person idolized. -- Albert Einstein
Trustworthiness: -Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none. - - William Shakespeare 
Virtue:- Wealth is a weak anchor, and glory cannot support any person, this Law of Land & Creator, ONLY Virtues are Firm and cannot be shaken by any tempest.-- Swami Vivekananda
If one reads the aforementioned 7 values,and 8th is the COURAGE, plus more coexisting TRUTH propounding and compatible moral ethical values of treasure trove recorded in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib(SGGS).Only principles of TRUTH with courage is propounded in SGGS, and teaching contains 1430Angs(limbs), containing 5,894 hymns of 36 saint mystics which includes Sikh teacher/guru sahiban 6 (teacher),Bhagats/Saints15 (Hindu/Muslim),Bhatts 11 (learned Bhramins whose teaching actions were based on Righteous/Truthful) andgursikhs 4(Sikh baptised desciple). It is notable among ONLY foundational Faith scripture for including hymns from writers who PRACTICED other Faiths.Courageously, Fairness, Honestly, Integrity, Respect, Responsibility, Trust & Virtue, namely Hindus and Muslims and not deprive/denied their rights by referencing their names wherever their teachings appears/recorded. Though Guru Granth Sahib is written in theGurmukhi(Truth uttered from teacher/guru, ones own mouth) script, its pronunciation is authentic in various languages, includingLahnda(Western Punjabi),Braj Bhasha,Kauravi,Sanskrit,Sindhi, andPersian. Copies in these languages often have the generic title ofSant Bhasha. SGGS propounds message (by preceptors regardless of casteism/faiths) of acceptance, diversity, equality & inclusivity. SGGS fundamental creed: He(Creator) is the Sole Supreme Being; of eternal manifestation;
Creator, Immanent Reality; Without Fear;
Without Rancour; Timeless Form; Unincarnated;
Self-Existent; Realized by grace of the holy Preceptor. 
Regardless of one's Faith, s/he who has conscious conscience, and Courageously propound principles of Truth and practice Righteousness, are the ones who are known as HUMANE. Only such person can bring principles and ideal of TRUTH & Righteousness to maturity whereverthey are present can be experienced. So, that Humanity can blossom, flourish, justice and Truth prevails.

In any situation, the current government should be held responsible be it the 26th Jan incident( it was government failure) or the ongoing current protest. They have intelligence, Police, and whatnot.

Baljeet Kaur,"The State of Panjab needs protection, as well as other states who are protesting right now....they need support to grow its economy, industry, to clean environment, ecology, employment, right wage, housing, clean water,  just to mention few, also, income that not only support their day to day life but have surplus to buy food that is nutritious!!!!!! etc..
There are some MPs who are working hard to name one,,,    Recently, Bhagwant Maan brought out some of the fruad out in the open and held a meeting with the press, in which he brought peoples letters and bills showing,  that the government gave the city of Dehli free electricity, but Panjab they were charging people 3,000 and above ruppees...........also, Bhagwant Maan visited villages where the electric board had cut off electricity.....Bhagwant Maan also caught traffic officers blocking people and asking for bribes...in one village the bridge had broken in half a year ago and the officer in charge done nothing......knowing that children used the bridge to pass over and everyday people to carry out their daily life......
....................these officers and angecies in charge should not get away with this kind of crime, felony, atrocities, damage to the country's people and mismanagement......

there is so much talk about CM of Panjab being threatened and many more who wants to do something about the problems created by the government and the government is frightening them and their  officials and employees
When the people are being threatened by the government, people need to have recorded evidence and expose the government.  or ask the government to put it in writing.......whatever the action need to be taken rather than verbal, so that it caan be evidence from which person it came from........this is one of the way to eradicate corruption....also, the courts need to protect the vulnerable .... the judicial law has to step in and apply the law.....to save india; India is becoming a mockery in the world..................................because there is no intelligent system.
I say, to those, stop making lot of noise in rajya sabha and lok sabha and do some real work...discuss the work not done but was promised.  ask repeatedly and don't get tired of it...................and those who are not doing their work....remind them, when you get hired,,,its all about the performance........and not just about the seat and looking good and sitting pretty......do some work for a change, you get paid for it.................if you don't tHAT MONEY WILL BE TAKEN OFF YOU AND GIVEN TO THE POOR.............................DO YOU KNOW THAT SYSTEM..............?
we want  MPs and related officials, who suppose to be looking after the citizens of the country, to work hard and not just get paid for coming to the office................
the phenomena is being seen over and over agian, where many MPs  being interviewed by TV , and REPORTERS, where the interviewer consistently asked them, what have you done for the people?????these many MP's had nothing much to say.....Because the question was you have been in government for few years, what have you done?
 we are still waiting for you and your agency to do something.  People are tired of false promises.......

I say, .Let these MPs have  a warning, to be not inactive, MPs who are full of talk but no action.....and no realism, or argument to solve issues, neither challenging the structure, function, transaction or the false behaviour and irrational mentality of leaders of the country .........................instead, they take the attention away from them and try o create false agenda....

Let me ask you a question, when you are hired there is description of the role you are hired for, if you can't do the job.....don't take the job.....
You must have understood that the performance is needed in a job.....not silly arguments to make yourself look good that you can talk....talk is cheap......
additionally,  there are lot of MPs taking pictures with their colleagues in a higher position and smiling, how can you sleep at night when people who are of your parents age are sleeping ruff on the streets
..I say shame on you,, what are you proud of......having a seat means nothing, you lot are a burden to the society.
and so does the whole of Rajya Sabha, Lok Sabha, State CMs, Amit Shah, and agencies as such and those who are gone deaf and dumb and blind.......mindless.."
Baljeet Kaur,"1.  there should be discussions on saving Sikh life, the minority, 2% of Sikh people in India, who are busy feeding and looking after rest of India and in return, no acknowledgement or development of state of panjab, nor caring for its stability, no problem solving, no productive change, and no real political sense or order operating in the state of panjab for their security, well-being, projects of employment, or other means of income  or resource.  I let and encourage people of other states to raise their voice too, its not one man/woman war}.
2...Discuss the growth of diversity, and give analysis, of the discipline of politics, method of politics, investigate the the gatekeepers of the political world, challenging, by using agencies from abroad.  There are plenty who have links and expose bad running of the political system. Get together elected representatives and make them talk......when they get phone calls of bribes and asking them to move over to their parties, ask them put it in writing and record their conversation also as proof of evidence....
the public is the judge, judge the institution and their wisdom.  bribery is nothing to laugh, but people have in the past,  that's why things have got so worse now      ....know this  people, bribery is a felony and unlawful, report and here should be FIR against these people and not against innocent farmers...
3...ask why modi is bringing back master and slave culture.  Its old hindu system function, why modi is walking backward, it did not work then.  It will not work in this contemporary,  modern and educated world!!!!!"

mshoora 1312,"I am still not clear about the issues involved in the Farmer's agitation. So, I asked a friend of mine, who besides engineering is a farmer from Abohar - Fazilka region of Punjab. Now, after retirement he is a full time farmer.

This is what he told me.
""I have been actively farming for almost two decades now and I have witnessed many things happen at APMCs.

I have seen classifications of C grade grain miraculously change into B grade grain.

Similarly I have also witnessed the weigh bridge weigh in the empty truck at 39 tons and the full truck at 55 tons and later found that the unloaded truck weighed 43 tons at another weigh bridge.

Yes I know, you know what I know. Yet, let me tell you more about what you may already know.

There are over 30,000 registered adtiyas in Punjab.

These 30,000 employ another 300,000 sub agents or sidekicks or people who wouldnt have made it into doing anything anyplace were it not for the patronage network of these 30,000.

There are only 1500 farming villages in Punjab.

330,000 / 1500 is about 220 people on average per village doing the work of middlemen.

Why is this the case?

Its a long story but someone needs to begin talking about this at some time.

We had a food shortage and a ship to mouth existence until the 1970s.

Norman Borlaugh pioneered a variety of wheat which gave 10 X the yield but needed 3X the fertiliser.

The Punjab was chosen as the battleground against hunger. Enterprising Sikh farmers worked hard to Create what we know as the green revolution.

Since there were huge shortages. Laws were made which didnt allow for stockholding or selling at farm gates.

Essential Commodities Act
APMC Act (farmers were compelled to sell only at APMCs to licensed traders - remember license permit quota Raj?)

As an assurance to the farmer for his hard work. Minimum Support Prices were guaranteed.

No matter what the quantum. Sarkar would pick it up and provide farmers with a minimum amount as compensation per quintal or ton as the case maybe.

Getting money out of the sarkari treasury is a muck filled process. Thus was born the breed of middle men who walked the corridors of bureaucracy, government and worked corrupt sarkari babus.

political patronage networks flourished.

 220 : 1 is the ratio of middlemen to a single village in Punjab today.

This business got integrated backwards.

Corruption was professionalised.

For instance, I have in my circle of influence or immediate family, folks who own very large tracts of land. (100 acre plus holding).

The thekedar comes and takes the theka of growing on the land. For those unfamiliar with the word, Theka its also referred to as contract. I know there are grumblings about corporates contracting with farmers directly now. I also know why. You should too.

Anyways; to cut a long story short.
Plenty Farmers do, not much except receive their due at the end of each cropping season.

What is grown?
What grade or quality?
For how much is it sold?
Would it have fetched the similar price in the open market?
Where is it sold?
How is it sold?
Whos the end beneficiary?
Does anybody consume it or does it go to waste?
Was there a better way to do whats being done?

All the above is none of my business or yours.

As long as you receive your cheque.
Why do you care?

The Jamkhedkar committee meanwhile reports that over 40% of the grain acquired under MSP by FCI is either unfit for consumption or is simply wasted.

All Told, One out of every Two kilos acquired is wasted.

Years of perfidy have today given birth to this.

MSP has ensured that there is no necessity to seek profitable enterprise.

Its also given birth to the patronage networks which survive off the sarkari teat and refuse to breakaway.

Its given rise to a political class which thrives and survives of being Specialist Corrupt Thugs.

There was no sunset clause on this. Nobody foresaw a time of surplus production on food grains.

Result; all other states such as Haryana, UP, Bihar, Rajasthan & MP all produce surfeits of Grain. They also have their own MSP mechanisms which have proliferated and created similar political patronage networks.

Since more is acquired at Mandis in Punjab. Remember the central government promise. Grain from UP and or Bihar also finds its ways into the mandi system of Punjab.

The trucks being under weight and over paid for and the grades changing are common place practise, you can go for a few days to the mandi and figure out how to make a killing by doing this. I dont advise it, this is what the system is current day. I advise, Try doing truthful clean work. Its more fulfilling.

Soon enough, youll also be one of those know it alls in the mandi who doesnt talk to others. After all information is power.

All this is paid for by you dear tax payer.

The annual bill for this is approximately 8 lakh crores.

Why dont the farmers grow something else.
Something more profitable.

If Im being paid for doing precisely nothing.

Why bother with competing.

Where is the incentive to compete?

I would rather go and picket the roads leading into Delhi to ensure that the existing system isnt threatened.""

3. Corporate companies can stock their materials to any limit legal which is major cause food crisis and price rise. This is law under which corporate are going to control Indian markets according to them selves legally.
3 . Modi is saying it's going to be 1 nation 1 market. It already 1 market we can sell our crops anywhere in india legally before this.

Why only PUNJAB farmers are getting TRAPPED in LIES and fabricated FEARS. How they know it is not good? Why farmers of rest of India have started benefiting from this law. Give atleast 1-2 years to see how effective or ineffective it is? Right now, just blind assumptions presumptions illusions and misinformation by opposition and Pseduo secular urban naxals, nothing else. Govt already in talks but see ARROGANCE no we dont want AMENDMENTS but only REPEAL? This law is introduced after weeks of discussion in Parliament and those who are opposing now were supporting this? Why? UPA congress has it in their manifesto and their leaders endorsed this in Parliament during their term. Now U-Turn? Meaning theyre eyeing Punjab elections in 2022  as their middlemen (they are RICH with their kids settled abroad) vote bank and money funding to state govt with lot of taxes etc that will get HIT and Farmers will directly get BENEFIT.

Something is just not right !!! Anybody in their right sense can understand these laws are going to benefit the farmers across india.

And if he loves to have credit then why doesnt discredit?? If he has done so much for this country , then why he has not taken a single question in an open press conference in last 6 years ?

Juhi Chawla,There are so many anti-India forces acting against the current regime. They jump at every opportunity to malign the governments image. Policies need to be discussed in all regional languages so that farmers know that their interests are being taken care of and what they lose or gain in the bargain.The conspirators need to be exposed but at the same time people have to be reassured.
The Hindu Boi,Akali Politcians and the Haryanvi Politicians have misguided these farmers and all are coordinated by the same Khangress . They might be those Commission Agents or the stooges of Khangress paid by George Soros .
Juhi Chawla,A debate on similar models adopted in different countries and the impact on the living standards is needed. Every time India experiments we have seen naysayers. Same thing happened when we decided to get our share in the global economy. Our living standard improved and economists resented the late entry.
Juhi Chawla,"Government should tell the farmers that if their income doesnt increase in a timeframe, therell be an option to go back to older ways. Politics should not stop experiments specially if farmer suicides has been an issue which dates back to Congress days. Karz ka dher and karza maafi is not an option. The farmers should be reassured and taken in confidence so that these politically motivated protesters get exposed."
Ratandeep Kaur Sodhi,"Those who are saying against of farmers they  first should know about the bill . 
Its all a bloody play played for looting farmers and countrys people money .

Remember when ECI can be charged for murder of people under criminal law by a stupid temarks of a HC and SC asking ECI to take it in correct spirit. Let the judges of SC by allowing protest from anarchists is also equally guilty. In the cell inject coro a to yogendra and other anarchists who are acting for pharma lobby and Chinese spies in India.

The Politics of BJP RSS Parties which seek to infiltrate Religion openly and caste indirectly into politics to gain Political Power and to destroy Humanity Human Equality Humane, will never win. 
Only Humane will win. 
Who is responsible for the disgraceful condition of today's 74 year old independent India which denigrates two different graveyards two different dwellings and fellow Human Beings in the name of Caste?
DK? DMK? ADMK? Congress? Communists?
Will the DK DMK ADMK Congress and Communists now take responsibility for the disgrace of today's India and take appropriate action?
The world Communists without properly manipulating Karl Marx's ideology of Equality, the best in the world, have been rejected by the people and left in a state of irreversibility as they have fragmented Humanity without reconsidering the theory of ""Proletarian Dictatorship "" which is revised by Karl Marx. 
With positive Politics for the people as a whole, we will create a new world of Education Work Health Equality Peace Happiness and Harmony with Nature for all.

santosh kumar,"Farmers carry seeds and fertilizer . Farmers don't carry Swords, Iron rods, Stones . Only rioters and hooligans carry Swords, 
Iron rods, Stones .

1. The three farm bills are already in place and working fine as of now 
and they are part of congress , bjp, ncf parties 2019 election manifesto.
ex farmer minister of ncp and present congress chief minister of punjab also 
supported the same reforms in the past. Now all oppositon parties change their stand and making farmers scape goat.

2. post dialogue with farmers and govt ,On december 9th clarified with 10 point 
amendment
 that all the doubts farmers posed and will be tabled in next session of
 parliament. But protesting farmers unions change stand after dec 9th 
and want full repeal.

3.  In 2019 farmers can't sell their 
produced rice/wheat/vegetables etc out side of the district or county 
and cant sell to any one outside of the APMC market yards/mandis and 
farmer has to pay 8.5 percent fees( 3% to market yard improvement, 3% to
 district development , 2.5% to licensed commision agents). In some 
markets they collect both  from seller and buyer each 8.5% . These new 
2020 farm laws allows farmers to sell  to any where in india to any one .
 no restriction. It is upto local government to  charge needed cess or 
fees.

4. In 2019 only 10% of total agriculture produce (mainly 
wheat and rice)was bought by government agency FCI (Food Corporation of 
India as a stockpile for emergeny security) . 85% was purchased by 
private buyers . In 2019 only 15% of produce of total agriculture was 
purchased at minimum support price (MSP) and rest was purchased at lower
 price. Till 2010 the minimum support price was lower than the 
international price of the goods. After 2010 the minimum support price 
was increased higher than international price and no exporter is
buying at msp except govt agency and all godowns of FCI agency are full with 4.5 trillion tonnes of wheat and rice .

5. who is at loss due to this farm bills of 2020 are 


   A. punjab state governments who charge 3% cess for district 
developement will loose around 15000 millions  (1500 crores) indian 
rupees per year income.  

   B. the punjab licensed commision agents (who are mainly punjabi sikh jat caste landlords )who get 2.5% 
charge  per transaction thro markets will loose 1000 crores (10000 
million) rupees per year only in punjab state.

   c. Other than punjab and haryana no other state charge district fees and market cess 
and they charge only commision agent fees. Some states there are no 
markets/mandis like in kerala (since 1980) and bihar (since 2008).

6.  The funding for protest is happening by charging 500 rupees per farmer .
 80% farmers own only less than 2 hectres /5 acre land.

7. The foreign punjab seperatist/secissionist group sikh for justice announced 1
 millon dollars as donation and indian banks stoped the 
   distribution asking account holder to show FCRA ( Foreign control regulatory) registrants for permission

8. All want farm reforms. Punjab and Haryana farmers unions want to repeal
 and rest of indian country farmers  are happy that they can sell 
anywhere. I think if central/union govt gives that 1500 crores to punjab
 govt per year and 1000 crore to punjab commision agents it will stop.
 
9. In 2021 january govt gave a option to protesting farmers union that it will hold the laws till 2 years until 
 joint committe of farmers and govt will finalize the law clauses that will benefit farmers or not. But unions are adament.
 
10. On jan 26,2021 farmers unions done tractor rally and in that lot of Iron rods, Swords carrying rioters injured 200 police men 
of delhi police and some of them in ICU. Delhi police not used single bullet and took the beating from iron rods of rioters.

11. Delhi police booked 300 rioters based on jan 26 2021 cctv camera footage and upon delhi court order. But on 6th feb 2021 farmers unions
done chakkajam (round up of delhi) with lot of demands along with item 3 demand of letter( submitted to delhi police) that the 
delhi police should release all 300 rioters who took them in custody based on court order for jan 26 violence.

12. On Feb 2021, Supreme court of india created an farmers expert committe of experts to listen to greviances but farmers unions
boycotted them . 

13. On April 2021, Indian central government said that they will pay the purchased price of rice and wheat by food coorporation of
india to the farmers directly to their bank account which punjab state farmers unions are opposed it because lot of the food grains
purchased by fci in punjab are not grown in punjab instead they bought from other states and sold to fci by middle men by forming account
ring to get more commission."

In line with the judgement of Madras HC which said ECI is criminally responsible for pandemic, we can attribute the same charge against SC. It should have banned the protest. There is a clear understanding between judiciary  opposition and farmers otherwise why not the judge who took suo moto case for vaccine issue it is a mute spectator on this issue. Very shame on them. Judiciary at its worst now a days not doing it's work of clearing backlogs but allowing protests etc even during pandemic is unheard of. It is not taking up vaccine sold by a state for profit suomoto, it is not taking up vaccine wastage by Rajasthan why there is a clear nexus which is what it strikes me. Foreign lobby playing through all forums."

The Politics of BJP RSS Parties which seek to infiltrate Religion openly and caste indirectly into politics to gain Political Power and to destroy Humanity Human Equality Humane, will never win. 
Only Humane will win. 
Who is responsible for the disgraceful condition of today's 74 year old independent India which denigrates two different graveyards two different dwellings and fellow Human Beings in the name of Caste?
DK? DMK? ADMK? Congress? Communists?
Will the DK DMK ADMK Congress and Communists now take responsibility for the disgrace of today's India and take appropriate action?
The world Communists without properly manipulating Karl Marx's ideology of Equality, the best in the world, have been rejected by the people and left in a state of irreversibility as they have fragmented Humanity without reconsidering the theory of ""Proletarian Dictatorship "" which is revised by Karl Marx. 
With positive Politics for the people as a whole, we will create a new world of Education Work Health Equality Peace Happiness and Harmony with Nature for all.

Question 2-- we have seen police using tear gas and water cannons before during the clash between police and farmers and no one is wearing masks but now they did with khalistani flags and you guys are believing idiotically, they are punjabis and that too i know there would atleast one person serving indian army for every house hold 

I feel like it's some kind of game some bastard is playing to dissolve the credibility of farmers, and I am not saying I am true just question the possibility anything of your choice before you believe something"

Let me give you a light on it...
Actually current government has passed three laws on farming in India...
Which allows the farmers to directly sale they produce to the whoever they want...

And there used to be the minimum support price before this law... Opposition is saying that govt will remove the minimum support price and will not be good for farmers..

So Government have officially confirmed to the  nation that there will be the minimum support price and it will not be removed... In fact since 2014, government has bought more food from farmers to support them then the earlier government...

And government is ready to amend the laws also... For whatever the dispute farmers have abt the law , but opposition and farmer leaders  are instigating farmers to take the whole laws back....infact supreme court have said to put stay on law for a year ....BUT farmers just wants to remove the whole law...
 
And the irony is once a while opposition had mentioned to brig these law in their menifesto...and now they themselves are opposing it..

There are many more farmers in India then  these protesters who support to the law
Here are just a few of the farmersthat are not less in  number but as compared to the overall number of farmers in India these are few farmers from all over India...
It's totally Acceptable if farmers do protest for something if they don't like about government...
But some opposition leader and khalistani motivated group is running the whole scenario..."

But they hid the fact that they had taken away the cctv from the premises where the shots were fired from. That footage is still missing. Even the post mortem doctor told the relatives of the farmer that the injuries were consistent with bullet wounds. .. but that they couldnt put their findings in writing and on record for obvious reasons.

Shantha George,The farmers received permission from Delhi to conduct the tractor rally on 26-1-2021. Today on Republic Day the farmers conducted a peaceful march. But Modi Sarkar like a fox lied and cheated them by tear-gassing and flatenning the tyres of the tractors. The farmer's reaction is noteworthy here. They left peacefully. Modi is acting dangerously proud and arrogant. Nobody is going to give up till Modi Sarkar vanishes like smoke.

Why don't people care for the policies BJP government is making to kill the income of poor. Well at first majority don't understand the policies. There is a common thinking that men is suit can do any wrong with their pen and still people won't understand but when a poor person do something visible than it becomes the only crime commited

Protest in every country could be different in meaning, for peculiar reasons. 

Negative protests:- Sometimes foreign oligarchy governments meddle in another country with the help of sold out media they provoke people and create a useless protest to try to remove the sovereignty of that country and a strong leadership.

Positive protests:- sometimes native people Organically do it against the oligarchy puppet government to preserve some sovereignty.

This protest is Organically done by the people of India against the puppet government which rules India"
Jude MelRoses,"'Tractor Rally' 
 Followed by the Wagon rally."
harjinder singh,No farmers no food
Razzi Warraich,"There was no disrespect done to our National flag on the Republic Day. The Nishan Sahib that was raised on the Laal Killa is the same flag that was raised on the Laal Killa 18 times in history against the Mughal Rule by the Sikhs who stood up against oppression towards Hindus and fought against the forceful mass conversion of Hindus to Islam.

 We should not forget the our history of 800 years of Mughal rule in India and the Khalsa armys formation to stand up against the oppression of other religions in India. Khalsa army stood up against Mughals snd closed the  Dariyaye khaibar the passage from Afghanistan where these looters used to come from. 

Under this Khalsa flag, the Sikhs  not only protected the Hindu women during the Mughal rule, but also sacrificed their lives for the existence of the Hindu faith in India. 

This Khalsa flag is also raised in the gurudwaras that provide free food to the needy without discrimination. Khalsa flag is also the flag of the Sikh Regiment in the army. 

This false propaganda that is being spread to defame the Farmers protest and the Sikh community is a shameless act by the Right wing RSS. Sikh community brings the whole nation together as one, but RSS divides our country in the name of religion. 

By preplanning and staging the violence on the Republic Day, this fascist government thought that they would be able to create a drift among people and spread hatred in the name of religion. But they forgot that they are trying to fool the educated people if India, people who understand the cheap tactics of this government. And the truth came out when the person luring the protests towards the Laal Killa came out to a BJP supporter. His pictures are on social media with the PM and the Home Minister Amit Shah in a conference room. The question to ask is, who can have access to the PMs conference room? Did anyone ask the PM to clarify his stand with Deep Sidhu? 

All this preplanned false propaganda was exposed, when people found out about the relationship of Deep Sidhu & BJP. This protest is stronger than ever now.BJP has failed every single protest , crushed every single voice that was raise against them through the false reporting of Godi media and by creating a false narrative. BJPs IT cell works tirelessly day and night by creating the false Twitter account and spreading fake news, just like the TRP scam by many renowned TV channels. 

People understand your propaganda now & you cant spread hatred by using false narrative. We stand in solidarity with our farmers and their rights. #farmersprotest"

Ishpreet Kaur,"What happened that day is an expression of dissent by the farmers who have been peacefully protesting for 2 months and losing their loved ones amid cold and covid. Almost 150+ farmers died in the protest. The government passed the laws amid covid and declared postponing it just days prior to Republic Day for their reputation. They care less for the farmers and more about their image. Police clearly fired unprovoked tear gases to the peaceful protestors and the whole mess began. Thats a ground report ! Protestors were seen distributing water bottles to police and protecting female police from the chaos. Yes they hoisted their Sikh faith flag but whats wrong with that? The National flag was way up higher and untouched and the Sikh faith flag is a reminder of the dissent of farmers who have heard zero response from their democratic prime minister about the farm law protests since day 1 as if pretending the country is well and stablilised. Guess what? The government stopped/slowed Internet services in the capital to prevent the authenticity of the day get out! 


I would request everyone to check @sikhexpo page on Instagram. They have the ground reports and tell the whole truth. The media twisted the narrative as always. Trust me, as always."

Centre government told in the three farm laws in farmers( empowerment and protection) act chapter 2 part 7 sub part (2) they said that there will be no limitation on storage  will be applicable which will act as a other way of black hoarding. 
Another fear of farmers is chapter 3 part 14 where they Gave power only to SDM and farmers are well aware about Pepsi potato case so they are against it
Other point is chapter 4 part 19 they restrained the entrance of civil court
Chapter 2 part 10 sub part 1 aggregator ka role same hai jaise middlemen ka to yeh log jo bol rahe hain ki middlemen aur Dalaal protest kr rahe hain wo Galt hai"

To all those commenting the at these aren't farmers and they are disrespecting the ""indian"" flag,
Tell me an instance where the central government treated us indians! 
When our (Tamil) farmers protested there - they were indifferent.
When our fishermen were fired, they still called Sri Lanka, a friendly nation.

Now when Sikhs as you say are disrespecting the indian flag, I find no offence  when you feel that they shouldn't have did it, why the hell didn't the indian government take efforts to look into their demands???????

My doubts
1. Who gave the permission to rally, as govt. trying from day 1 that the groups includes anti social elements 
2. How come your traffic rules on rally known to each farmers
3. When govt. Is so Innocent , why would they deploy huge police force and arms to control( they knew it before then) when they give rally permission
4. Why UK PM john borrison not visited to celebrations quoting covid to escape. As they alert from their security personnel 
5. What finally the rally achieved apart from hosting a flag, blaming themselves as anti social elements and crediting to govt.
6. Did they killed anyone (police/people), on the streets to Red fort
7. If this was done by bjp at ayodhya , SC gave a clean chit disposing off the case as there is no substantive evidence to prove. Did these farmers destroyed any historical monuments of unity as they were anti national elements.
My expectations to take place in next few days
1. Threatening to file cases based on their footage and harassing individually to vacate the place.
2. Arrest the union leaders and suppress the protest by lack of leadership
3. Getting the fame that govt. lost during the protest. 
Finally..... These kind of incidents are new to farmers but not bJP led india govt. As they came into existence in political by riots.
I'm an Indian and proud to be. I love my Constitution.Im an Hindu and proud to be until my last breath

Punjabi Studio,"By responding to the January 26 incident, the farmer leaders have proved that they are weak leaders. They are bent on proving their own people wrong and slandering them. The fact is that they are not able to bear the weight of this struggle and that is why they are making such statements against Deep Sidhu and other Singhs. The flag has been hoisted, no one has committed murder. This all happens in big struggles, our farmer leaders should ask the government how police fired on our people. 200 farmers have been martyred in the last 60 days. Have we come to kill our people in this cold? 
They are showing their Ram Mandir in the official parade on January 26 and our people are behind Deep Sidhu just for a flag. We should ask to the government if India is a secular country then in the official parade how the government brought Ram Mandir (which Was a disputed place). So, I request you all to support each other and not get muddy on each other. Our Singhs has done what the people of a free nation do."
W Kaur,Its sad  it happened . kisan tried at their level best to keep it in peace but some stupid people didnt listened to their leaders. It would be good to keep tringa  over there.
Jas Sandhu,"Whenever a state sees a threat from a mass secular movement then the simple, clever, and very persuasive strategy is to infiltrate fake radicalism to misguide some and break the unity. The democratic process was building pressure on the government to repeal the economic policy impacting the farmers of India, Lal Kila incident was well planned by the agency to divide people and derail this mass movement. However, people with common sense very well understand nothing can divide Indian farmers and deviate them from the resolve to repeal the laws."

kindly talk/ behave to media very patiently, gently, kindly and meaningfully with maturity and relates what they ask you. Not convey meaningless messsge unnessary talk. they are here for your support to dictate/convey your message to rest of country and to Govt also.
Relates to your agricultural problems only.
this is the time not to involve in other topics. Discuss only your agricultural related bills only. Don't talk about punjabi farmers only. Rest of country's farmers are also with you and for yours support for common cause.
 *Kindly don't involve in other topics.* Your's other topics discussion apart of Agricultural bills are continuously highlighting on every channel and *KISSAN ANDOLAN* will loose impact.
All you have work very hard.
Your's single unnecessary talk can pay you very heavily.
Talk with possitive attitude only. Don""t chant the slogans murdabad murdabad. Don't waste your energy. Keep store with you. This will help you lateron.

Most Importantly
STAY TOGETHER

You're getting support from everyone. 
Talk of everyone.

Farther and son fight with each other?"
anon11,"farmers by profession, Warriors by blood. This is all happening because Modi in truly Undemocratic fashion forced the farm bills on the people of India, hes expecting the people to adhere to the new changes even though they do NOT want it , the people of India have seen private takeover of certain economic sectors and have strongly opposed it. Modi and his government are fools with enlarged egos, they severely lack any skill when it comes to digressing socioeconomic and political issues before deciding an complete transgression of reform. Another issue why this largely effects the Sikh community is because Punjab is almost entirely an agricultural state with the majority living in it being Sikhs of course and Punjab is the homeland of Sikhs. The cultural and religious tie of Sikhs with Punjab heavily correlates to sovereignty or ownership of the state affairs in Punjab. Its an extremely long discussion with many socio factors to consider but BJP supporters have so much conviction in PM Modi that if the media blindly labels Sikhs as Khalistanis they will support it without any forethought and objectivity."

vijay aulakh,"Dhruv brother you are unaware of true facts. Initially all farmer union leaders decided to perform tractor parade on ring road but later due to unkown reasons they changed their decision on midnight of 25th january to march on route given by delhi police. This created confusion and anger among all protestors. Therefore people decided to march on initial route against the permission of delhi police. From this you can understand that deep sidhu and lakha sidhana weren't responsible for any action but the union leaders are truly responsible. Coming towards the red fort topic, is it an offense to raise farmer's flag and nishan sahib on empty pole where there was no tricolor at all? Is it legal in our constitution for RSS to raise their flag on red fort? Rules must be same for everyone. Moreover if you say that red fort is highly prestigious and respected site of india then is it okay for our PM to sell this public property to dalmia bharat group for span of 5 years in exchange of money? Mr Rathee, you can't prove farmers guilty and justify others without stating true facts.

FARMER'S EXPLOITATION
  Who is exploiting the farmers? It is the wholesale dealers, stockists , in grains markets, anaj mandis and Subzi mandis. who exploit the farmers. When the crop is harvested and Farmers bring it to Market to sell, these wholesale dealers make a CARTEL and make the rates fall down and buy from the Farmers at low price. When the farmers have sold it and it is the stockists who are to sell food grains this cartel increases the rates  MSP AS A LAW IS NEEDED TO PREVENT CARTELISATION. It will not affect the Government budget . MSP will protect the farmers from this CARTEL. It will be an antidote of CARTEL."

Gagan K,"This isn't a khalistani flag, first go educate yourself instead of barking like modi dogs."
Razzi Warraich,"There was no disrespect done to our National flag on the Republic Day. The Nishan Sahib that was raised on the Laal Killa is the same flag that was raised on the Laal Killa 18 times in history against the Mughal Rule by the Sikhs who stood up against oppression towards Hindus and fought against the forceful mass conversion of Hindus to Islam.

 We should not forget the our history of 800 years of Mughal rule in India and the Khalsa armys formation to stand up against the oppression of other religions in India. Khalsa army stood up against Mughals snd closed the  Dariyaye khaibar the passage from Afghanistan where these looters used to come from. 

Under this Khalsa flag, the Sikhs  not only protected the Hindu women during the Mughal rule, but also sacrificed their lives for the existence of the Hindu faith in India. 

This Khalsa flag is also raised in the gurudwaras that provide free food to the needy without discrimination. Khalsa flag is also the flag of the Sikh Regiment in the army. 

This false propaganda that is being spread to defame the Farmers protest and the Sikh community is a shameless act by the Right wing RSS. Sikh community brings the whole nation together as one, but RSS divides our country in the name of religion. 

By preplanning and staging the violence on the Republic Day, this fascist government thought that they would be able to create a drift among people and spread hatred in the name of religion. But they forgot that they are trying to fool the educated people if India, people who understand the cheap tactics of this government. And the truth came out when the person luring the protests towards the Laal Killa came out to a BJP supporter. His pictures are on social media with the PM and the Home Minister Amit Shah in a conference room. The question to ask is, who can have access to the PMs conference room? Did anyone ask the PM to clarify his stand with Deep Sidhu? 

All this preplanned false propaganda was exposed, when people found out about the relationship of Deep Sidhu & BJP. This protest is stronger than ever now.BJP has failed every single protest , crushed every single voice that was raise against them through the false reporting of Godi media and by creating a false narrative. BJPs IT cell works tirelessly day and night by creating the false Twitter account and spreading fake news, just like the TRP scam by many renowned TV channels. 

People understand your propaganda now & you cant spread hatred by using false narrative. We stand in solidarity with our farmers and their rights. #farmersprotest"

JJ92,"Police blocked the road they agreed on the 26th and asked all farmers to go to the Red Fort --- it was premeditated because they wanted to separate the Sikhs from the protest by the pre-planned BJP. Before the farmer opened the Red Fort Gate and sat on police chairs and there already got the RSS 1000. It was planned to kill the farmers. On the 26th, no one disrespected the flag, there was an empty pole and the flag of nishan Sahib and farmer Union was put on that pole - nishan Sahib is the flag of Sikhism and is hosted in every country of the world and it means God, the likeness of all human beings. , the love and respect of all, the life of service and dedication and the Nishan Sahib were telling the farmers that they would win the protest. Sikhs are not terrorists the Red Fort was won by the Sikh Army under the leadership of Baghel Singh, Jassa Singh Ahluwalia and Jassa Singh Ramgarhia in the year 1783. He defeated the Mughals, sat on the throne of the emperor and raised the mark Sahib at the Red Fort. Mark Saheb was the first flag hosted in the Red Fort and no one has rights over the Red Fort more than the Sikhs but Modi has sold the Red Fort it is no longer a state building. In addition, the national Indian flag is from all sacrifices from Sikhs, while only 1% of the sacrifices from  Gujarat belong to both nishan Sahib and Indian flag sikhs for the national flag"

And since there was no social media at that time, the public was successfully fooled by the government (Congress at the time). BJP is the same as Congress. Remember that in the next elections people. Vote for someone different than these two if you really want to see change. If you really want to see a true democratic India with a government that is FOR its people, and not looting its people in broad daylight.

God is light in Him there is no darkness. And this whole world is owned by Jesus as well as the Kingdom of heaven. The Holy Father gave everything into His loving hands. Jesus also said those that follow me will not walk in darkness but have the light of life. The way of the righteous is like the rising of the sun more and more bright until it is COMPLETELY LIGHT. Jesus is the Light! So let our works become ought in Godonly made possible by the grace and telling people about Jesus who is God part of the Holy trinity we spread out light for we are made in Gods image. 


Jesus is God and loves you! 

For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
1 Corinthians 15:4 
This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.

S K,"Farmers especially our elderly farmers have been out since November protesting. Modi who has been bought out by  the rich corporations of Ambani  and Adani refuses to meet with them. He has barricaded himself. In fact hes ordered the police to throw water cannons, tear gas ,  and beat them up with sticks, throw air bombs and spikes on the farmers, they are beating them up even the old, they are thrown  in jail, 200 people are missing or murdered. Women have been sexually abused. They have blamed terrorists which there were none. They have blamed Khalistan yet it has nothing to do with them. They planted their own people to create friction and create riots amongst the farmers. When I look at the pictures of the farmers I see the sad faces of the elderly and it pulls at my conscience. If you cannot understand their plight or fight  you must not be a God-fearing human being or void of a conscience. You must believe in the  right wing media in India  Aka Fox News that is owned by the government to feed lies Propaganda conspiracy theories aimed to divide and undermine the largest protest in human history. If you cannot understand then you must not believe In humanity. These farmers are just fighting for their livelihoods And no one seems to care especially in India. And because of the abuse the outside world needs to and has  to take notice. Modi needs to be exposed. What he is doing is nothing short of what Hitler did to the Jews and they tried to hide it from the rest of the world. But we are noticing and we are going to fight for the farmers and the  elders who do not have a voice right now. Many of them have committed suicide because they could not make ends meet. Im sorry a lot of Hindus think this abuse of the farmers is OK with them as its not happening to them and they will not stand up for them. They they have a country that believes in Hinduism only and want to rid India of sikhs and muslims. India is a nationalist fascist non democratic country.  I actually think being under British rule was better than what we have now. At least we were united then. If you can look at the eyes of these elderly farmers that are sitting peacefully since November And just see their pain thats all I ask and let them be heard. If you cant do that then sadly you were void of compassion and empathy"

Razzi Warraich,"The National flag wasnt disrespected on January 26th. It was all preplanned by BJP to lure the youth in this direction and to defame the protest and blame it on one community. BJP has always spread hatred in the name of religion.  

The history of Nishan Sahib:

The news came first, the incident happened later. The flag on the glimpse of Punjab on the 26 January parade was the one which was hoisted on the Red Fort. This is not a flag, it is Nishan Sahib. Because of this Nishan Sahib, the Khalsa Army liberated the daughters and sisters of India from Ahmed Shah Abdali and kept the shame of India. This is the Nishan Sahib whose divine principle closed the North East borders forever to end 1000 years of slavery of Hindustan.

The same symbol is in Sahib Harmandir Sahib and the rest of the Gurudwaras to whom the vigilants of every religion-Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Jaini-bow down. By putting these symbols on the borders of the country, soldiers not only protect the borders but also sacrifice their lives. This Nishan Sahib is waved in foreign countries with foreign flags.

The Red Fort is the heritage of the Mughal period. By conquering this, the Sikh warriors of the Mughal throne brought to Amritsar and today millions of devotees bow their heads with respect to this historic symbol everyday. The fatwa of the martyrdom of Guru Teg Bahadur Sahib was given by Aurangzeb sitting on the throne of this Red Fort. The red color of this Red Fort is red with the bloodsheds of Guru Teg Bahadur Sahib's unparalleled sacrifice to save the existence of the Hindu religion."

Yes... Thousands of Modi's sarkari (govt) agents dressed up as police and farmers did the whole drama all over Delhi, including the Red Fort, in order to derail the real farmers peaceful protest.

Modi sarkar tried their level best to divert the attention of the public from the real issue at hand with their filthy gutter tactics.. and they did succeed for a while, but the public now knows better. Shameless Modi government !

Question is, who is going to put the Modi govt on trial for their evil crimes ?

Noel Percil,"i am totally against taliban,
but i cant help commenting negatively on how this channel is reporting..
in almost all your video, it seems that your fooling people.. you put a title  that is enticing, but is not the real event in the video, like this one: RESISTANCE FORCES FIERCELY FIGHTS BACK, and TALIBAN ARE TRAPPED,,,  but the video shows mainly a picture of a mountain which you edited with red circle. 

nowhere in the video shows fighting,.much less fierce one.. also there is no video and even a picture of talibans that are trapped..
and you just keep on repeating and repeating the same video that shows nothing related to the title of the video..
then you narrated that resistance forces blown up mountain, but there is no such thing in the video,, and wait,, HOW CAN YOU BLOW UP A MOUNTAIN? MOUNTAIN IS VERY HUGE, HOW CAN THAT  BE BLOWN UP?  AND RESISTANCE FORCES  WILL NOT BLOW UP THEIR MOUNTAIN BECAUSE THAT IS THEIR MAIN DEFENSE AGAINST TALIBAN...

im sorry, but your video - reporting is rubbish, perhaps you just want to gain publicity, and payment from youtube, but honestly, many of your video  lack quality, clarity and truthfulness.. try to review and change for good so that viewers will like and trust you."

It has been seen that whenever someone comes to destroy Islam, he himself perishes.  Look today Taliban which is nothing, which had no good gun weapon technology anything and now America which considered itself as a very big super power.  Look at his condition today, it is not worth showing his face to the whole world. And listen to the whole world with open ears.  Whenever anyone comes to destroy Islam, he himself will be destroyed.  Of course, Allah will make the habit of Islam to what extent, which is also mentioned in the Qur'an. Allah has said in the Qur'an that no one is a better fighter than Allah. Subhanallah Allah Huwakbar "

Modoc Jack,"This collapse was planned by the Communist traitors controlling the White House and Congress this handover of US. Military high Tec weapons technology is payment not to the Taliban but to the Chinese and Russians who have supported and funded these American Communists, The CCP is making deals with the Leadership of the Taliban for America's High Tech Equipment. This will greatly harm America and its Nato partners as well as Israel and Saudi Arabia. This is outright treason by President Biden and others at the highest levels of the American Government. These Traitors inside the Pentagon and CIA and White House have betrayed America and the free world."

Robert Lee,"Why do I keep hearing veterans talking about how they knew ten or more years ago this is how it would end?
I've got nothing but respect for the rank-and-file in all of the Armed Forces but you guys have a very exclusive position from which to view things and I guess it's kind of obvious most of us didn't have a clue that they could never unify enough to even identify with the country of Afghanistan as its current borders are drawn. First I want to thank you all for serving and then I want to- admonish you for leaving us all in the dark. We could have been out of there 10 years ago had we known the reality of the people on the ground. Seems to me a lot of the invested blood-sweat-and-tears the lives lost and the money spent could have been much less. We know you guys aren't in any position to critique your superiors and wouldn't want you to however never hesitate to share some information you have that we do not because we can go stand on that (Capital) Hill and fight for you here at home, but only if it's something we know about. And I'm not trying to make a big issue out of it right now I just wanted to throw that out there for consideration because you guys have a lot of support here (even though is sometimes hard to tell), so you don't have to stick your neck out by yourself, we can help you with that, we want to help you with that, and I just wanted to let you know that.
Keep us in the loop please just be careful how you do it no reason information sharing like that would have to be anything other than ""Anonymous"""

 Its shameful on a big country like India, which ignores/threatens  minorities in the broad day light in the heart of the country. This is a black mark on the media houses and constitution of India, who are the spectators of wrong doers. Can India  prove to the world that its a democratic and secular country?

As no country will want to be single enemy when pakistan and china has already joined hands with Taliban and that's totally fair from Indain Govt. Taliban was a terrorist group and always will be one. So, don't potray as if they have changed."

Think about and seek answers for what comes next.  If your honest about the outcome, i can tell you, the answer is Jesus.

A relationship starts with a solemn seeking and prayer asking Him into your life.  If you are uncertain Jesus is God, seek and ask Him and He will break all your doubts.

To be saved: beliece that the work Jesus did on the cross (His death and resurrection on the 3rd day) is sufficient to cleanse you of all your sins for those who accept Him as Savior and repent (turn from) their sins and FOLLOW Him."

The Taliban have support from the locals from the tribes , even the military prob supports Taliban that's why they just run away they want them to take over.

We literally saw a tribe leader support Taliban publicly that's how it works they have political power they have religious power and they have the support of the people. That's why there was no fight.

People just want to be lead to someone that shows strength.

It's the only way it make sense.

Same thing happened with ISIS in Iraq.
People didn't even fight. It's not cause they were afraid or demoralized , they had nothing to fight for some even supported ISIS."

Hypocrats
First, free your Pakistan from begging for America, British, China,Russia...
Please read the history of Pakistan. From the day Hypocrats Pakistan was born it started asking for help from the US and UK and now China.
What is slavery? Your constitution is the constitution of the United Kingdom. Your official language is English.
When America and other western countries help Pakistan you don't concern about the Islam.
When they help Afghanistan, you call the Afghan Government infidels.
You know who is a disbeliever? in Islam and who is a slave? Hypocrats
When America stopped giving you charity you cried for beging from America and the rest of the world. What do you think about China and Russia? Are they Muslims?
Allow your Pakistani Taliban to enforce Sharia law in Pakistan and rid Pakistan of the ideology of America, China, Russia, United Kingdomand other infidels....
Let  Pakistani Taliban raise their Islamic flag instead of your national flag.

V K Gupta,"Imran Khan has praised the Taliban for breaking the chains of slavery (gulami). If that is the case the Afghan population should be ecstatic and flinging flowers at the incoming Taliban soldiers as the French population welcomed the Free French and Allied soldiers after the liberation of France in WWII. Will Imran Khan explain as to why thousands of Afghans are trying to flee the country? Thousands of Afghans are thronging the Kabul airport, border gates of the neighboring countries, resistance in the Panjashir Valley, and the cities rising up about the national flag. So, where is great welcome for the conquering heroes that Imran Khan seems to be so taken with? S M Qureshi is visiting different countries to obtain international recognition for these blood thirsty cut throats. Pakistan will have lot to answer."

Shaan Karim,India was funding TTP ( tehreek taliban pakistan ) since India has left Afghanistan; not a single attack on pakistani soil ....
Shaan Karim,"He will work hard to "" take out kashmiris "" from indians slavery...insh Allah"
HaiwanFN,this was taken out of context
A S,"Imran Khan has not praised the ""Taliban takeover"" at all. He has asserted multiple times including very recently, that there should be an inclusive government in Afghanistan in which all factions of the Afghan population have their due representation.
When he used the words ""Breaking the chains of slavery"" he was referring to the withdrawal of foreign military troops from Afghanistan. Because he has always maintained that Afghanistan should be governed by Afghan people themselves, therefore, the US must end its military occupation and all foreign military forces must withdraw from Afghanistan. That would be the only way to end this years-long conflict.
If you listen to him properly over the years then you can easily find out that he has always been of the view that ""there is no military solution in Afghanistan"" but at that time, so-called intellectuals of the western media didn't bother to listen. In fact, they ridiculed him as ""Taliban Khan"". But today all the countries including the US with all its arrogance and might have agreed to the same conclusion that ""There is no military solution in Afghanistan."""

Ab by,"Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses seat. So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other peoples shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.
Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called Rabbi by others. But you are not to be called Rabbi, for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth father, for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted"".
(Matt 23 NIV)

YOU SHALL NOT MAKE FOR YOURSELF AN IMAGE in the form of anything, in Heaven above or in the Earth beneath, or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents up to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.

""If my people who are called by my name, humble themselves and pray, AND TURN FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS, I will hear from Heaven, will forgive their sins, and will heal their land.""

AND WHEN YOU PRAY, DO NOT BE LIKE THE HYPOCRITES, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. BUT WHEN YOU PRAY GO INTO YOUR ROOM, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.

This, then, is how you should pray:

Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your name,
your kingdom come,
your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts,
as we also have forgiven our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from the evil one.

For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.

""Matthew 5-7 NIV Bible Gateway"", we can use google search.
These are the teachings,
The Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ our God.
REPENT, and start doing what is right.
If you abide my teachings, you are really my disciples; then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.

Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in Truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.
GOD IS SPIRIT so his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in Truth.

In the New Heaven and New Earth,
only Righteousness dwells.
May the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God be with you all."
