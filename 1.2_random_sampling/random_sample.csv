"This is all planned by Pakistan, khalistani, muslim, opposite party,baniya, middleman
How Pakistan is investing in this protest
Pakistan is transferring money to Canadian Khalistani organization and where they both collect money and transfer in india for protest as well as in india, money is collected from opposition party, middleman,anti aliment muslim, khalistani sikh.
What's will be effect from them by protest
1. Pakistan will effect Indian economy by internal riots without Pakistan military attack
2. Indian Muslim and Sikhs can stop India to become hindu rastra
3. Opposite political party can defeat bjp and make own government
4. Sikh will agrue from  in the name of bjp.
Their strategy to stop voters to vote bjp
1. Say them bhagat
2. Say them bjp it cell
But all we know now that's their in comments section 80% Pakistani it cell + khalistani it ce ll is working and if others comments in favour of bjp government then they will say it's bjp it cell or godi media .
But internally 80% khalistani and Pakistani it cell is working so that they can increase riots in india.
Be aware from Indian name I'd in comments they all are Pakistani but have made Indian named id so that they can make fool to Indian youthhhhh"

WION plz show this I always see you barking and yelling at others matters. Now cover this. Godi media can't show you reality
Indias government has sold its soul for the corporate mantra. No one should be surprised at this level of corruption.
Farmers definitely win
"Meanwhile Indian media is calling them Khalistan terrorists , Pakistan agents, and dubbing the whole thing as foreign media games to hurt Indias image! India is a totally delusional country now."

I stand with the farmers! Big Corporate Agra giants are destroying small farms all over the world. This is not just an India problem. It is a global problem. Stay strong! Your voices will be heard! You will have victory!
Thanks for covering us
Very disappointing reportage by you on the farmers gathering at Muzzafarnagar. You must have deliberately avoided showing speeches of farmer leaders.
Farm laws actually helps farmers so stop spreading hatred.
The root cause of all this is that ninety percent of  media is sold out & they have become a bunch of lyers.
"BJP, the most caring Indian government."
I am supporting farmers
1:03 looks like Indian police are more violent than Taliban special forces.
Arm them
"*I Hope Modi government is overthrown the worst Dictator in India history, Look as the Fat motherlover from BJP*"
This video is from Pakistan there are no such protests in india! Fake news
I am also a farmer the problem is with MSP only.
Indian media is defaming these farmers...
modi the butcher of gujrat
I can see more pisfuls in this rally for their malicious propaganda
India is obsessed with taliban and isi rather than working for the farmers... The same farmers stopped export to Pakistan just to be part of modis politics.... Here they are now.
Govt have surplus  wheat and rice  then why govt want subsudi
To run tractors on police is violence
Capitalism is facing push back from the 2 largest countries in the world.
Modi is selling you out and doing whatever the usa says. Probably have a war with China at the direction of the usa. Modi is a puppet leader ordained by Washington.
I remember when taleban was cannong those rushing to airport and indianedia was calling them barbaric but then i saw many indian police videos n i am shocked
Transnational agribusinesses are controlling our food systems while destroying our planet & everyones health while enticing their pockets.  Unbelievable!!!
Propaganda washing the poor famers mind ....
Despite all the economic crisis this is the right time to start up an investment
Naxalite is the future of India. Support country Naxalite and its government. Naxalite is always with you to alleviate poverty and ensure equal human rights.
"No South Indian farmer protester. Its just Chinese propaganda.  
They are loosing money. Poor getting rich. Oh protest against modi. Rich ppl vote for congress. Oh wait there in not many rich ppl compared to the ratio of the populations. Lol robbers and thieves."

"The lips of the righteous feed many,

"More power to these farmers, keep fighting till your last breathe."
"Goodluck to my Punjabi brothers and sisters, and all fellow Indians fighting against injustice and corruption.
Inshallah the far right will learn from this through the economic sacrifice they have caused by marginalising there own citizens!"
Shame on Modi government. Those farmers from long time protest
Modi is a dictator who is anti-peasantry and working only for elite class of his own caste and state...   Time for India to be given back to the people...
"Problem with India is there are no Good opposition.
that's why Bjp is in power.
Congress is in complete decline because of Family politics(they should give leadership to mr shashi) 
whereas in Other states like tamil,bengal etc regional parties are popular."
Here you go again!
Indian media are not showing this thanks international media
They want to control food you have to fight to stop them
"Jai kisan Jai mazdoor
Corporated govt murdabaad
The fight is to protect food from going into the hands of corporates
As well as farmers right
Both farmers and consumers will have to suffer under these farm laws"
BJP looks more brutal than the 'current Taliban'.
The only people I love in India r farmers.
"2013 communal riots is still fresh in our mind's and maybe more in especially jaat community today.
That time sanjeev baliyan ji was the only one leader frm BJP who come in support. These RLD leader jayant choudhary flew to haryana leaving his people.
And u talk with people of muzaffarnagar, those3 wounds are stil fresh.
They may support tikat in farm protests, but when it comes to voting, they believe, it's only BJP and yogi ji, who can provide them 247 safety. Not SP, RLD or Cong."
We can't survive without farmers but our leaders never seem to appreciate such a simple fact.
"Nothing is gonna happen.. Shutdown by farmers will happen only in punjab and some parts of haryana.
I think this is theirs maybe 46th nation wide shutdown., But whole India was opened and working.
This tikait guy doesn't have guts to reach even lucknow and conduct atleast Uttar pradesh shutdown, his own state..
Even his own jaat community people wont even listen to this guy, if he tell to vote against BJP. 
His father choudhary Mahendra singh tikat was a great farmer leader, but this guy don't have any credibility at all."
"As long as Modi is in power, no one can live in peace in India."
Khalistan want freedom from India brutality and cruelty
Khalistan freedom fighters long live
Wrong report...
Khalistan is the only solution for these farmers. Otherwise oppression is their fate.
Surprise  no   sanctioned blockade   etc   or inhumane GITMO prison either.   Same  gangsters thieves corrupt WAR CRIMINALS  &   apartheid to DISCRIMINATING  led  terrorists act  &   land theft expansion Marches on..  &  also  inhumane CONCENTRATION prison camps  too...aka Kashmir to gujrati to  Bangladesh enslaved TOO...  or laughing COWS Marches on
"The farm laws will benefit the farmers, they can still sell their crops in mandi if they want to, selling it to corporate is just optional"
Come on REAL democracy INDIA   SPRING CIVIL WAR etc or  go  CHINA TEAM led.   .
Come on  REAL democracy INDIA SPRING CIVIL WAR LIBERATED etc &   also NUKES itself TOO.    Thanks  apartheid MODI REGIME'S.      Via  same  REGIME'S change again too.
Everybody wins again or   Allah akbar.
Indian prime minister PM Modi serving his masters who invested huge amount of money to elect him as pm. Now its payback time. So Primr Minister Modi selling every government sector to ambani and Adani group. Some of the money is going to Israel and France for technigal and military support. Wost prime minister in Indian history.
"1. No masks or social distancing. 2. How are they still producing crops if they have all been at the rally for so many months? 3. All of them are the middle men, who will lose a lot by corporations taking over. Have I missed anything out? 
Do these idiots honestly think the pandemic is over? They may not be bothered about themselves, but what about the thousands who are going to be infected? 
Do these idiots really think that everybody believes that they are all farmers and that they haven't been harvesting the crops? 
Another super-spreader here and then they will blame the govt. for that, and never themselves. IMO, the protesters are all idiots and so are the people supporting them."
Islam needs to rule India in order for progress
It's so evil... God bring justice to the people
Down with BJP fascism
I stand with Indian farmers who feed billion people. They must be given due rights.
NOW FOOD CRISIS IN INDIA
India the country where Police use huge Sticks to beat people
"?? Seriously folks, this protest is about as effective as a 2 year child old stomping his feet when he doesn't get what he wants... if you want to fight the giant corporations and survive, then block their front gates for a week or two and stop production, then when their sales drop they will change pay attention."
Shame on Indian fascist govt
Support Indian farmers
Modi is on his lowest popularity farmers would be last nail in Modi's coffin.
Goriya stand by
"50 th national shutdown announced that is only enforced in Punjab by violent famers.

I want them to make this an election issues and ponder at the results, just so they can see that their own children don't suport them"
These farmers are fighting for their future. They do not want their future like todays USA farmers .
Why our PM is so silent on this issue
"How soft policy of present government. But media is not showig real picture.The politician calling it Jailianwala Bagh. There was kisan Andolan in 1998 when police opened fired and killing 24 kisan in Multai, Madhya Pradesh."

"Why the docait head has not bee cracked yet? I am disappointed. The officer who ordered to crack the head should be promoted. These undemocratic bunch of illiterates have taken the country into hostage. If the govt is not ready to listen to them, they should vote the opposition and defeat the present Govt. What is this nonsense going on since a year? The roads are blocked, people are suffering for these few sponsored so called Kishans"
"The stand of Sardar Gurnam Singh Chaduni is commendable  that is, the Whole present political system of our Democratic & secular country may be said responsible for harassing the Kissans. 
      So  that a new party namely All India Kissan-Mazdoor Party should be made by Agriculture people for flushing out corporated  based politicians by democratic votes."

No Farmers are involved in these road blocks and illegal agitations.Tikaet is getting funds from Khalistani supporters from abroad. Congress   party is fully behind hese illegal irresponsible  meaningless agitations by goons who just plan to block India's developments which are very rapid and remarkable  under Modi Government.
"Dear YouTube, 10 hours ago, ndtv had 2 videos with the same storyline about official who asked to crack heads. This shows ndtv runs a propaganda news."
taliban is even ruled in india
"*ALL PROFESSIONS ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT.... Farmers is just like another profession. There is no need to put them on a pedestal. Some people quote them as ANDH DATTA & that without farmers there will be no food. and as such must support them. What if there were no doctors, nurses, frontliners; many would hv died during this pandemic What if there were no jawans, police & security personal; there would be anarchy. What if there were no bankers, money lender...; there would financial system will collapse. etc, etc... Bottom line EVERYONE IS IMPORTANT including the police*"
"ORDERS CAME FROM ABOVE MEANS FEKU / THADIPAR   COMBINE .

How can a police personal ordered to his team to Crack the head of the farmers and due to which one farmer died it was notorious activity done by Haryana police with the support of CM haryana and back support of M/s Modi & Shah. It is shameful for our democratic country.
"Next Selling assets of nation to Ambani and Adani  will take place . After 25 years People has to stand in queue for Ambani and Adani to get their services.  Why this govt is doing this ? no one is understanding the dangers .  These are the foundation stones to break the democratic setup.

This tikait doesn't know anything about the farm laws.I saw one of his interview where he couldn't answer what is his problem with farm laws.I belong to a farmer family from andhra pradesh but I never voted BJP. I support farmlaws and Modiji.
Why doesn't the government speak to the farmers and close this issue since and for all it will have a negative impact on the economy.
India is the known as land of traitors as the British terminology suggests like Australia is the land of convicts as well as New Zealand is known as the land of eccentrics.The man who seats  in a far away land wanted to creat new world order by behind the scene stage managed show of farmer's agitation to cripple the Indian state via his proxy's like different NGOS and different skyfall media groups who do anti-India propaganda to create mayhem and anarchy here in India.Let's see what happens as his missions in Ukraine failed miserably due to the solid thrashing by the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Everyone knows which party is funding these protests
HT is showing this news as if Tikat is a responsible person .heights of irresponsible reporting by HT . Shame
Tikat is misleading innocent people. What a shame
Thank u farmers for inviting corona and once again heading towards lockdown. Desh ki unattai aise hi kijiyega
Get ready for 3rd wave of corona virus.  Don't blame state or Central governments. Cos we farmers didn't take any precautions or follow covid SOP. Thank you
The funniest part is he doesn't even know foarm laws
He is trying to open his political account! Nothing else. Opportunist
Kumbh is causing covid in kisan mahapanchayat. Rss and facist modi should resign.
This clown should be punished.

"Bengal should rise up n take back the whole of bengal....free india n change back to its original nation....bengal
Maybe punjab too"
They have to do.. not like you news channels associated holes.. they are fighting for there rights.
Shame on what this channel is bringing to public. All the government has to do is cancel the farming laws and the farmers will leave happily.  The government can choose not risk the public health. The farmers have been protesting the laws for the past six months through the harsh weather and the pandemic yet the Prime Minister of India has not taken a single step in resolving this issue. All because his ego is more important that the livelihood of such a large population. The farmers are fighting for their life one way or another so shame on this channel for said for talking about human health but wasnt concerned when all the rallies were taking place. This is a violation of human rights and the media is corrupt so dont sit behind closed doors and talk about whats the right thing to do because it surely isnt what youre doing.
They are all healthy.No one get infected. Corona dont come in farmers crowd?
No way to support these broker mandi walas. Let farmers get benefit from this bill
Keep it up farmers we are with you.
"Government at fault, Just repeal the laws so they can go home and rest. 100% government at fault.  Godi Media trying hard to defame farmers hahaha."

"People are not getting oxygen and medicines.  Till covid issue is not under controlled all protests , election and exams should be stopped"
When rally can happen then why not this
"They are trying to take advantage of the Covid situation. Farm laws along with direct benefit transfer has made this is a do or die battle for middle men and these protests should fail. Government should not budge. Many of the below ""farmer supporter"" just want to make the government to backtrack so they can use this politically."
This isn't the time to protest please stop

"""Pakistan Today"" is thrilled beyond words at this lawlessness. Shame on your channel."
You stop your channel and stay home because its COVID
Without canceling these laws nothing would help bjp government this time .if they care about citizens they should do it
"Cancel the law, stop kicking on farmers stomach.they will go back"
"Farmers are suiciding all over India, government is hiding it's data. They will anyways die due to farm bills,so better fight n die instead of giving up and die.jai jawan jai kisan "

Humble request to all farmers to stop such protests..

"Repeal the laws and they will go
Home. Quite simple"
No wonder there is Sikh jokes..
"Gov can just cancel the law and stop this March... That is the good way of ending this strike..why Modi government is not doing that ?????
