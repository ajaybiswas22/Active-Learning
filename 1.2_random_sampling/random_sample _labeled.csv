"This is all planned by Pakistan, khalistani, muslim, opposite party,baniya, middleman
How Pakistan is investing in this protest
Pakistan is transferring money to Canadian Khalistani organization and where they both collect money and transfer in india for protest as well as in india, money is collected from opposition party, middleman,anti aliment muslim, khalistani sikh.
What's will be effect from them by protest
1. Pakistan will effect Indian economy by internal riots without Pakistan military attack
2. Indian Muslim and Sikhs can stop India to become hindu rastra
3. Opposite political party can defeat bjp and make own government
4. Sikh will agrue from  in the name of bjp.
Their strategy to stop voters to vote bjp
1. Say them bhagat
2. Say them bjp it cell
But all we know now that's their in comments section 80% Pakistani it cell + khalistani it ce ll is working and if others comments in favour of bjp government then they will say it's bjp it cell or godi media .
But internally 80% khalistani and Pakistani it cell is working so that they can increase riots in india.
Be aware from Indian name I'd in comments they all are Pakistani but have made Indian named id so that they can make fool to Indian youthhhhh",2

This tikait doesn't know anything about the farm laws.I saw one of his interview where he couldn't answer what is his problem with farm laws.I belong to a farmer family from andhra pradesh but I never voted BJP. I support farmlaws and Modiji.,0
Why doesn't the government speak to the farmers and close this issue since and for all it will have a negative impact on the economy.,1
India is the known as land of traitors as the British terminology suggests like Australia is the land of convicts as well as New Zealand is known as the land of eccentrics.The man who seats  in a far away land wanted to creat new world order by behind the scene stage managed show of farmer's agitation to cripple the Indian state via his proxy's like different NGOS and different skyfall media groups who do anti-India propaganda to create mayhem and anarchy here in India.Let's see what happens as his missions in Ukraine failed miserably due to the solid thrashing by the Russian President Vladimir Putin.,0

Shame on what this channel is bringing to public. All the government has to do is cancel the farming laws and the farmers will leave happily.  The government can choose not risk the public health. The farmers have been protesting the laws for the past six months through the harsh weather and the pandemic yet the Prime Minister of India has not taken a single step in resolving this issue. All because his ego is more important that the livelihood of such a large population. The farmers are fighting for their life one way or another so shame on this channel for said for talking about human health but wasnt concerned when all the rallies were taking place. This is a violation of human rights and the media is corrupt so dont sit behind closed doors and talk about whats the right thing to do because it surely isnt what youre doing.,1

It's unacceptable MBBS INTERN faced Covid19 wearing PPE will get 20k salary per month

But this will impact 2022 , 2023 , 2024 all

And then NO BJP NO TRILLION DOLLARS ECONOMY , a great ECONOMIC DISASTER waits in future 

Problem is Opposition don't have leaders who can take it to people and tell them facts

How SC ST OBC RESERVATION without EWS QUOTA , that will be bagged by rich CENTRAL GOVERNMENT 7PC SC ST OBC getting lakhs only

Government must postpone NEET UG PG Exam to mid November / December

To increase seats 5 times in PG at least 3 times in UG 

Or else no intelligent will take MBBS MD MS DM MCH in future
