this is only expected behaviour on the part of the bjp and their mouthpieces the speaker or dy speaker i use the word mouthpiece deliberately i know they are supposed to be neutral presiding officers in both houses a supreme court which largely shies away from putting the government on the mat when required manipulating election commissioners they have done it all they believe in the tyranny of the 62 by their 38 they have this huge majority but only 38 vote share and that too because of large contributions from a few states
mohdi is telling you that this is the international border this side hindustan that side khalistan what is the confusion congratulations on your independence khalistan zindabad

farm law was for the benifits of 80 farmers of india

the real reason behind all these laws is this import of food grains is cheaper for the indian government because international prices are low some economists have advised the government to import food grains rather buy them at a higher price from the indian farmers that way the fiscal deficit can be controlled this thinking guides the three laws but why in the first place are the international prices low because the foreign governments compensate their own farmers by giving them a hefty subsidy

brother what you are saying is the silver lining that is hiring the ugly truth from all of us why are we not looking it in long run what private firm do is that they trap in suppliers with golden words n et into a contract with them n becoz of the honey words farmers will go on toward them n mandie is will get a hit from that when there will be no supply mundies will stop working n get closed at that time private firms will be able to take advantage of the situation because farmers will be contract bounded why this bill does not give a proper method to solve the disputes that are going to occur in future only appalate level what the fuck is that faint firms like jio mart that you mentioned can go to supreme court with big corporate lawyers how do you suppose a group of 40 farmers can fight that situation in long run is what is the issue with government not including msp in outside mandi transaction they are already tax free it is a good deal for private firms

bjp and congress both have expressed the issues with apmc mandi having lots of issues kerala n many other states do not use the mandi rice grower of kerala are not protesting the projected roles of adatiya being glorified by this lady why is this protest since the large growers of wheat do not know the tax payer money of 33000 crores which was coming to the states what will happen govt has been buying the wheat its reaching the pds shops via apmc and not that all the goods sold is class a in fact the pds ration shop wheat is not palatable by a common man this means a good grower of wheat lets say 100 quintals in reality is selling 200 quintals in apmc out of which 100 is stones and not real wheat then the money related to this wheat goes to middlemen and farmers ashirvad atta company or similar ones do not buy this wheat when farmer dumps his wheat in apmc mandi who finally buys it from there and where does the wheat gets utilised has the real answers for this protest why does govt still imports despite bumper crop or farmer does not export if he has done excellent quality and has a fear of the price drop few questions are based on fears these are away from reality on ground the news channel should visit apmc ware houses and show the pictures of rats and rotten wheat laying lack of disposal in time and usage that will clear all the muck the channels are not spending time to show real ware house conditions

this is the gift of getting nation out of food insecurity
congress is a curse on india
anyone with common sense can see that the current system needs change the current system is propping up the punjab argri sector and giving them over inflated returns which is obviously not fair to the rest of the farmers in india i can empathise with punjabi farmers as they are used to this preferential treatment but deep down even they must know this cannot go ahead for much longer as it is ultimately not promoting equality
your target audience is educated they will read farm bill and other bills
bjp k chor darr gaye

in punjab free electricity should also be given to physically handicapped as is given to farmers dalits and obc s
and why would any farmer stay antil their need in their farms why will they remain wasting their time in protests during their sowing and harvesting season no farmers who would actually be suffering would wait for so long for any purpose during their sowing and harvesting season starting from 9th august and continued for 7 months and 2 days can any farmer stay for so long no they cannot then who are these they are the fake farmers or not an indian because no indian would create chaos on the republic day of his her country india

truth is there are a ton of loopholes in these laws and when corporations are involved they exploit each and every loophole to the fullest just look the the nps process of approving loans are exploited by corporations another reason to consider is that we cannot let the food market to be a monopoly designed monopoly or duopoly in us telecom companies carve out area so that they can maintain monopoly indian food corporations might do the same ultimately the entire nation has a lot to lose if these laws fail to protect the farmers as well as consumers
please stop now is not the time to protest india is suffering please stop

dhruv brother you are unaware of true facts initially all farmer union leaders decided to perform tractor parade on ring road but later due to unkown reasons they changed their decision on midnight of 25th january to march on route given by delhi police this created confusion and anger among all protestors therefore people decided to march on initial route against the permission of delhi police from this you can understand that deep sidhu and lakha sidhana were not responsible for any action but the union leaders are truly responsible coming towards the red fort topic is it an offense to raise farmer is flag and nishan sahib on empty pole where there was no tricolor at all is it legal in our constitution for rss to raise their flag on red fort rules must be same for everyone moreover if you say that red fort is highly prestigious and respected site of india then is it okay for our pm to sell this public property to dalmia bharat group for span of 5 years in exchange of money mr rathee you cannot prove farmers guilty and justify others without stating true facts now when you decide to make video on something please be aware of each and every fact and must provide the every side of story

if this was a pan india protest why there was no one from large rice producing states like andhra tamilnadu karnataka bengal did not join and agitate for full year this is not an indian farmer agiataion but agitation of farmers belonging to two and a half states of india who would lose their source of income if government stops the mandi press is also silent on the funding given from extremist organisations in canada and uk without which these agitations would have run out of steam in the long run press should also look into the funding received by these so called indian farmers

can experts here tell me point wise the benefits of these laws for farmers and also address the apprehensions of the farmers
jai hind be safe be in unity
modi government is worst than chinese communist in the name of democracy
no one begrudges anyone including farmers to become rich and wear boss or calvin klein on marching protests but these rich goons are bullies who have held the govt at ransom and are actively suppressing the poor farmer in bihar up odisha etc who barely has a torn baniyaan or gunjee to wear and who mostly ends as wage laborer for these rich goons in punjab etc

so government have officially confirmed to the nation that there will be the minimum support price and it will not be removed in fact since 2014 government has bought more food from farmers to support them then the earlier government
they r not farmer now farmer in doing their job they r anti social

this joker tikait is now making it clear that he does not care about farm laws or farmers he is only trying to be limelight till up elections where he had lost twice previously he is trying his luck this time and will keep making noises
but the main responsibility for the fall of kabul lies with afghanistan only in two decades afghanistan has received billions of dollars in economic and military aid and support from the world india and other countries have invested billions of dollars in nation building the usa trained and equipped afghanistan is military and provided billions of dollars in aid but there was a lack of political will and civic will to defend itself against extremist groups political leaders gave up against 70 80k taliban fighters 300000 military surrendered and civilians opted to flee or hide instead of protesting and fighting for their rights and future when there is no factor within the country there is no will power then its downfall is inevitable because when you do not decide to fight yourself no one will stand for you

i really like his statement that all strong leaders should win so that if government does anything wrong the opposition can question it he wants change in government but not weak opposition
hi is reall tigher ahead sha
as a farmer myself the decision by govt of india is correct it benefits poor farmers this is done by opposition parties as most of the farmers are illiterate they do not understand the benefits of these laws
it is totally acceptable if farmers do protest for something if they do not like about government
pakistan always felt proud u mr tariq fateh solute you great job sir
farmers should demand nationalization all adani owned food items storage facilities
as being a daughter of a middle class farmer i think violence is not necessary and yeah we can solve it out but neither government and nor the farmers are ready to listen i live in punjab also and yeah it is been months since this is happening but me and my family are not involving in this we belive in talking and solving this problem so both the people and government can be satisfied hope this fight will end soon with peace

i hope people are aware of this funds
very bad government in the world
the joke is on you bhakt couple the 3 farm bills have been repealed
modi is an elected representative when he sees no farmers supporting the bills but sees farmers who oppose the bills he has to do what an elected representative is supposed to
the process can be hardened with feedback over the years and a robust dynamic system can evolve
3 bills 3 simple points 1 govt should write it in the bill itself that msp will not be removed farmers want written assurances 2 eca bill it is no problem to farmers but it will affect all the consumers in india unless you dont eat food govt has removed the hoarding limit on essential commodities so private corporations can store as much of food grains and essentials commodities as much they want in this way they can make artificial shortage in the market and prices will go high and inflation go up and it will effect all consumers and their is more point in it that govt cant intervene unless it reach double so this govt helping middleman not removing it 3 3 corporate farming in this there is a provision that if any private corporation doesnt pay to the farmer in 15 days he can only complaint to sdm he cant go upper judiciary
fassi is real justice
are the genuine poor farmers even capable of such largescale dharna isnt it pure politics of the middlemen who would now have no role and obviously no margins
the main question is that why is bihari farmer still the poorest in india even though they under new laws since 2006 and these are the same laws as passed by bjp last year

at least to strike a compromise govt need to have a seperate agency to act as a business resource center for the farmers in each state that they can go to to give them business guidance teach them business negotiating skills etc
she is a bullshit journalist
who made modi a pm who is shamelessly destroying country and countrymen not doing anything for price rise unemployment only lying fooling people on hindu card

their main agenda is to subvert india as the protestors are not genuine farmers
this bill has many negative externalities and does not serve public good or the interest of the public infact it encourages monopolization of perfectly competitive markets which naturally leads to inefficiencies and discourages innovation thats why in most countries monopolies are illegal not sure why india is stepping away from free markets to a monopolized system
badoria has a problem he is in sp and is unhappy and disgusted with popat akilesh so badoria is taking out his frustation on the anchor and bjp
no wonder kamla harris and joe biden had no option but to give lessons of democratic principles to this pm during his recent visit to us which seems to be the reason of his return 2 days earlier than planned
nation reforms should have been passed across all states by excluding protesting ones protesting states should have been given freedom to pass their own version at state level
can we get pdf please
modi is a politician at the end of day he thought of doing something in his capacity for the farmers and vast majority were happy with it but if a vocal minority of rich powerful vested interest group with strong pr is denting his image worldwide why would he care about farmers but when the silent majority actually realize what they lost it will be too late they missed a golden opportunity if they are so naive to comprehend who their friend is and who is their foe they are better off being left to their fate modi will find a way to win election but the farmers will never find a solution for their problems

history will remember our dear farmers were the ones who saved democracy in india it is a lesson learnt by our generation that a party who wins by a huge margin can go crazy in an autocratic manner can pass bills in the parliament can choose to ignore opposition can take the very people who voted them to victory for a ride only persistence and unity of the people in a peaceful manner can make them bow down hail the farmers of india on 11 12 21 at 09 00hrs the farmers will do a victory march back to their states punjab farmers have sought the permission of the chief ministers of some states to hare helicopters to drop flowers on the returning farmers returning farmers have decided to go to harminder sahib golden temple to thank the almighty farmers of all races are together never in the history has this happened before modi who used to be called the aurangzeb of modern india did a 180 degrees turn godi media has made the farmers stronger kisan from london

imma give my boards and i need to graps the news so i have my own opinion and it will help me in exams essays and all
farming is very different from other industries as every crop is harvested in a short span of time every year this creates a large gap between demand and suppy hence making it a free market was a curse on everyone thanks that some wisdom prevailed and farmers are saved from the ruthless hands of corporates the need of the hour is that we work together to bring crop diversity and to motivate farmers to grow crops which are imported this will make us self reliant and decrease imports
we can understand indias pain
thanks for raising voice for farmers
congratulations to the farmers of india
rights of every citizen and their livelihood is paramount
he is a joker of india d

one thing is clear what ever the bill comes or technology advances farmers will be going to struggle a lot since one or the other loopholes will strike that farmers may not aware of in advance
why you do not you bring a kisan leader who better understands the ground realities as this government has completely denied to take consultations from stakeholders in nearly every legislation this is very worrying trend which is leading our country to a authoritarian regime and you so called news channels has became cheerleaders of government
you explained good but let me tell you if you want to make kisaan understand than you need to use very simple language and hindi terms may be that way you can make them understand take this as a feedback
companies can procure from farmers not under control with paying taxes to mandis

farmers always get their rights in whole world what is happening to india

i did not believe modi retreated from farm laws the laws were a necessity i hope somehow we could have defeated the goons like dakait and taken the national interest private sector would have done wonders sad
if each and every party is protesting against one party then bjp is 1000 right
answer to those who said farmers bhole hain and unhe bhadkiya gaya he toh inhe kisne bhadkiya
khalistanis from canada uk the pakistani isi cpi and the congress are all involved in stoking this fire using gullible farmers for the agenda these guys are hell bent on causing chaos the government must now show its mailed fist the police cbi and nsi should document and investigate each and every rioter who has broken the laws of the country there is no back down this is treachery of the highest order rest of india must stand solidly behind the government country in handling these anarchists

howcome only the punjab and haryana farmers are doing why not others think because lot of mandi heads gonna loose their political leadership and state can loose around 4000cr but in overall the new bills are most useful for the farmers but these dumb leaders wrongly guiding the farmers and dont even know what is actually in the bill how many how them know only two products comes under msp only wheat and paddy what about the rest of the products in india now we have excess of wheat and paddy just spoiling at the storage centers eaten by rodents wake up check the bill and you understand really what is there

bill 3 hoarding will result in controlling of prices suppose there is a bumper crop production due to the high level supply the price of the crop will reduce so the corporates who have huge facilities of storing these foods will hoard it now when the supply is less and prices go up these companies will not buy due to obvious reasons as it is costly for them thus the farmer will be facing difficulty in both situations if there is a rule for msp for all the players in the market then i think it will reduce the uncertainty
a debate on similar models adopted in different countries and the impact on the living standards is needed every time india experiments we have seen naysayers same thing happened when we decided to get our share in the global economy our living standard improved and economists resented the late entry

does it not matter to responsible indians that this pm who is unbelievably active on social media has not sent a single msg for the victims crushed or one word of condemnation for the bjp minister
we all must oppose in the interest of our kisan and the country
one other question nobody has answered is why only punjab haryana and a part of up farmers are agitating why not in bengal where the tmc is strong or in maharashtra or in tn where the people chant all the time go back modi there is no traction at all in tn karnataka kerala where again bjp has zero presence or in ap why

anyway this repeal took too long due to political interference from khalistani is same tikait had praised the new laws in beginning and opposition supporting strike for it was their manifesto idea but bjp took credit so must be opposed thus meaning their manifesto idea had today failed by the repeal it is easy to blame modi is not it

in my opinion the laws should have been withdrawn months ago because one can easily see that lakhs of people in guises of farmers have surrounded delhi and they were entrenched so much that they could have surrounded delhi for not only months but years together
when some farmers died a naturaldeath photos of the dead were circulated in far off villages in punjab stating that they were martyred during the farmers protest in delhi in order to generate resentment against the modi government
long live corrupt govt officials

very good explaination sir
lollzz kept the nation and media busy for 1 year jai modi
fantastic work by team on collecting data from past to present but the real disappointment is that video does not talk about any real solution your experts are only finding shortcuts of blaming pl480 scheme of 1950 till the latest acts dear iit professors and experts pls do not be only knowledge babus pls apply your mind and make one more video suggesting some real solutions most confusing is the statement that india need 42000 mandis hwile it has only 6500 have the current 6500 mandis of punjab and haryana within 80 km of farmers incentivised our farmers to go for mixed cropping or move away from wheat and paddy have you ever studied why india is importing rs 10 000 cr of apple and rs 60 000 cr of palm oil every year because some other countries and their farmers have learnt to grow valuable quality crops with the economy of scale and at a lower cost to be able to export world over their people work harder on finding real practical solutions while i appreciate the current video request you to work a little harder than just compiling good data and a few interviews

3 agriculture census 2015 16 published in 2019 revealed that average size of land holdings in respective states of punjab and haryana is higher than the average size of national holdings and much higher than that of the state of up bihar odisha wb mp chattisgarh and other states who have greater dependency of population on agriculture sector for their subsistence therefore creates a condition which coupled with the assistance during the green revolution and resulting infrastructure and ecosystem favours the punjab farmers more to the farmers of other agricultural states in terms of production capacity volume automation supply on large scale and etc
in other part of the world this is called rioters while the next door called it they just expressing their freedom

the farmer you see draped in the flag was claimed to be shot dead by the police later they released a grainy footage via some cctv camera claiming innocence but they hid the fact that they had taken away the cctv from the premises where the shots were fired from that footage is still missing even the post mortem doctor told the relatives of the farmer that the injuries were consistent with bullet wounds but that they couldnt put their findings in writing and on record for obvious reasons
no one will tell this but that s truth

sikhs are known to protect the innocent they should not have done this but the bigger question is what raged them so much to take such an action i heard one nihang saying in punjabi that the man tried to insult there holy book joh video ye log nay beech meh say he kaat diya watch closely 1 37 to 1 42
i guessed some little common sense had to be knocked in president modi is hard head
so far farmers never resorted to violence as always there could be some infiltrators from the other side who have deliberately created a tense situation then acting saint which a kind of modus operandi adopted over many decades
be realist farmers are angry yes but why the hell anti social khalistani and tukde 2 gang posters are allowed can someone answer honestly why only punjab farmers are getting trapped in lies and fabricated fears how they know it is not good why farmers of rest of india have started benefiting from this law give atleast 1 2 years to see how effective or ineffective it is right now just blind assumptions presumptions illusions and misinformation by opposition and pseduo secular urban naxals nothing else govt already in talks but see arrogance no we dont want amendments but only repeal this law is introduced after weeks of discussion in parliament and those who are opposing now were supporting this why upa congress has it in their manifesto and their leaders endorsed this in parliament during their term now u turn meaning theyre eyeing punjab elections in 2022 as their middlemen they are rich with their kids settled abroad vote bank and money funding to state govt with lot of taxes etc that will get hit and farmers will directly get benefit with research and suggestions from farmers unions etc for months this came as law for benefit modi has been saying since 2016 17 that he wants to double farmer income by 2022
the ignorance of the oppressed is strength of the oppressor
well done people bless you all who stand for farmers and humanity
how the journey of success start
sikhs no longer stand at borders for india as you though but now you all know they stand at borders to protect punjab but if anyone gets past delhi it is indias own problem no khalistan problem the foreign investment for khalistan shall be the n ira billions as we have taken over the block chain and creating cryptos that will keep all banks and invaders at bay we are too smart for the world just ask britain government how very clever sikhs we build our wealth and now have the deepest pockets to take over economies and close them down

thnx bro got to know something which is useful
one or two states were given priority during the times of food shortage in india and these were punjab and haryana the system of commissions this agents and tax collected by the state i d not correct since this need not be supported by the central government and if so then all states have to be given similar status the fear that private traders would take advantage is too be volunteered by the farmers through collective bargaining and they can have these commission agents in their behalf also if farmers are happy with commission agents these people can themselves become the sole traders all said and done while government is coming out of public sector participation slowly evenin defence telephones power aviation etc it is not reasonable to ask central government to be the left purchaser of food grains ofcourse central and state governments would come to help farmers whenever there is a need since farming is the backbone of the country while every other states farmers go directly to markets and were happy when levy on rice mills were lifted his can these farmers have a different treatment even after decades politicised farmers are taking to bandhs in these difficult times giving based name to all farmers in general
that is good news for kashmiri people

who is kick out india from afghanistan
why cannot anurag thakur to do a goli maro roar on the farmers
the issue is not just related to msp it is something deeply rooted in what economists have been debating for more than 2 decades most of the indian farmers own 2 acres or less agricultural land there is no way you can improve the standard of living for these farmers if they work on farm alone the msp system coupled with the food subsidies help these farmers just survive nothing more economists want indian government to push these low acreage farmers out of farms and work into manufacturing and services sectors be it as a labourer in the upcoming factories being moved from china it hard to say who is being adamant here these farmers with a very low farm holding who will never be able to improve their standard of living with farming or the government that thinks moving them out of the farm will somehow accelerate the pace of manufacturing in india this is a problem where no one is wrong eventually and no one is right

by this pm ji shown that india is one for one state is foolishness whole india is willing to sacrifice their benefit that is why he repealed the law from whole india and not making it optional for one state but unfortunately their are people seeing political angle in this decision very unfortunate
this peasant movement will go down in history as a new trendsetter and will serve as a harbinger of a new era the indian farmers have now shown what they are capable of now let the workers and farmers of this and other countries must carry forward the struggle
but laws were good
why everyone is asking this question why farmers are protesting

in the contract farming there was also a loophole like if any businessman refuses to take purchase the contracted crop then who will take action that was in the hand of sdm of that area no farmer could go to court for that so that was totally blunder but with a few changes that law can provide a good benefits to the farmers
you are epitomizing what true journalism should be samdish bhaiya
god yet the farmers will still loose for a fair price who will be left in the hands of middlemen hoarders and corrupt politicians who will control the price the rest of the farmers of india were so happy that they got a better price for their crops and accepted the agricultural laws leaving only punjab farmers under pressure from middlemen and foreign funds to protest who were not even paying tax and controlled the price shame
can you please interview rajiwal as well
they absolutely have nothing to do other than blocking the roads and to stop country is development they are not farmers they are just unemployed people burning the country just to satisfy there own personal anger

why the gandhis fails to see writing on the wall the only votes congress was hoping to get was from the brahmins in up as they are disenchanted with bjp thanks to this incident they have enabled sympathies of the entire community to bjp whoever master minded it poor lives are lost on both sides
as long as the bjp can easily convert the votes of dalits bridesmaids chandalans and eezhavas into hindu votes in india ruled by ministers who proudly claim to be a non onion eating caste anti jihadi love laws will continue to prevail in india prohibition of notes gst amendment of citizenship for example most indians today have the rage common sense to say that everything is an arrangement to rehabilitate jihadists

congratulations our country is going 25 years back
on a lighter note the random validation of samdish at last juz made the video complete
and free market economics is not the best for small players but it will benifit the whole lot by avoiding dead weight loss
also most of small farmers dont go to govt mandis for msp they sell their crops to local vendors price they get way is more than msp msp can only benefit big farmers who put peoples on job for agriculture
your face shows that you have hidden agenda
they are only happening in panjab hariyans because of politics laws are correct and required so farmers can divert to other crops especially enable oil

obviously these so called reform bills will enhance the role by middlemen private traders which is prone to all exploitations of the poor indian farmers these so called reform bills will not decrease this evil role corruption by the wealthy middlemen traders which is well known in india therefore this is being falsely perpetuated by the govt that these reform bills will give more profits to the farmers as they will now be able to sell manage marketing of their produce across states even internationally at theor option of setting prices for the produce what a hoax and deception not realizing an absolute lack of the requisite threshhold of ability of indian farmers to do so
koi galat arth nahi nikala tum bjp wale ho hi aise insensitive and arrogant

ghar pe araam se bethoge to bhavishya accha nhi
couptaji is vindictiveness against namo is in full display even though he acknowledges that farm reforms are necessary he rejoices at their failure just because his masters are across the border he goes to the extent of almost terming his supporters as naive protestors have been raised to level of demigods no wonder his unscrupulousness has ensured his survival in cut throat world of journalism for so long
if we still pretend to be ignorant of the sanghee plutocrat agenda of pushing the farmers of this country to a death trap with the sole intention of snatching their land from their hands and transferring them to capitalist monopolies such as ambani and gang we are foredoomed to a collective failure as a democratic nation which is supposed to be the nation of the people for the people and by the people
now this is what happen when you fallow cheap designer media

the day you become a fan of a politician is the day you fail as a citizen
ok that comment at 3 28 is not correct there is no mention of withdrawal of government mandis in the bill please read the bill before making factual statements also note that the protests are primarily only in a single state there are no other protests against the bill all over india there are farmers in every state of the country the death rate mentioned by the report is largely from the other states not punjab which has a fraction of the total death rate if the bill was so bad this would be an all india movement instead of just one state as such the bill is good but the politics is bad which is what has led to this situation
farmer sports party bjp
if you listen to him properly over the years then you can easily find out that he has always been of the view that there is no military solution in afghanistan but at that time so called intellectuals of the western media did not bother to listen in fact they ridiculed him as taliban khan but today all the countries including the us with all its arrogance and might have agreed to the same conclusion that there is no military solution in afghanistan

bjp saying there are only a handful of farmers less than 20000 now they should know there are enough farmers to make them flee the country if they keep ignoring them and consider their calm as a weakness
modi backed down because the british government told him to at the cop26 summit sadly its the british that do all the positives for india and the negatives are supplied by themselves even to this day good luck farmers

so much respect to farmers
you are amazing love your frankness
see modi already admitted his mistake his laws will only widen the gap of the poor and the rich it is even makes the country controlled by big multinational companies at will
3 similar with dalilt
now that is for theory however on a realistic level what produce does the company hope to secure by offering 500 for something standardized at 2000 do they plan to disrupt their model and go out of business without the raw product so this 75 price reduction seems far fetched ultimately demand and supply forces balance things if companies offer 1500 and less farmers contract for that price leading to less supply demand rises and players emerge to offer more than 2000 now the company offering 1500 finds itself in a touch spot now with lost reliability and fewer contracts
now the laws are gone hope the farmers get their msp and govt take effort to make a fair law for consumers and farmers

govt is make fake propaganda that they want to eliminate the middle men who is a middle man any individual or any entity that connects the producer manufacturer one one side and end user consumer on the other side is a middle man therefore just as the commission agents are middlemen so are the big corporate houses that are into the trade business of farm products business is guided by greed but its the responsibility of the government to play neutral and bring forth rules and regulations that does not further the interests of one section large corporations at the interest of other sections farmers and commission agents
do not understand these creatures at all before they did not want them now they want to have discussion on it what a bunch of useless ppl sitting in that room

forgive us the wrong we have done as we have forgiven those who have wronged us
absolutely misguiding the example given that out of auctioned price of rupees 100 farmers gets only 10 in apmc is grossly wrong middleman i e commision agent is paid only a commission and other service charges thus essentially there is no middleman between trader and farmer in apmc traders being small and many there is no cartelization whereas as per new bill is it will be a monopoly on a burning issue every tom dick and harry starts opinioatating even if he has no first hand knowledge of the subject this man did exactly the same
think of development please take administrative reforms
he is running open goonism and blackmailing campaign he also went to support tmc the party which murdering hindus in bengal

now let us see what farmers pay to the government farmers pay rs 16 600 crore tax annually on purchase of pesticides rs 3800 crore on purchase of fertilizers rs 4 500 crore on purchase of tractors total of these taxes works out to rs 24 500 crore per anum in addition farmers pay about rs 10 000 crore on purchase of farm implements such as pumpsets micro irrigation systems etc then it can be seen that about rs 35 000 core is paid to the exchequers of states and central govt annually whereas central govt had been subsidizing farm sector to the tune of rs 1 20 000 crore only in addition respective states waive off farm loans to the tune of rs 200 000 annually

excellent video two points 1 contract farming could still be exploitive as the farmer bears the risk of reduced production and yet selling at lower than market price during surplus production quality clause is loophole that could be exploited by the buyers to avoid buying all the produce the farmer makes 2 the lack of legal validity of msp was supposed to be counterbalanced by a govt buyer the food corporation of india which is assured to be outside cartals because it is not a private entity the concept of govt owned corporation to break monopolies or cartels is used in some countries eg france and is anathema in others eg usa india belonged to former group with companies like bsnl fci ai etc existing to prevent monopoly and cartelization the current govt seems ideologically inclined towards dismantling this model
what do you expect from this bjp fraud all the way

90 percent of protesters are not actually farmers they r the brokers whose income will be put to ground and they r the once who exploit farmers the most like the rate per kg in mumbai for tomatoes is 54 but farmers get just 3 rs per kg can u imagine after modijis law all farmers can directly sell thier products at cost thats reasonable for them as well as us this guy is providing just half information
thanx sir great information
god bless you all the farmers
if the farmers were politically motivated then this political movement probably suffered most number of casualties in god knows how many decades
you know things are serious when amit shah himself comes to explain the situation in disguise

its a political order from high table
it is a blunder by the govt to assume and equate our indian farmer as to be an american farmer farmimg as an illustration in america unlike our nation bharat india there are few farmers with huge farming lands and privileged with requisite resources education computer tech logistics and above all america govt has obligatory provisions a binding by law of subsidies to the american farmers whereby american farmers have the built in inheirted capacity to act as private business themselves without any middlemen so to effectively economically manage their produce ensuring definite profit margins

watching this after those law have been repealed
next revolution are coming to remove the parliamentary democracy

this shameless opposition knows nothing other than disrupting the house last session they said no discussion only repeal the bill today when government conceded their demands and come forward to repeal the bill they want discussion fact is that they have nothing to discuss their only goal is to disrupt the house

this is a act which is done by rss everyday
free
instead of tackling the myriad problems of the apmc system these acts only aggregates and accentuate these its akin to replacing a lesser evil with a greater evil when the government does not even want to guarantee in the form of a law the msp on wheat and paddy what can be said of the other produce
the guy who hit the police with the indian flag should be shot without any mercy they might be farmers if they do not have respect for government it is kk but if they do not respect for the country and it is flag they should tamed they should be killed without hesitation which makes it clear that no one is above the nation being a farmer is not an excuse for disrespecting and disgracing the national flag nation pride
misgoverment is reason for divide
do you wish to be famous wealthy and powerful be part of this elite organization called the illuminati brotherhood filled with world leaders business authorities artists and be given 500 000 usd as your monthly benefit and also be given a new house of choice reply me by saying yes if interested
good move because khalistani and anti indian elements were trying to make inroad in the shield of farm laws
by farmers he means mlas and mps who cultivate garbage so the nation can rot and be disposed to globalised forces
while keeping in mind the welfare of the whole country 3 agricultural laws should be implemented
and all are either farmer is brothers or their sons
the fundamental issue of the protesting farmers is that almost 99 of indian farmers do not have adequate requisite resources education internet computer tech knowhow of paper document works and logistics etc to enjoy the privilege of selling their products across states and even international markets selling their products overseas through shipments this is the basic q that would need to be weighed in and answered now by the govt
sell their products
to think that this protest represents the will of the poor farmers is absolutely immoral
very nice brother
these laws were passed in a hurry without proper parliamentary procedures and debates and the whole india has seen that
thank you a lot
so yeah if there are kids in your family please give them a written explanation as to why you rejoiced when the farm laws were pulled back because when they grow up sir they will laugh at me and they will laugh at you for the show we have put together as a democracy and have jeopardized their future jai hind

my advice is that some corona patients are to be asked to mingle without masks etc and let them cough in the meet so that these thugs get corona and die it is all because of stupid judgement of sc permitting protest in fact it is sc which is encouarging anarchy and the judges are responsible for the protests remember when eci can be charged for murder of people under criminal law by a stupid temarks of a hc and sc asking eci to take it in correct spirit let the judges of sc by allowing protest from anarchists is also equally guilty in the cell inject coro a to yogendra and other anarchists who are acting for pharma lobby and chinese spies in india

lets all agree on one thing at the end its all power game to win it one needs money whether you accept or not there is religious politics going on at global level many are pushing this agenda only three religions are there max hindu lives here in india already indonesia and srilanka nepal and bangladesh afghanistan almost converted and occupied except india nothing is left hope you agree on this second thing whoes money is more powerful indian rs or dollars who are rich third thing who can be easily divided both xtian and xlims are strong they have global provisions but hindus are easy target with many divisions and can be easily easily targetted phase 1 is completed to introduce divisions among people etc for you knowledge lot of funds are sent for these activities through ngos how they want to occupy first stop development second increasse poverty thrid create fear through bombs drugs and other things fourth illegal migrants who work for them goonda giri killings etc what this results in people like you and me flew away no one will be left owning this land easy to dominate and say this is our land over time rest will also flew away now khongress lead by outsiders they dont have anything to take or give with india they tied up hands with all those who are in for it looted amount fromindia through many fake ngos and companies created on kahul baba and allowed whatever they asked for and didnt even care for developing india once they get funding dont you think getting an activist to post for an amount is easy they can even get anyone to make their stand stronger party or anyone for that matter who take stand with hindus dont have any agenda they dont have any global funding watever they do its just to stop these tsunami so that we stay within our control and we have our own rights in todays world very very difficult to get a person who dont get sold for all these things its easy job if you see bjp dont and cant involve in such corporate butchering other than depending on ambani and adani they cant ask funding as well missionaries and xlims are getting huge funding from halal and missionary funds hindus have no fund to fight all temple funds are being routed to governaments just understand the game they are playing and make yourself educated on whatshappening with and around you dont be a fool jai hind

agree with most points but still modi government will come out unscathed
this presstitude has low iq
congress bad
depsite the firs there are no arrests for bjp leaders ministers or their sons as demanded by the farmers and opposition leaders the reason behind this due to majority of bjp leaders are accused in criminal cases rapes and murders including the cm yogi also accused in 20 year old murder case and even the pm modi is accused of behind the brutal killing by lynching of ehsan jaffri congress mp in 2002 and the case is still going on in supreme court and the next hearing against the pm modi is on 18th october 2021 therefore it is impossible for the bjp govt to arrest all of the bjp leasers as almost all are accused in so many cases that is the reason supreme court of india said jungle raj prevails in uttar pradesh in 2019 and also in madhya pradesh in 2021

fir your kind information panchayat muzaffarnager mai huyi hai
so the government screwed up they had a good rationale but instead of consulting they pushed the reforms and when somebody protested they started calling them anti national and causing lasting damage perfect recipe for destroying a good thing if that is what the farm bills are ca not think of a more dumb execution
first option of corporates entering farms business looks main reason
unfortunately our ias officials and some political leaders also who prepare such attractive blueprints of so called reform bills have no idea of poverty lack of resources want of education want of computer internet technology lack of logistics paper documents works with our indian farmers therefore our indian farmers unlike american farmers are not at the requisite threshold of managing marketing of their produce by themselves inevitably under the circumstances our agro marketting is successful as totally dependent on our govt agencies existing system of mandikaran however in implemnting the so called new reform bills would be distrous as it will open all possible corrupt avenues for the private traders middlemenn with all the wealth perhaps even black money at their disposal who will rob the farmers and thereby kill the nation because today the govt is able to have full control on procurement of the produce and storage of the surplus produce and its regulated distribution across the needy population of the country as well as regulating the exports and even free donation to the needy world therefore in india unlike america as an example discussed above in here with these new so called reform bills of management of agro produce it is definitely aimed at welcoming private middlemen traders to buy and sell the produce which would definitely rob deprive the farmers of profits and that would kill the nation as well because our nation india bharat is comprised of smaller land holdings but by a huge population of small farmers who do not have the requisite threshhold to enable them to act become private businessmen in managing marketting their produce without middlemen either govt agencies or private traders our agro marketting is surviving because of an intensive infrastructure of procurement storage distribution in place with setting of price by the govt farmers feel secure with the govt agencies in marketing aspects of their produce while in case of private traders no one could secure our huge populace of small farmers with smaller holdings and small produce at respective individual farmer level only god will save the poor farmer and poor india as for as gdp is concerned if a major population of a nation farmers are robbed then forget about gdp growth curves called reform system system will be robbed by middlemenn instead i may be allowed to reemphasize a repetition of a paragraph above in here viz

babaji plese make an analysis on how much it takes to produce 1kg of rice or wheat in india after getting all kinds of subsidy still rice wheat etc in india is not competitive in international market
if the main issue is providing msps to rice n wheat that resulted in the market surplus why do not the govt assure msps and increasing procurement more of other produce like vegetables oilseeds pulses etc so that the farmers will not be exploitated at the hands of corporate morons

i m not against or for the laws but i think you must make a video explaining in detail the complete law as i can see is that you had done pick and choose of only parts which look negative i m sure there must be protection given to farmers which no body is explaining initially the series was well explained about the green revolution but as it came down to laws it seems to be biased
it is not shaking anyone do not spread fake news

change the headlines congress support middle men their party men agitation do not spoil original farmers names they are doing farming in their land ndtv please respect original farmers
if government servants are paid salary on the basis of their productive output then they will surely agitate like the punjab farmers farmers want secure fixed income which msp ensures land reforms act of every state prohibits holding and cultivation of agricultural land by corporate entity hence cultivation of staple crops vegetables fruits on economic scale cannot be achieved small holding will continue unless co operative farming is further strengthened and professionally managed
the farmers are right and the gov and agri companies are wrong and only interested in their profits disband these agri corporations they are ruining our health and environment

oh boy educated unaware people like these are exactly the problem india faces read the bill
there is msp on most crops but farmers can only sell 2 crops on msp right now
farm laws are indeed a big good thing for farmers surprisingly the well to do farmers in punjab and haryana want status quo to continue farmers from other states do see a huge benefit from farm laws the left elements and opposition have been very good at enhancing the confusion since this issue is happening in the mid term it is not going to influence 2024 elections unnecessarily they are robbing the farmers from escalating to new heights in the field of agriculture
they r not farmers shoot them

farmers protest have been one of the major spreader of coronavirus in delhi media doesnt cover it since it doesnt fit their narrative
proud of the farmers of this country the farmers of this country has sacrificed their and their family welfare for the middlemen of punjab and haryana because 80 percent of msp money has been bagged by farmers of these two states only and other state farmers are anyway at the mercy of unorganised sector buyer now these other state farmers can not get access to corporate money and technology to uplift i bow down to their selfless sacrifice

ravish kumar jii plz telecast about railway exams
we will go further we will attack we will win
they themself have no fear of the law they are supposed to implement
this enactment basically can alter the intended purpose of msp which is to provide a safety net and can make the msp as a price floor such intervention can deleterious for the agricultural sector as putting up a price floor reduces the quantity demanded significantly the buyers of the produce of the farmers will not be interested to buy at such a high price regardless of how much the farmers would like to sell a lower quantity of the produce will be purchased this further creates an obligation over the government to purchase all the produce at the msp price as the demand is killed by such price floor in place hence pumping the fiscal deficit such move will effectively take away a chunk of total surplus of producers and sellers and will be against the free markets working
ye fir rone wala hai
it is duty not a favour at all

i think agriculture supply chain will be modernized and farm produce will increase if the company and farmers do contract farming
price msp of rs 2 902 per quintal for paddy as calculated by the punjab agriculture university
relaince more or spencers or big basket have their farm lands and supply vegetables and fruits at low in their marts fresh and quality hence these agriculture bills not for benefit to indian marts i think its international supply chain management mostly to indonesia or eastafrica or iran or iraq modi is interest always exterior regions where people under run of ngos whether doing for good for them but blaming indians are all rich farmers
pm modi is initiating the game of tug of war between the farm laws supporters and farm laws opposers since it has not been repealed fully the modi led government shall go whose side wins the game of tug of war on farm laws in the coming time this issue is in supreme court modiji is very clever i respect your decision if these farm laws are good then supporters of these farm laws should start agitation against government s desicion to repeal it back
bhalle tare modi how u feel now modi u r nothing without people
seriously are you hiring writers from star plus daily soaps

farmers agitation will prove a final blow to the enemies of democracy
initially in punjab free electricity to farmers was limited to those with 5 or less acres but as the rich farmers lobby is the dominant political group free electricity was extended to all farmers without any limit of their landholding
how many of these kisans are crorepati why do not the journalists ask this question to farmers participating in mahapanchayat
people of this country doesnot want new reforms sadly we dont have guts to take risk we hate corporates but want to use their tax money and their product

why you guys do not make more areal view footage
they want to sell all the farmers land to cooperates so that the monopoly will be developed in return the cooperates will make the farmers slaves
unfortunately if the farm laws that were beneficial to the real farmers were not brought in propagandists and critics would have attacked the govt if their vested interests were not satisfied unfirtunately the fourth pillar of democracy is resorting to propaganda newsfare to benefit others but not the country
thank you mam but today your energy was low
modi does not have the resolve and raw guts
still bjp through out from india
purely behind election issue

it is important that the south of vindhyas is informed about the details of the farm bills and how they are going to harm the farmers interests while the country is vast it is necessary that the sizeable southern part is not left uninformed there seems to be little awareness in the states of ap karnataka and tamilnadu or even in kerala in telangana cm kcr is repeatedly announcing that his government wont implement the new farm bills as they go to harm the interests of farmers excepting this there is little commotion in southern states generating opinion in southern states will be an important element for the success of farmers country shall speak with one voice or else there will be doubts about the reasons and motives of the movement
the free market would not
well can this be the speech of a prime minister i wonder his speech however truly exhibits his chaewala origin modi is suo moto action instantaneous declaration is completely a mismatch to the basic tenet of democracy both in terms of government duty peoples rights which are the primary to any democracy consider for example the three farm acts were introduced unilaterally taken back following the same route modi is allegiance to democracy had always been next to zero though modi initially claimed to be a post graduate overnight the issue became a polemic one but after much controversy confusion the issue finally settled down to primary school dropped out this duality of his character duality of being a blocked illiterate religious fanatics in one hand insatiable lofty yearning to become i am the monarch of all i survey dictator forced him to commit insurmountable mistake one after another leading to erosion decay in every physiognomy of our motherland social cultural political economic education administrative all spare none damage done by modi will require decades to recover
republic of india is not so republic anymore
if watching this does not make you cry what will
we shud never forget this atrocities by bjp we shud build a shahid memorial on all 3 borders with names of all farmers who died in these protests please spread this word
a clear trap farmers or public do not fall for this it is all for the upcoming election gimmick let is not put them to power again
bottom line is indian politicians and bureaucrats are all sellouts to the western hegemony big tech big pharma and the globalists
indians have little work to do so they all do politics this talk is also obsessed with political fallout of annulling the farm laws rather than the long term consequences on indian agricultures future modernization of farming practices how will indian agriculture produce be competitive on global scale
all farmers are very awared and full of knowledge and bjp says they cannot understand the bills

the economists argue that a farmer can sell his produce anywhere in india but is it possible for a farmer to ferry his produce from state to state in the hope of a better price i think the economists are more obsessed with flip kart and amazon like platforms but that does not work for perishable goods

very barbarism against farmer and labour as both come under new labour law and total control agenda of new metternich2 0 of2020 when contract farming is propagated in developing countries then farmer is consider as labour only and all labour laws and criminal acts will applies on both easily hence the common man only filmstars media religious authority and ministers are the exception and will feed on the hard work and labour of common public this will be proved as end of democracy system in next five years only this will not be a proven system as it only a devil is rule over humanity not liked by nature and against the law of nature and harmony of mankind specialy poor and weakers very sad

government should not listen to these non sense these leaders representing the farmers are really pampered politicians government should stop giving subsidies and msp and use the money for something productive like healthcare education infra etc if a rickshaw puller does not get enough customer government does not come at the end of the day to take a ride to make up for that loss why then government do that for farmers idolizing farmers have got us nowhere we have to realize it is just another business you own land pay tax proper tax commensurate with the farmland value like other property taxes not the tiny amount they are paying now produce compete if you gain then again pay income tax that is how it should be if you cannot then give up your land there are other people who know how to make good use of it government should nationalize entire land area of this country then keep some aside for infrastructure keep some aside for industries and auction the remaining land to leasing basis for 5 years periods that is the only way to solve a lot of problems in this country

thanks newslaundary
promoted and funded by pannun  why dont you highlight that  how he is demanding farmers to separate punjab under the pretext of protest who are you making fool  media can lie then mr what is the authenticity of your videos please show both sides of the coin we all know how indias unity is under threat because of this protest  but keep making such idiotic videos to pump the protest
you are not completely correct akash protesting does work but not if you are part of a certain minority community the farm leaders were not jailed those who spoke in their support were not jailed and charged with sedition look at what happened during the caa protests had it not been for covid many of them would have been killed or in jail the leaders of the anti caa movement are in jail charged with sedition with no hope or discussion from the liberals to release them on bail there are indeed two indias one for the minorities and one for the majority

how remarkably allama iqbal prophesied
great day for democracy government acted in accordance with citizens demands
actually they are finished they dont care about farmers but they think they can seek some votes
if the second scenario is the case than it will send a false message about the actual market because good prices to the farmers means good demand in market which will inturn attract more people to do farming and than government have to spend even more to procure these products and because of demand and supply disbalance the procured product will just rot in the storage bins i e rotting of our tax money

the seasonal spikes in the prices of onions and vegetables have had a causal link to the hoardings noticed during various state elections a viewpoint that can be seen echoing on the social media is that the laws bode ill not just for the farmers but also for the consumers the aam janta who will have to buy food at the prices that the big corporates decide to charge since they have the capacity to store the stock for very long and create shortage in the market they will be legally allowed to hoard food grains and other stuff

and so called farmers protester want msp
such biased opinions are recorded and presented here most of the people who answered are mis informed first of all farmers of punjan and haryana do not represent farmers of entire india secondly laws have to be changed with changing times you can expect laws of 1950s to justify financial conditions of govt now ask farmers to pay tax and i am fine with everything farmers are doing a job just like any other person farmers are not doing social service farmers should not be compared to armed forces of india
respected sir in depth analysis
most of the people think the farmers are only from punjab and haryanawhat about the 95 of the farmers from the rest of indiasocialism has won not the democracy
nonetheless it is clearly a move for votes in upcoming elections
annahazare one man protested media is gave most imparts now formers protest but indian media is sleeping too

no governnment can buy all agricultural produce in a country or control price eventually market system has to exist currently govt just buys few food grains on msp for public distribution system which benefitted punjab and haryana farmers this system will continue but farmers are misled by few special interest group and political parties
repealed under protest
i modi keeping in mind the up elections in march taking back the farm law is back nothing for public benefit
nicely expalined sir
the people reading this
he is the real culprit but he will be shield by the govt because he is minister s son
shame on chairman for passing the bill without any discussion
25 minutes he kept questioning his behaviour not discussing the real issues of anti farmer bills pathetic anchor
how does milk is related to msp misleading
prof gulati says prof modiji could nt convince farmers of the reforns its difficult to believe because prof modiji it appears had written and publised a book exam warriors for students appearing for exams on how to control stress and examination fear
didi i need speech on farmers protest for my school compitition
i have seen many videos on youtube explaining the farm law like water with all merits and demerits and read some pdfs also but did not got any proper video of the arguments of the perticular section of farmers as mentioned by modiji i think this things are purely political and far above good and bad but this repealing will encourage many such protest in future may be more aggressively and violently
is it free of cost to study on drishti app
to the fisrt expert i would jst say that the situation will be better than today so if u are comparing the famers of usa with india u should also look at the quality of life if something better can be done than u should give the road map rather than just criticizing it
we are with farmers

while state and center elections are happening i think while people are casting their vote they should have options yes no related to state and center rules that state is trying to impose on state and center is proposing country and to pass any bill state or center 50 should be considered from people of india and 50 from the elected representatives mla mp this way we can consider direct input of republic of india and issues like farmers bills and article 370 and some of the state levels bills can be handled better also all parties should think of their bills and proposals part of their agenda ahead of time and stick to it unless some emergency situations like natural disaster and covid 19 related situation arrives for which we may not be able to plan before election juts an idea
congress desperately looking for miracle
pepole beat 3 4 person with weapons nd killl them
finally farmers win
but indian national media is spreading fake news against farmer corruption we respect the sikh
those are note farmers they are khalistani
after so many explanations and good will by the government even to the extent of witholding the laws for the next 18 to 24 months it is sad to see some in india hell bent on disgracing the government there is no respect by the farmer for the nation just a group of debauchers

why afgan army is so lame omg
farmers protest is no use learn from naxalite to guard your rights
since agriculture is a state subject states should have been taken into confidence centre has encroached state is jurisdiction though at present msp is being continued there is a scope for it is end which endangers farmers interests though the objective of the bills is said to be elimination of middlemen namaste indeed small middlemen would be replaced with huge corporate houses which means centralization scope to form syndicate and dictate terms meanwhile large number of so called middlemen render jobless and thrown into poverty i e amassing wealth by a few individuals repealing essential service commodities act or removing food grains is a great harm to public it gives traders huge scope to create artificial scarcity and hoard fleecing public money i m sighting horrible future and terrible exploitation
ground journalist and anchor in tv studio go to modi and ask

america put taliban in power
the farmers should not come under modi words he is a liar liar he want only vote 
how will you be able to sleep what are you giving to your kids money from china by letting your own country down
irony prof modi who wrote the book exam warriors to help students appearing for the exams failed to convince agriculture scientists like tikait
waah good from now on in india commit any crime say that you are farmer they wont arrest you even though if they arrest contact tikait offer him a good amount he will come with his protest gang and will make you get released without even going to court from now i guess this trend will continue and even rakesh tikait will make it as a business as he is earning good amount
whenever middlemen are reduced markets will prosper

all subsidies are bad economics but it makes sense to subsidize essential commodities like food not to mention most farmers cannot simply find another job if they are unable to produce profitable crops on a free market msp also protects farmers from being exploited by private corporations who would love to redefine the meaning of minimum prices
this not the right time pass this kind of act this bill pass by listening voice viting ooy or no when some people start opposing thay were not listened and they were suspended
india is separation of state and church is clearly non existent as hindu extremist run the country

bjp is now bigger than india a bjp pm can say that indians were ashamed of showing an indian passport but you cannot criticize bjp
farmer is leaders lost their identity by these 3 bills benefited to farmers m s p must be announced as early done
government is more concerned about it is earning risking people is livelihood and their hard earned money
farmers of our country will live poorly and the people that are here to support this the bill was to commercialize farming so that investment could be done and the tools that farmers of our country have could be mordenized for example combiners and harvesters provided to farmers ob the companies expense
this is only possible in my country india i m proud in i am indian

only farmers can unite us again irrespective of religion
indian government same
haryana punjab especially are going to be heavily impacted but instead of slowly assuring farmers about the laws and properly consulting about it listening to what they want the way they hurried and passed this bill and labeled every protestor as a terrorist you can see where this is leading up to
those who support these protect first study farm law before commenting or supporting any side no one open eye last 70 year when farmers doing mass sucides because there is no reform now reform is here why protect
may rest peace his soul
your all the points are accepted by the government of india the protest is going on

pm has regrettably given into the andolan jeevis and it is regrettable the egg is on his face now what ever political expediency derived out of it will be a small gain compared to emboldening the break india forces and their agents with their workable tactics the losers are the poor farmers and the credibly of the government if they wanted to relent he could have left it with the states to take it up or not
this is nt cleared about 3 laws
delhi police should be prepared because their intentions are always to destroy public places take revenge in any of the form

making of a big leader in bjp by honourable chief minister saab

congress knows ndtv and other pappu media dose not have any article on bjp just few have
taliban was lucky due to pakistan locates between both country

police attacking protesters is not a clash please stop the disinformation channel 4
kangana route will be embraced by the farmers family who died in this protest so sad 700 farmers killed afsoos politics
society management clarified the lift is available to all but the gentlemen who wanted to use the donkeys could still do it but no the agitation continued and so finally the new management had to succumb to the pressure
comparing flipkart fpo is etc as middlemen is disingenuous
bjp government is not interested in resolving the farmers issue the demands of farmers are simple but are critical for farmers survival the government should not feel embarrassed or feel defeated in accepting the demands of the farmers the bjp feels still there are many farmers who support the government and the majority hindu population are with them and will vote the party to power again
mostly we are taken along the rss propaganda that this man will do this will do that which are completely false because what he is up to they certainly do not know and they woven many false but good dreams for which he is not at all interested
arvind kejriwaal is the next pm nodoubt
problem is only with punjab and hariyana but other state farmers are happy if they are disrespecting my country and our police then all over india we should start boycotting agri products from punjab and hariyana
just 2 days back our nsa had made a statement about modern warfare and how our civil society is being used we are in a state of war but not conventional one

it literally is irrelevant if the leader is male or female

there were atleast 60000 tractors on delhi roads and many more were doing tractor rallies is local area of punjab haryana and other states of india there will be more than 3 lakh tractors on 26th january and it will be largest tractor rally in the world it will be answer for godi media who were saying against farmers
it is a biggest insult of god
it is like i come to murder you but then decide to spare you under obvious reasons of course as a birthday gift
so called farmers khalistani have fallen in their own trap now the khalistanis anti modi anti national elements expected that govt police will not give them permission then they will create nuisance and then there will be blood bath and after then delhi police will take action against them then they will put forward innocent uneducated farmers which they have incited and brought here in delhi and they will run away and blame delhi police govt after that but modi govt is two steps ahead from all anti national elements like u u all anti national elements have lost your credibility faith

govt is rolling back farm laws but reforms should not be stopped
modi bjp will not get votes even if withdrawal of three black bills modi bjp has lost it is credibility in india bjp a failure party and modi is a nonsense pm of india
sdm must be shacked forever bcz himself bound to follow constitution and law order unfortunatly has brokened the law
do not agree with aim is analysis agriculture is a state subject bjp states will slowly start implementing the farm laws in their states
skm should contest election directly
modi government is treating farmer as terrorist
congress 70 year rule nothing nada 0 for india farmers lives they did not built warehouse for storage for rice and wheat for 70years his speeches are fear mongering tactics and lies modi farm bill is to protect the farmers income minimum set price for farmers produce will expose con t rest tricks
this is how an educated politicians play politics
at the same time he must ensure that the sacredness of the house is being maintained
the law should cover head load goons in kerala for bleeding the farmers

it is first hard for a non influential farmer to file his complaint even if he does it is not easy to get justice along with that he has to face violence threat if he is challenging a person who is extremely powerful because of his influence on other people

1 companies can lure the farmers for contract farming resulting in excessive use of pesticides and promoting mono cropping which is bad for the ecosystem as well as fertility of soil
bjp will be banished in 2024 for sure

newslaundry wale bataenge bc
why do not think like if all the farmers work as single unit and pledge not to sell to this companies then what will the company is going to do instead of protesting as unit on the laws which are beneficial to the farms they have to utilise them in proper way you are just saying about the one side of the coin who said to go only to the private companies when you do not trust there are apmc mandi which are available they can sell it there too after these laws and everybody is appreciating what he is telling like goats this is why india is still a developing country with this kind mindset and influencing people with this kind of mind set is not good

i have the feelings that amrinder singh has misled modi ji in believing there is big khalisthani and isi infiltration in punjab corrupting punjabi youths there might be some truth in but this has made modi ji to take this drastic step to repeal three farms bill is opening the doors for others to create troubles the security of the nation is the most important looking at hindsight modi ji should have acted immediately after the criminals disrespected the 26 january hurting many of our policemen modi ji softer approach on gadhars khalisthani leftists backed farmers leaders has made them feel that they can get away with murders modi ji should have stopped the funds coming into these goons criminals khalisthani farmers

if anyone thinks farmers protest been success he will be the no 1 fool it is purely political gimmick upcoming elections and their recent failures have paved way for the withdrawal success we yield when the fascism bites the dust in the up and punjab elections
it is been a year
blinded eyes are now see farmer easily its called farmer protest

all president is and prime minister s are terrorist now days i am job less team
farmers will protest and ready to die because it is said to die once in honour is more worthy than die daily out of fearmustbe clear to mo sh rulers because bjp was on ventilator in icu since 2014 when seniors were packed in decadent mandal
stop defending the whole act with your stupid incorrect historical facts
loss now the farmer will sell that rest 60 quintal to any private businessman they take just 40 to 45 below than msp the same product so at that place farmers occur a huge loss
this is real hindu who support farmers 
the audio has been terrible please improve it was very important part of news which went mute
government want to become middleman trader what a greedy corrupt official
why only in opposition ruled states formers are against the farm laws are these governments are conspiring to project modi in bad light are trying to force him to resign the more these crooks oppose modi the leads there is chance for them to win in 2024
shame on center government
who here wants their children to be a farmer if you do not why not support reforms just because you do not like modi lol typical pre industrial third world peasant mentality
what happened that day is an expression of dissent by the farmers who have been peacefully protesting for 2 months and losing their loved ones amid cold and covid almost 150 farmers died in the protest the government passed the laws amid covid and declared postponing it just days prior to republic day for their reputation they care less for the farmers and more about their image police clearly fired unprovoked tear gases to the peaceful protestors and the whole mess began thats a ground report protestors were seen distributing water bottles to police and protecting female police from the chaos yes they hoisted their sikh faith flag but whats wrong with that the national flag was way up higher and untouched and the sikh faith flag is a reminder of the dissent of farmers who have heard zero response from their democratic prime minister about the farm law protests since day 1 as if pretending the country is well and stablilised guess what the government stopped slowed internet services in the capital to prevent the authenticity of the day get out
this is the development vikas indians voted for wanted
thank you for your coverage
i tried to pay 3 times atleast some issue with google pay link on theprint page
i am sad to comment this reforms in so many issues are pending for example rape cases are increasing money laundering is increasing custodial deaths are increasing and many more why cannot stringent laws be implemented and girl child be protected with new ammendments and forcefully implied with immediate effect
this is due to indian judges and judiciary are very corrupted in world they dont work for county they work for personal benefits and money even worst than politicians from 1947 they only work for rich and corrupt politicians thats reason ordinary public never trust on any courts hence corruption and crime increases in india courts only open for rich and powerful mafia politicians and terrorist never get justice ordinary public
dear youtube this video shows the true face of ndtv all this time they ran shows on why govt must repeal the farm laws and now when they are repealed they want them back because many of these news anchors at ndtv have to create a new fiction for their bread and butter they were not prepared for this surprise move
u r against or with

arvind kejriwal will be next pm of india
very good thanks to the farmers
only came here for comment
media has lost all integrity in face of reporting truthfulness
sukhbir agro of sukhbir singh badal had an income of at least 5000 crores annually he was the commission agent between fci and farmers his company used to get 2 5 commission all the warehouses belonged to him no farmer could sell even a kg of wheat to the fci without the tag of sukhbir agro
charge per transaction thro markets will loose 1000 crores 10000
back ground music bohot achha tha godi media hai hai
excellent governance web need cm like kenjrewal in all over india
very bad treatment with farmers
if the police tanter have been honest then any criminal person can not become politician
the real farmers went back to there villages these are brokers and there bonded labourers
this is total lie
common man is indian legal system is a joke
judiciary taking refrence of it was all over godi media shows what a leash bitch of goverment they have actually become the apex court needs to be reminded that they exist for protecting rights of citizens including right to protest detest laws not governments
these cops are also humans they tried their
yeh bill unconstitutional nhi thy he is just manipulating people
bilkul sahi kisan must reunite prepare and fight a final war against this arrogant government of two gundas
we support modiji we support bjp only who can take india to a new horizon
you knw what is the major problem with the farm bills no talk with farmers side and now when there are some conflicts are coming from the farmers side government try to modify it sometime on air sometimes on paper thats is good but this makes this farms bils prepared in bits n pieces this issues will never come if a core team of farmer involves in talk read the first lines
you r right sir
understand how we are progressing at a large scale under narendra modi
you make large statement you do not want reform to happen you just want to sabotage efforts of the government the high and mighty section do not need this reform it is the marginal poor farmer who is crushed under the current pattern
according to religious history of sikhs and muslims they never want to fight but if someone troubles them a lot they they never leave him
maaf karne ka sawal hi nahi atta doosri or rahul uchak raha hai both trying to score political points the voters should reject both outright it is a victory of the farmers by the farmers and for the farmers
so basically just because the 2 states wont make high profit by unnecessary charges they want to withdraw the law and affect the millions of farmers from the rest of 27 states
amazing that u put such a huge protest into a three minute long clip and give it a political color it seems the only platform to carry out a protest is twitter which you guys applaud when dickheads trend bantwitter on twitter if u do not have the balls to stand with the farmers due to some vested interests then atleast do not oppose them either and bring the entire protest to bad light
mam you are clearly saying that his men were in the car not he why u guys put false title to videos was not expecting from ndtv atleast
my biggest mistake in life is voting bjp and this modi came to power daily i pray to god when this modi amith shah will go from power or from world
its the duty of speaker lok sabha and chairman rajya sabha to ensure that the law being passed repealed is according to the explicitly as well as implicitly embedded provisions of the constitution
lesson from this video

in my experience american we still have the same kind of issue w our politicians learning from the past to avoid the same failures seems unobtainable how did we go from the league of nations to marshall plan and then backwards to whatever it is that the us has been doing the last 20 30 years
it is been done by ankit das cousin of congress mp akhilesh das
kissan morch zindabad the victory came after a year of struggle and hundreds of death salute to all my kissan brothers bjp saw up being lost with all their calculations that is why this repeal came they will still lose up elections and will lose loksabha elections too just wait n watch this is just one step victory for kissan they have lot more to achieve

this only shows one thing that this government is for inclusiveness and of democracy it listens and behaves with each and every section of society
the correct solution would have been amendments in the law
good information
one argument against the msp is that it causes an imbalance in the cropping pattern because it tempts the farmers to grow only the crops that offer them good returns this argument is a classic case of putting the horse before the cart see it like this punjab is not a land suited for rice and yet this is happening because there is no msp on the crops that it can better handle if the government declares and enforces msp on every crop then punjab and haryana are more likely to shift to oilseeds and other cash crops declaring an msp is the only way of ensuring a balanced cropping pattern
ca not trust his word until everything on writing biggest liar in universe

this is not done i m very disappointed by modi ji what the benefit of having 300 seats and still you cannot implement the bills on ground this set a example of any group people can come together and oppose any bill block roads and pressurise government to revoke that bill so what the benefit of having power are those bills were wrong than why earlier you support those bills and argued on very stage i do not think there is any benefit of having a majority government anymore
it is not for former protest it is preplanned agenda to seperate country in the name of kalistan bloody dogs
i belongs from a higher class family

people who have never read the farm bill have suddenly become experts and activists lol

not good yet the farmers will still loose for a fair price who will be left in the hands of middlemen hoarders and corrupt politicians who will control the price the rest of the farmers of india were so happy that they got a better price for their crops and accepted the agricultural laws leaving only punjab farmers under pressure from middlemen and foreign funds to protest who were not even paying tax and controlled the price shame

jai jwan jai kisan but border seal krna is not good for this country
it is a bluff from government they will bring it again m loving the game
msp procurement happens in 23 states for paddy and 12 states for wheat and it is the ignorance of tikait and his paid leaders in other commodities marketable surplus is not there skm is not demanding inclusion of maize in bihar mp jowar mh bajra rajasthan mandua uttrakahand in pds system bcoz it will affect the procurement of wheat and paddy in haryana and punjab
the problem is that in most cases msp is the highest price farmers can get bihar does not have apmc act see the condition of bihar is farmer working as a labor in another state maharashtra does not have farmer suicide in maharashtra is common in india leaders only think about consumers not about farmers when production increases cost of the potato onion etc becomes very low govt generally does not interfere when the opposite happens govt stops export reduce import duty to check the cost in both cases farmers are the only sufferer why these farm laws do not fix the minimum support price they want to allow private entities why they are not saying that private entities will not be able to buy the product below the minimum support price why they are allowing private entities to stock the farming product they want that agriculture has to follow the market rules fine why do they stop export and reduce import duty when the cost of rice potato es etc starts to rise that is also a market rule
people you see at 2 34 do those kids even have a future other than that people from this community even had a police officer hand cut just because he asked them not to roam in lockdown they just want the world is attention so they can show they are mistreated and spread more hatred in the country
very rong police
modi government kam se zyada publicity aur image banane mein desh ke 8sal barbad kar diya they are experts in divide in the name of religion spread hate and riots not in governance
taliban is obviously internally allies with pakistan this drama is to make world believe that pakistan never supported taliban but it was actually opposite

sudhir chaudhary totally biased ho zee news dekhna hi chd dia watch ndtv and news24 then use ur brain
the government shut down the internet and started arresting protestors illegally thats why there is no recent footage please bring awareness
in the present situation middle men are eating most of the money of farmers since dey buy agriculture goods for very low price and sell it fa higher but according to new bill he can sell it directly to corporates fa higher prices but the thing is msp should be continued even in the covid condition agriculture gdp is 4 6 where as other sectors are in negatives giving better pricing for the farmers produce would bring miracles in agriculture there are pros n cons whatever but farmers have to b benifitted
this is so bogus and hillarious the question that now that modi repeal the 3 stupid laws now bjp can now think of coming back in punjab asi fuddu ni haige sanu pta eh modi ne laws kyun repeal kite ne eh te hun jadd tak bjp ton eh 3ne 4re modi yogi te amit shah jadd tak naak ragardh ke vi mafi ni mang lete udon tak te punjab vich bjp nu koi ni aan dinda jehra punjab chon bjp nu vote deve te baiyye da khoon hai eh jatt di ulaad tan na hogi

u are foolish when 1991 act come for increasing economy private companies come even they give employment to many people but salary is very low in the same way farmer will get less than msp rate if new rule come the best example is bihar today bihar farmers exploited thats why they are leaving bihar and are going to other states for labour work because they follow this new system from many years

p s i am a supporter of the current central government
modi is the smartest politician in this country right now with farmer bill and eventually taking it back he has released pressure of caa nrc now nobody gives a dame about it and farmers are also relaxed
this is a welcome relief elderly farmers were doused by water hoses last year in cold temperatures and demonized for it
need a similar workers movement in pakistan but our big bad wolf is the military corporation just look up okara military farms where military has occupied farming land and the local farmers have been fighting their own fight without any help from anyone and a country wide media blackout

even after giving a law on msp and abrogating 3 farm laws tikait will not stop the protest because if the protest stopped who will know that rakesh tikait exist
what i have to say is that the agricultural sector in india clearly needs reforms agriculture sector badly needs high end technologies digital tools entrepreneurs and farmer organisations to provide services to farmers but the framework to reform it should also provide adequate safeguards to the farming community and clear out their doubts and fears they should not be left to linger in concerns about the enactments necessary changes can also be made upon consultation and hearing their views because they are are the ones without any bad influence of dirty politicians
illeterates voted the current dispensation and nation is suffering

indian news anchors shout so much that i hardly watch it this is the voice
very cognitive video thanks sir for such intresting video
what this guy is talking about end of the story money can buy anything
keep crying fake farmer is
government must make msp a law to assure poor farmers
when he she goes to sell his her products at msp
modi is a fascist and hindu nationalist sikhs muslims and all minority under threat in modis new india
when modi brings something then you guys bent upon to paint him as dictator but when he corrects climbs down you guys do not want to say that he respects democratic values eventhough it was a bit late he do not want to give leverage to opposition and get united under sharad pawar he also need to break the khalistani leverage within farmer groups the farmer protest could have lingered even for years with their illegal money flown from anti national movement of course he needs consider overall propects of his political party as a prominent leader of it
opposition will try their 100 to do everything from violence to all to fit and use this to use in political agenda to get in powers as this type of incident fully help opposition to destabilize current power indian internal ruff and opposition party mindset for their personel benifit is very dangerous for the country this need to be short out fast either army needs to involve or raw need to take these matter in hand otherwise these internal things with disintegrate india in long run
does military will interfere in things like this
first of all they some punjab sikh outside india are using other to show khalsa second they have negativity over hindu they say raj kare ga khalsa and dont want to speak hindi in family in punjab n outside india third thats why they dont like current government thats the whole story to protest we see them brother but some of them want khalsa you will get to know one day brother
let is take example zeba shamim formal education and khushbu informal education
specially sikh farmers
the taliban have kicked the wests a for the last 20 years and now are taking over the whole of afghanistan defeating the resistance
the problem is that in most cases msp is the highest price farmers can get bihar does not have apmc act see the condition of bihar is farmer working as a labor in another state maharashtra does not have farmer suicide in maharashtra is common in india leaders only think about consumers not about farmers when production increases cost of the potato onion etc becomes very low govt will not interfere when the opposite happens govt will stop export reduce import duty to check the cost in both cases farmers are the only sufferer why these farm laws do not fix the minimum support price they want to allow private entities why they are not saying that private entities will not be able to buy the product below the minimum support price why they are allowing private entities to stock the farming product they want that agriculture has to follow the market rules fine why do they stop export and reduce import duty when the cost of rice potato es etc starts to rise that is also a market rule govt will control the market when they feel that consumers will suffer however they do not care about farmers if govt wants to control and regularize the market they have to give farmers minimum support price
this are not farmers if they are throwing stone bracketing and fighting with police and in punjab cm said that he is not going to follow central govt bill then why this drama by congress party
what is going on here full crowd please help their
my appeal to the agitators is that create some concrete movement and not just sitting some where for months together

he knows this is not a farmers protest yet he says it is kosher in a democracy too many woke and confused people in journalism
one factual error farmers are not allowed to sell their produce outside their state where the fact remains that traders or the middlemen cannot sell it outside their own state but your video was easy to understand and not biased

some argue that there is no tax on farm income in india this argument does not stand a closer and fact based scrutiny the minimum limit of taxable income in india is about rs 500 000 a huge majority of the farmers will never touch this limit even if they were to earn at their full msp so where is the benefit of this exemption and does that also exempt a farmer from the indirect taxes that he has to pay for every other item of farm input gst has to be paid on every tool service seeds diesel

why did pro reform farmers not come openly in support of 3 farm laws the agitation was predominantly by punjab farmers and to some extent by haryana farmers the western up farmers agitated for guaranteed msp not against the farm laws as mandi system and procurement is much lower than punjab and these farmers go to mandis in punjab to sell wheat

firstly i am against this msp system itself this socialist scheme looks nice to hear but we need to understand when and why it was bought it was before green revolution when we were importing wheat after green revolution things has changed this msp has forced farmers to grow only rice sugarcane wheat because state decides the price godowns are full of wheat and govt is unable to sell the goods

you idiots supporting them do not realize or are maybe blind to the fact that there was a pre agreed timeline when they were supposed to take out the tractor rallies but by braking police barriers ahead of time at two border checkpoints they have endangered everyone around them creating chaos and anarchy is not equal to protest and most definitely not peaceful by any means
this is the fall of kabul and the us is the biggest stakeholder in it the rest of the democratic world is nothing more than a deaf and dumb clown only

it may not be modiji is defeat but it definitely is the defeat of all those who trusted him and voted for him do we mean nothing to him is political expediency all that matters did we or did we not vote for his more than 300 mps because we expected them to know what they are doing then either they should not be passing laws that they do not think are worthwhile or they should not go back on them because a couple of lacs farmers stop all traffic for a whole year then why did the delhi population suffer for so long are large roads only meant to be places where the opposition stops traffic and holds the entire public there to ransom is this what modi is telling them this is nonsense if allowing himself to be blackmailed into backing out of perfectly good laws shows his 56 inch chest then i d much rather it is not advertised he has proved himself to be another vajpayee vajpayee gave in to the terrorists and modi gives in to farmers from canada very disappointing

i watched patiently 5 00 min for him to explain the reasons and still he has not explained it lets get this straight punjabi haryanvi farmers are the biggest beneficiaries of msp its a previlige and maybe due to policital reasons how come we dont see other farmers from different up in arms secondly the ecommonic commodities act is anachronistic law from 1960s and 1970s it does not allow anyone to stock on certain essential items removing this law will allow entites like wholesale dealers to stock up and help in price fluctuations like in onions and potatoes there is nothing wrong with this from an economic efficiency point of view as rumi said this too shall pass

i had an opinion on mr modi as a leader who had guts this handling of protests just shows he s just weak like other is mayawati jeyalalitha and even mamta banerjee would have handled this better farmers cannot keep on vandalising everything and govt should have guts to use force bjp has failed and will appease any1 for votes
he is a man of guts
if this protest was to defend farmers then why is that only the wealthiest farmers are fighting against this its like amazon saying socialism or communism is bad for the country the highest farmer suicide rate is in maharashtra and bihar not punjab whole india supports this bill except for punjab we all know what greta thunberg tweeted along with the toolkit explaining exactly what rihanna has to tweet and at what time this is all an atmept to break and systematically dismantle the worlds largest democracy to create khalistan do not let foreigners divide india again lots of farmers throws or sell at very low prices as they don t get buyers as there is limit on hoarding

please realize yourself
modi cannot be trusted at all
do u know only punjab farmers were opposing it why bcoz they were most benefitting from it
just blame pakistan for that too as usual
these laws with a few changes made in the interest of farmers as is their demand can be revolutionary and can bring an end to these protests but currently they are more deadly than anything in a long run both for consumers and farmers
from lakhimpur deeply condemn this incident
including amit shah and modi will also included in this famine
it was just a simple and clear explaination of farm bills from the introducing to the repealing it was just an amazing explaintion i loved it thank you so much for such an explaination

1 more than 70 of wheat and paddy produce in punjab haryana is procured under msp and they are saying 6 on all india basis which is wrong as other farmers are not having marketable surplus 10 crore out of 14 6 crore farmers have land holding less than 1 ha and major area is under rained 2 punjab haryana rajasthan are the only state which engage ardthiyas commission agent in procurement and in other states like mp which contributes equal to punjab in central pool procures through primary agril credit societys gram sahkari sewa samiti ardthiyas have earned more than rs 800 crore in wheat procurent only in punjab haryana why procurement is happening through mandies as pacs are capable which is farmers body skm is not demanding this as procurement centre will near to farmer and scheduling of arrival can be monitored pacs will make profit and more services like storage grading processing etc can be set up at pacs level it is happening in other states like mp chhatisgarh odisha telangana and up has also started 3 msp to be made as base price for auction in mandies so govt need not to procure and farmers are free to sell outside the mandies as per new act skm is not demanding that msp to be made as base price for auction skm is just saying msp guarantee which is creating confusion so demand should be specific 4 skm leaders are creating confusion that how a small farmer will sell the produce of 1 or 2 qtl in bangalore or chennai in this connection central govt has a target of 10000 farmers producers organisation fpos means one fpo block which will aggregate farm produce and will negotiate with traders these fpos will be managed by farmers themselves by hiring professionals and central govt is giving more than 25 lakh fpo as a grant fpo is the most efficient marketing channel and local rural youth can be motivated and guided properly ardthiyas commission agent should not be member of fpos visit sfac nabard ncdc website in addition to fpos rural youth can form their rural cooperatives 15 20 rural youth or may be rural youth of entire village of marketing which may set up private market yards or e trading centre these rural cooperatives will get their service charge or can set up their processing unit and can have tie up with retailers like reliance dress big bazar or can open their marketing outlet in nearby city moong will be produced by farmers and will be procured by local rural cooperative which can set up their pulse unit also and govt schemes are available 5 75 of 305 million tonne foodgrains cereals pulses as oilseeds is not a part of foodgrains consists of wheat and paddy 235 million tonnes which means coarse cereals like bajra maize zowar ragi mundua etc and pulses have production of only 70 mt of which small proportion of farmers have marketable surplus but we import the pulses so farmers of punjab haryana and western up should go for diversification of crops as water table and soil fertility is also an issue in these areas 6 some commodities like bajra maize jowar mandua ragi should be included in pds by respective state govt so that procurement from farmers will happen at local level karanataka govt has included ragi in pds system skm is not having this demand bcoz it will affect the procurement of wheat paddy in punjab haryana as maximum kisan morcha leaders are from these states 7 43 large farmers 10ha and 22 medium farmers 4 ha of the country are from western rajasthan and we can easily understand their level of production skm is not aware about the definition of farmers so we can understand their level of awareness about farmers problems they are just befooling the entire country 8 more than 7 crore farmers have land holding less than 0 5 ha and pm samman nidhi of rs 6000 is a big help to them govt is giving samman to all farmers otherwise it could have saved more than 30000 cr
bhai solutions    vedio  l      finally this problem is ours and for our future generations how can we resolve it
we did this during the caa protest and even now for the farm 2020 bill but the government does not care
mic todne se bill wapas nai aayega sanjay ji ye baat samajhiye jo aapne kia wo bhi galat hee tha aur unneccessary tha kyunki wo tamasha karna ka koi fayeda nai hua ulta aap suspend ho gaye protesting and challenging this bill in court would be the right way i think rather than inciting drama and violence in rajya sabha

government is doing this at the behest of economists in imf and world bank for last two decades they have been suggesting that there are two many people working in the indian farms farming being a low value income source globally is not profitable until it is done at a large scale with the new laws the indian government wants to eventually end msp as it believes that msp is not sustainable for the indian economy the idea here is that eventually only large farmers will survive and the agriculture sector will get mechanized like us and china the small farmers will have no way but to sell their lands and work as low wage workers in services and manufacturing sectors providing ample manpower for the corporations it is s catch 22 situation for the indian government as it knows that it is impossible to improve the living standard of the low holding farmers with msp while the farmer is concern that they will have no option but to sell off their lands and move to other sectors for wages is also correct

this is like bending yielding to the anarchic behaviour of vested interests

harshita pathak forward caste bjp
but these laws were already introduced in abroad and proved to be disastrous these laws also states that no tax needed to be paid for private sector clearly indicates that it should increase privatisation if privatisation is introduced farmers are prone to be fooled by corporate companies whose agenda is only profits as we know the literacy rate of farmers is comparatively low they will not be able to understand the company policy and conditions before signing any agreement in order to protect our farmers i think government should be involved and help farmers through the process

india is agriculture has 50 employment after the agricultural reform agricultural companies do not need so many workers the agricultural policy of the communist party of india marxism is more successful than cpc but cpc has more achievements in industry so many farmers enter the industrial system after leaving their fields but cpc had many tragic stories because of the employment problem from 1980 to 2000 china was like a mini yeltsin is russia
these judges clearly lack the logic we typically assume a legal expert would have

all these famers are a drag on miniscule income tax paying community in india they get free electricity no income tax on agriculture income and then loan waivers all that comes from our pockets plus they get reservations and sops during elections and then these very farmers choose the worst kind of illiterate politicians in elections let them suffer and commit suicide they deserve this fate
in india physically handicapped pay income tax but rich and super rich farmers do not

let s pray for those children who don t have their parents they are real legend 
i come from india where supposedly educated people celebrate repeal of laws that would have liberalized farming economy enabled farmers to sell anywhere reduced food prices
more than half of the states in country dont have apmcs or have already passed bill to sell outside of apmcs anyways
the government should respect the demands of the farmers we do not know what is wrong with them we do not like the government decision on this issue
now all farmers will become rich millionaires
8 see pakistani fake news propaganda that indian govt is against sikhs not one opposition politician or farmer leader refuted this
there is probably a phonebook just with the names singh in india
unless they destroy agriculture sector by making it an extremely non viable occupation they will not be able to force the farmers to sell their lands at cheap prices to i agents of plutocrats or and ii government on one side they are planning to acquire large parcels of land from small land holders and on the other hand it over smoothly to plutocrats this is what modi and co has been doing in gujarat for so many years they are trying out the same in other parts of india as well
h each farmer will have it is agrivalue based on quantity of land utilised and can be availed any time with help of banking system integrated with apex body and it is farming community
election coming one and half year in punjab
i hate modi i hate bjp i hate this current government

godi media is too late fir is out blaming minister is son
selective definition of a peaceful rally
j basic policies should not be changed but additional options may be introduced for safety of farmers and the organisation
even anchor cannot explain the bill
i feel these laws will be back this looks to be a tactical withdrawal i support the farm laws and was disappointed when they were withdrawn however i m very very heartened that modi took back the laws even at the cost of his reputation that tells me that he is not drinking his own ego you need to really be concerned about a leader who is inflexible because of his image and ego that to me further strengthens my belief in bjp and modi
washing powder nirmala
being a farmer from maharashtra we want revaluation of farm policy we accept farm bill

how difficult it is to do reforms in india
these are not farmers dacoits
the bills were introduced by the same govt and after the long protests by farmers they were forced to return it how much did you guys get paid by them godi media
8 tikait has been boycotted by actual farmers he is no more hero like his father
burn baby burn

beggars bluddy farmers even my dog will not pie on you
now days judiciary become a joke
overall a bad move as india needed these agriculture reforms and its gonna motivate other protesters cum mob rioters who in the name of peaceful protest deteriorates law and order and damage public property
india the union is on a self destruct path under bjp rss future looks bleak
those who didnt watch the whole 8 26 hour video
you are absolutely correct and he must pay compensation for the deaths of so many farmers from his own assets and the pm is fund since he is the prime instigator of these laws
savings account no 39570166343

hence there will be no affect on exchequer
its elections time in up faking farmers protest in full swing
  media is always supporting bjp neta because this is bikau and dalal media
article 19 3 nothing in sub clause b of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevent the state from making any law imposing in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of india or public order reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said clause
and plz report the truth
well explained very useful video
shame on the police who is work is to stop crime is stopping farmers and then calling it law
i support farmer is protests i also supported caa protests they all work as star pracharak events for modi and bjp because these protests create a strong feelings of nationalism among common people which normally remain dormant of india and make bjp stronger these protests also work as filter that clearly separate out who is for the country and who is against it
why are you foolish to allow them to attack you
have some shame you coward arnab
our news media sold its soul to defend the government no wonder shit like this happens
republic tv get your sound adjustments right cannot understand anything

the arguments send like the sentiments we had before deregulation of our economy if we do not have storage facilities for 6 percent of the produce how does one buy 100 percent of it where does one store it cannot sell it because it is way above market price agree with diversification of msp
you people defamed the superior ego of racists
btw if bjp would have been in opposition they atleast do not not go to fake left rallies which illegally occupies roads and they do not seek support of foreigners to malign indian image they protest in parliament
how can they do it strange unhuman
one of the worst day is when terrorists change afghan to taliban country and also attack other countries
up me covid hoti hai to supreme court jag jati hai lekin kerala me covid hota hai to supreme court soo jati hai west bengal me hinsha hoti hai jahn 10 se bhi jyda logo ko maar diya jata hai or mahila ke sath balatkar howa lekin supreme court soo rhi thi lekin up me 4 kishan mar jate hai to supreme court jaag jati hai wahhhh re supreme court kya nayya krti hai
nobody need warn india it is not necessary for india poke it is nose in the present situation of afghanistan either unless and until india is affected by others ideologies before warning one has to see that all under the umbrella are happy

congratulations to farmers solidarity against modi and bjp next freedom for kashmir and khalistan

well idk if you know this but the protestors have been protesting peacefully in delhi for 2 months 2 months before that in punjab if they wanted to be violent they would not have waited this long also when they arrived at delhi they were charged with batons expired tear gases without any reason they were just going to delhi regardless of being beaten they fed meals to those policemen here are 2 links kindly see what is the reality behind all this you cannot judge a 2 month old protest just because violence brokeout on just 1 day this is video from vox it will explain why the protest is happening this is a day at the protest

this is not democracy it is no where near democracy the pm has a lot to answer for
you are wright sir
so sad for all india
very nice sir but it would have been a better analysis if you would have also given the benefits that the government will provide by introducing these bills as their intention behind it might be moving towards a capitalist economy and reducing govt involvement in major segments however what you provided was an analysis from the farmers point of view which was crystal clear
what should the protesters do when the government don give a shit about peaceful protests they were peaceful for last 4 months they cannot sit their for next 4 months if coz then who would do farming bachi kuchi gdp farming ke hi wjh se bachi h goverment is testing their patience making them resort to revolt and history is witness for independence freedom fighters had to resort to revolt
we are all indians support farmer 
i have been staunch supporter of farmers protests but this a very bad timing please go back do not be one more superspreaders
prod off
though modi does not have guts to communicate with them about the laws being made for farming he is a coward who can just rule people wht to do and everyone is keep following him shame on those people who are blind and dump like this channel
indians living all over the world want justice for farmers what breaks my heart is that pm modi has not once acknowledged the agitation of farmers how can the pm show such a indifference how can he ignore the agitation going on for months its just unbelievable and unfair the central government instead of trying to understand farmers has activated nia investigation on people who are providing resources to these farmer protesters such as feeding sanitation and other resources the government wants to deter these protestors by attacking their support

excellent video confirming my understanding one more glaring pattern of protests is how none of the so called communists protested the domination by uber ola or the domination by the middlemen cartel
they r sinking fleet
unfortunately again the opposition is misguiding farmers
this is a right wing funded channel these guys will never criticize wrongdoings of bjp

kudos to the farmers it took none other than a sardarjee to teach modi a lesson kejriwal priyanka shut up and get lost
listen farmers are super poor and they cannot survive if they do not work for a week and these protestors are not farmers they are traders who buy yields from farmers at cheapest price and sell them in the best price
never vote these people in future
superbly explained really u are great sir jai bheem
right decision
the only reason why farmers are protesting is msp and i stand with farmers

guys please know that the indian government did this exact same thing in 1984 sikhs were fighting the corrupt government then too they were fighting for india they were not asking for khalistan but the government maligned their movement like they tried to do with this one calling them terrorists and khalistanis and turned hindus against sikhs and since there was no social media at that time the public was successfully fooled by the government congress at the time bjp is the same as congress remember that in the next elections people vote for someone different than these two if you really want to see change if you really want to see a true democratic india with a government that is for its people and not looting its people in broad daylight please realize this before its too late before india is bought by goons

hail india
after the events of republic day there is little sympathy for these thugs who are a combination of middlemen rich farmers and crowds imported and paid for by vested interests your reporting in deeply flawed banal and superficial and for this reason highly misleading pm modi is the best pm we have had he has the courage to go against the tide as these path breaking laws are a 1991 moment for poor farmers and middle farmers farmers but they strike a body blow to middlemen this is what this protest is about because it hits against corruption in punjab and haryana i have not understood what these thugs want these laws are path breaking as they free both producers and consumers to sell in the open market if they want you can thugs bringing in thousands of tractors from these states poor stocked up for six months poor the government has been open to talks and has dealt with them with exceptional restraint rich farmers have been treated as holy cow in this country they rich segment benefit hugely from subsidies pay no taxes and buy cheap from the poor cultivator and sell at huge prices in the market this has to stop rich farmers need to pay taxes the agricultural sector has been at the bane of benami holdings by corrupt netas and babus pm modi is breaking this vicious strangehold for which he deserves praise and not condemnation by doing he would be the first pm who has actually helped those who need to be helped the fact that there is information aysmmetry here and tthat the government has not sold the reform as strongly as they should have adds to the confusion this is a bold reform and it must be welcomed precisely because it is being opposed by the rich and hijacked by an opposition that does not have a head or a tail the same applies to your covid reporting you fail to mention that we have handled the crisis despite our poor health infrastructure extremely well with the lowest death rate and the highest ecvery rate in the world in contrast to the uk france the us and russia and the rest of europe who have made a mess of it figures in these countries are staggering your reporters and correspondents need to delve beneath appearances to reach the reality hidden within you do injustice to the fair name of the bbc with this stereotyped reporting the country cannot be held to ransom by a gang of thugs spreading misinformation and deceit
so plz believe on true news
they are khalisthan supporters with their flags they are not true farmers
farmers are responsible and real and royal for democracy
very balanced program thanks for airing views of different experts and eminent people in toto without prejudice
govts only can file fir on people
the world will never get down the us will definitely respond to taliban in a harsh way there is no any place for terrorists on this planet terrorism is demons by this they created an image of devil on islamic religion i vow that taliban and all other terrorists organisations around the globe will be taken down us did not exonerate their soldiers due to any fear of taliban but it was to focus on who created covid 19 obviously covid 19 is a biological war by china terrorists are aliens no mercy no peace that is why they risk their entire lives in terror attacks they do not concern about their family and friends even allah will burn them in hell l as a non muslim i whole heartedly believe that even allah is worrying why they are using islam religion as a shield for their terrorism even though how they try to transform into gurreilla soldiers they considered terrorists
sir please make video on revivalists and reformists as this topic is very confusing
every protest democratically is acceptable but going away from constitution to be arsonists is wrong

reforms that would change life of millions becomes history
the country needs at least one more modi administration to build on the ongoing economic administrative reforms the benefits of which will become more visible in the post covid era
but i agree with the question of why no debate was allowed that is a fair question to ask the bjp government

i watched your entire video and found you could not stand neutral and justify the protests due to lack of understanding in subject do you know india is in top 5 agricultural producing countries still indian farmers earn way less than their western counterparts why so because current apmc act prohibits farmers to sell their produce out of mandi so called wholesale market in mandi a mediator would buy farmers produce on low cost and sell high to retailers farmers do not get the right price for their products hence

these farmers can never succeed because there is no iota of truth value in their struggle for regression into land lord feudal caste based class structure struggle against parallel competitive market actually a fraction of desert land is enough to produce food than so many of them inefficiently do they can use the high capital intensive techno agriculture which they cannot opt within the outdated regressive government supported expensive cultivation of unwanted crops using bloated employment patterns that flourishes only narcissist identity cults media uses it to fuel hatred for somebody like ambani adhani not at all related the media punjabi vs gujarati because modi is from gujarat even mahatma is statues are defaced they spin narratives phoophooing nationalism because modi represents national interest they push hatred for hindutva because modi is a hindu they even sell dislike of chai wallas as they dislike modi to what nasty distance narrative pushing can go

with new bill indian government will not be responsible for farmers products and all pushed into market however india is farming is very low efficiency india has 25 more arable land than china but the total yield is only less than 1 2 of china is the low efficiency means high cost india is grain has not much profit space to compete in world market ambanis can simply import from world market and sell to india and at the same time they can use it to set the price for the grain or other agriculture products to form monopoly too india farmers and ordinary people will suffer only ambanis got huge benefit

the propagandists are goading people into joining the protests in the name of sikhism guru govind singh those who oppose them are branded as enemies of the community are threatened with banishment from the society and this is all happening under the pretext of farmers protests  sharma said
what a hypocrisy false drama irresponsible and disgraceful conduct for the sake of power by mva government in maharashtra come elections and these pseudo secular worthies like akhilesh yadav raga priyanka are on a temple hopping spree to garner hindu votes priyanka does not want to go to hanumangadh in rajasthan congress ruled state where a dalit was brutally lynched to death they gandhi family have conveniently forgotten 1984 planned sikhs massacre where thousands of sikhs were butchered in broad daylight opposition should not play politics over dead bodies in lakhimpur ultimately law will take it is own course

the end of rakesh tikait career by n d modi
only 6 percent of the farmers avail of the procurement facility of the govt under msp and most of the other farmers trade with local small scale traders with their price fluctuating hence making msp mandatory will send those small scale traders to jail that fear in those traders will adversely effect farmers since they wont find much buyers so legalising msp is redundant and is also disadvantageous to the farmers

with left and mslm lobby getting stronger due to wokism etc in west modi is a liability for hindu causes in the back of his mind he is on the defensive because of gujarat riots history particularly because he cares too much about international image

2 if any dispute between farmers and corporate people court doors are shut for farmers they cant go to any court they can only go to sdm or maximum to dc now you tell me is a sdm or dc in range of a small farmers in india
the people who are protesting are not farmers they are brokers
your voice is a medical therapy for me only towards my this big journey
watched this after repealing of the farm laws laughing my ass off
great pm but chutiya public in india
to be frank farm laws seemed very bureaucratic and poorly thought out without thinking of second and third order of things without any due diligence to availability of supporting infrastructure given to atleast small and marginal farmers they did zero study on agricultural knowledge intellect of the farmers and making no arrangement to improve it either
i ai not support any group party but i am happy to see that our farmers are happy
now at least hang these guys who has killed our farmers
so in conclusion this protest had nothing to do with farm bills but something that punjab wants for past several years and that is their own rules and own country punjab either needs to learn to reform or india needs to find other channels govt should not be forced to pay for poor quality product just because of set minimum if companies ran the show they wouldve had to do things correctly and thats what these farmers all fear inability to cut corners
she is all over the place month or 2 before elections
to have a comparison about scale the avarage size of wheat farm in the wheat belt of western australia 4 thousand acres whereas 85 of indian farmers are less than 2acres

farm bill perfectly enacted the orders of their corporates boss even we had a big issues with external aggression anti people government continues their sabotaging
industry is allowed scale it is given finances and even then it is provided protection from international competition in the form of anti dumping duty
right
what happened on 26th is right no punishment for that no one is accountable what is happening
it means these elections in every five years have much more used to people the power to vote and elect your favorite govt is a serious duty to every countrymen
youth are the only hope in these dark times

good morning sir an
how you fly a helicopter without any blades
the bjp in india has a problem that can only be solved by spreading hypocritical nationalism and racism in pakistan and china the indian public consciousness has changed so much
both party are chutiya parties
it is a fake farmer protest now it a time to take strict action against them
only income increased in your presentation in reality income is decreases
great go ahead farmers neither they will get tired or give up until three bills are taken back by the ego central government whole nation is with farmers those against these farmers dont deserve to eat anything
why does it feel as if they themselves want to die were not they are the ones committing suicides because of the exploitation committed by middle men
the one dead farmer killed himself by driving the tractor at high speed into a barricade and the tractor toppling on top of him what your headline seemed to miss was the numbers of indian police men and women who died as a result of the protestors actions the protesters were protesting against the addition of an option to sell their crops by themselves without middlemen eating into their profits this riot was backed by non else than greta thunberg who was involved in producing and releasing a google toolkit outlining the incidents on these dates inciting these people to do what they did environmental greta backed those who destroy indias environment by stubble burning use pesticides prolifically making that area the cancer capital of india and whose indiscriminate use of fertiliser has polluted the water table well done greta
deeply grateful
such discrepancy must be stopped immediately
this is not the land for gujaraties this is the land of indians christians muslims and the people who were kicked out from mohenjadaro harappa and dwraka
fantastic news indeed and jaihind really appreciated
this bill is not good for farmer it is only beneficial for middle man big farmers not for small farmers those who are in the favour of this law my request to them to please watch search the information of the bill then you will understand it is benefit for farmer or not we support farmers
congress and other party knows rule very well what she converted wants to meet their families at this crucial time when government wants to control that area is supporting your government makes you stupid at this time also then i would like to vote bjp once again
why you not show that what about not arresting but help goons attack

now time for india awake and get out from kashmir immidiately because usa and russia finally understand reality better for rest of india
minimum price or msp can be declared on major important crops in all states of india by state central governments even if they do not procure or buy the agricultural produce from farmers plus no one should be allowed to purchase from the farmers below the minimum price msp it should be made illegal to purchase from farmers below msp whether inside or outside mandi it will improve the condition of farmers plus farmers should accept this as a deal and end their protest in my opinion
all because we have such kind of cm who is busy in changing the name of cities
india is much better country under bjp is govt
the ruling party from the world biggest democracy used heavy vehicles to knock down and rollover countless farmers and not single a word was utter free western society

election results me dikhega farmer power
so the farmers were absolutely right the question is if the govt really cared about the farmers what was so difficult in making the msp mandatory bcz the farm laws did have some good features but for just this one loophole the govt let it all go and repealed the laws
this is height of modi bhakti

surely good journalism requires you to point out what is likely to happen after deregulation in the us the 1996 farm bill was introduced with promises of farmers being able to sell abroad and thereby increase commodity demand however in 1998 42 000 us farmers with less a turnover of less than 250 000 dollars disappeared because prices fell in 1998 small family farms disappeared and large corporations with deeper pockets thrived by streamlining distribution and driving prices down this is great new for the consumer i hear you shout yes maybe in the first instance but later when these corporations whose primary aim is profit start buying farms which they no doubt will do india will go the way of the us ie prices and supply being dictated by corporations who create virtual monopolies and offshore tax structures that benefit their shareholders and deprive indians of proper tax revenues and choices yes the current system requires changing but do not be fooled by promises of exports and globalisation global markets are very often more volatile that local markets surely a better way is to find a middle ground deregulate the outdated systems but at the same time enshrine in law some method of protecting its own people from corporate greed source exported to death economic policy institute 1999

incorrect assumption that private players will pay more than the mandi price the only way to solve this problem is to increase farm yields per acre thereby reducing cost of production so that cost of production per kg quintal is lower than the free market rate our agriculture universities have completely failed the farmers and our country to help improve farm productivity levels without solving for this farming in our country is a loss making and not sustainable and the farmers will continue to need financial support

if farmers sit in the middle of the road they will get crushed

step of revoking farmers law by prime minister shri narendra modi is totally unacceptable it will definitely badly impact up punjab vidhan sabha elections as well as lok sabha elections i am badly hurt with this avoidable revocation 99 of farmers are impacted due to this inaccurate decision
i am support always farmer

can someone explain if as he said 94 farmers are not using apmc to sell their produce so i believe they are still being exploited regarding pricing as they do not get msp so why are farmers protesting if most of them do not use the present services it seems that he did not cover the entire situation and there is much more to it that what he is describing here

charcha nahi hai sir ji yahan 20 lac people are sitting on the border of delhi
shame on congress for introducing this bill earlier in parliament
this political trouble seems to have started once bill gates got involved it sounds like they are forcing deregulation so that foreign entities can come in and take control of the farms while leaving the farmers hanging out to dry either way bill gates is right that indian farms produce 20 per acre what american farmers do if huge farm start becoming five times more efficient that will crater prices big time the farmers that have fed all of india for hundreds of years need to have a soft landing and provisions made for their children that way the people benefit from low prices and the farmers are taken care of but it sounds like greedy government officials are just trying to throw these poor farmers out on the streets because they are too greedy or lazy to work them into the solution
rich middlemen took over the protest and there is no one but media to blame they knew exactly what the truth was but decided to make money from trp in name of farmers
now politicians do not care about people is problems they just divert issues
bjp has lost all sensitivity they are just power hungry how shamelessly they are laughing at the deaths of farmers now it should not be forgotton when election comes they only know election and should be taught a lesson by handing him a humiliating defeat and when he comes to your house for vote he should be chased away
shame on supporter of opposites

nobody should support this protest it is run by khalistani extremists the agenda is not even farmers it is fuelled by protests due to punjabi sikh desire to separate the state 1 no other famers in the nation have protested although they have been coerced by khalistani interests 2 khalistani goons and rich farmers do not want price controls on the poor who they extort 3 khalistani interests have funded the entire movement 4 farmers themselves have not cooperated in mediations in governmental talks 5 the resources and tools used by the farmers to aid in protest were extremist in nature and call for separation of state what is amazing is the amount of people who back the movement using riot politics because they 1 hate modi for inexplicable reasons they blame him for gujrat riots at the exclusion of his court appointed innocence and also despite khalistanis being responsible for the massacre of hindus prior to those same riots 2 they saw shaheen bhag and they are taking it as an opportunity to black label the government and pretend hindus and modi are evil and 3 they are attempting to appeal to those who believe sikhs are innocent faultless and pure despite the fact that sikhs have lost their honourable reputation decades ago and the sikhs of today pander towards pakistan isi and vested extremist khalistani interests no friend nobody should support this protest at all support your country and your government

first read plz 1 farmers can not decide price in apmc but they can bargain with different private companies for price 2 msp govt has cleared that msp will continue more clearer picture bout it in future 3 contract farming they can contract with companies which assures fixed price paid to farmer after harvest if he gets low price from them he can sell in mandis hence monopoly is not a problem if this is implemented properly 4 if prices of perishable guds increases by 100 and that of non perishable by 50 govt will add them in essential commodities and these guds will be regulated again to keep a check on black market acc to me if my opinion counts from last 20 yrs farmers and farmer unions were asking for reforms in agri and controlling middlemens policies towards farmers so we shud appreciate this step yes all hav ryt to protest but all of us shud first see impact of this bill in future remember previous bills or acts were not so good to help farmers they were mainly helping middlemen and farmers were doin suicides so if some govt has tried to bring reforms lets try to appreciate and see how this is implemented if there is any problem farmers will go to court in near future

3 framework for contract farming first contract farming is totally voluntary it usually takes place between buyer and seller farmer s for specialized commodities for meeting niche markets such as baby corn special varieties of capsicum etc formal contract farming has enabled farmers to offer produce at predetermined price and for market price above contractual price farmer has liberty to sell at higher price small farmers have benefitted more than large farmers in contract farming as income derived per acre was the highest for small farmers experience of baby corn and vegetables
yes they need entertainment not just food
i do not support these farmer laws it will totally help the elites to takeover land of the farmers and there is a clause that if any dispute happens between the company and farmer then the case will be gone the court and if you are not aware of this but judges can be corrupt for this there would be stay order or the company may bribe the judges to give the favourable judgement for the company owner and the farmer may loose his land

its very sus to see only punjabi in this protest as they are the wealthiest farmers and mandi lords in india
there are majorly 2 ends of this problem at production end farmer and at marketing end at farmer end problem of seed selection or credit availability or using ict for connecting with experts is there and it is explained quite well in this further from marketing end this video will help take some initiatives in my opinion small landholding is also one of major cause of farmers as it restricts economics of scale may we some co operatives like in lines of dairy cooperatives can be formed in future
this is so stupid those reforms were absolute necessary for development

you sir are learned and know very well the irrigation demand of rice and wheat if you artificially keep the prices of these commodities high the repercussions will be felt in the coming years high prices of these commodities will act as a deterrent for the farmers to rotate the crop cycle and you very well know sir how thirsty paddy and wheat crops are it not only endangers our economy but also the ecosystem

your beloved fan nl tean
this is really disturbing why no one is there to help them
i was impressed by the facts shown by u in west bengal one of your videos but after looking more and more videos i feel that u r planted by feku govt to dilute public anger towards feku govt bcoz now u r defending feku taklu as a political tool launched by feku party u forget to tell us that mid feb to april 2020 when maharashtra and delhi hv rising covid cases why feku had invited trump in namastey trump in ahmedabad resulted in deadly fast blast covid coupled with deaths in gujarat thereafter and then facts of deaths were hiden by the feku govt for whole india which suited the non feku govts too but then delhi was the only state provided facts figures correctly then said by the court too later on so when feku was the only person gaining credit for everything good he must be the solely responsible person to be blamed it is obvious and moreover all the arrangements handled by feku is central govt in regards to medicines vaccines oxygen financial helps etc as we see for example feku states got more financial help than needed asked for and nonfeku govt did not got even sufficient requirements asked for the worst of it is delhi fully under feku is lg worst affected amongst all which did not given any single penny financial help and delayed medicines oxygen and vaccines required quota resulted in unnecessary death tolls and lastly why election rallies held kumbh mela permitted to people sadhus must be scatteredly permitted on ghats but elections r most important for feku taklu than deaths in india that is why shabwahini ganga we hv seen so pl u too go to hell
now we have to proud to be an indian

his body language says it all he is lying rip democracy
compare modi with other family run political parties honestly
why contract farming what way it is related to globalization
let the scavengers here starve
do whatever u can farm bill will still be implemented
please cover the rabiya saifi news
another argument is that contract farming will benefit the farmers because they will get an assured price pre written in the contract they say that this will give them a better price at least better than their input costs our economists tend to convey a sense that the farmers will be able to dictate their terms and prices if that is really so then why does not the government jump in and write an msp
fro
we are border districts ok karanrata due to mandi system we cant sell our group to another state where the price is much higher
people power is bigger than police
democracy in india what a joke
biased towards others
pm silent he will give promotion to the ias officer and the police that is his strategy
sansad main churcha hui manthan hua what a lie
another thing most of the small farmers were already being exploited by the bigger farmers since these bigger farmers were buying crops at a price lower than the msp the point of this law was to provide a path for the smaller farmers to sell their crop directly to the wholesalers which would guarantee them a better price than if they had sold it to these bigger farmers it is about giving the smaller farmers more agency over the price that they receive for their crops this is a two way argument you cannot talk about one side and ignore the other

700 farmers died nd they said nothing about it so sad
they are not happy with anything
we all welcome the announcement of the prime minister to repeal the farm laws unfortunate is the loss of hundreds of lives this backing of is primarily because of the election scheduled in punjab and uttar pradesh one thing is escaping our notice one the rural distress second is price rise third is job loss now all this is in the public domain and it is being spoken of this is also a ploy to dominate the narrative a big announcement will be spoken of and will be debated so the issues listed above will not get the attention as of seriousness when this announcement was being made he made a distinction in saying most of the farmers in the country where in support of the farm laws so a change of heart he did not even say a word on the hundred of deaths it is a political decision but let is say it is good

in a democracy a minister who is holding home minister portfolio and his son arrested for a murder of four farmers by plowing his car on them has no right to be a union minister but you cannot expect morality from a pm who killed thousands of muslims when he was cm of gujarat and an union home minister who assisted modi ji in executing the muslims in gujarat

what is your agenda
no matter what truth always win
the main problem lies with price hike which hardly taken into debate the price hike would effect directly bjp s hope much more than farm agitation which has added fuel to the fire fire has already errupted with price hike modi has to forgo his arrogance displeasing his two best beneficiaries the causality of 670 lives and unlimited pains on the part of agitated farmers would never heel inspite of belated feelings

when farmers have freedom to sell at price they want and at any place they want to sell why farmers are still protesting
peaceful protest by fake farmers
it is so sad to see government doing this to its own people
just last month pakistan hosted an oic meet to recognize taliban as a government
pm modi has done a great job to liberalize indian agriculture and paved the way to introduce industrial capital in agricultural products which in turn help boost the rural economy it will help extend the market on which modern indian independent capitalism will grow it will give india a great purchase power like china every country will come to india to sell their goods it will extend india is tax giving people more than 100 crores when 80 indian peasants start buying things for their choice and requirements industry will grow hundred and hundred folds unemployment problem will solve a great great thumps up for the very job by bjp and pm modi jee it has hurt the interest of 5 i is and canada is one of them they are the white colonial and extracted the labor of black people from africa they enslaved and tortured the black african and made money like uk usa australia new zealand they along with their follower who want to extract the blood of poor peasant of our country red salute to bjp who did the great job which left could not achieve for their majority left of india should support the bill with some constructive suggestions and rectifications

angad leading india and blessings
election and chair is the main reason
sadday for india is economic progress no govt will dare to touch land reforms or agri reforms both these are the biggest impediment to investment and the biggest source of corruption and black money in the country we briefly had hope that india was going todramtically change and join the more advanced nations club but that willl nowhav eto wait fr another decade or so anarchists have won and proved that an empowered majority govt can also not change the fortunes of india we will muddle along making compromises and protecting private interests and ruling parties will only prioritize electoral arithmetic over reform

a major point that youve missed out in your video is the fact that bihar has already abolished apmc mandis bihar farmers have suffered so badly that theyve had to move to punjab and haryana as labours on farms private players in bihar buy 1 kg of cabbage for rs1 so clearly these laws have been applied and is not beneficial for the farmers so i guess they arent protesting for the heck of it also the same model has been applied in america and france please do read about how the free market has ruined the lives of farmers clearly your research is not in place and your points are baseless
first of all they are not even real farmers and 99 of them did not even know the real farm law iust causing ruckus for the city and even if they want to protest despite knowing the real farm laws there are other ways to do it without disturbing other people
very soon we will capture all hindustan

the farmers protesting the farm bill are not only sikhs in punjab and haryana there are hindu farmers sikh farmers muslim farmers in punjab and haryana the farmers are not only from from jatt caste or sikhs there are also pundits brahmins and dogar farmers in punjab farmers feed the nation big companies like tata birla reliance ebany adnany these big companies are controlling modi these bills are designed to make each farmer compete against each other so that big companies can buy crops at lowest rate because farmer will have no option to sell to another buyer due to lack of logistics and lack resources and the big companies have the logistics and they will buy at lowest cost from farmers and export to other countries this will cause food shortage in india because big companies will able to export the crops to more profitable buyers in other countries and the food prices will get more expensive in india modi is working for the business tycoons and big companies the gst is hurting the small shops small factories modi needs to be removed from his throne

if any person kill one
the worst pm ever
here government want to make a law for farmer which was rejected by the farmer
both extreme solutions will be damaging to people the current system is unsustainable as small farmers produce very little and thus cannot compete on an open market without government subsidies even with the subsidies the farmers earn very little which does not allow them to invest in modernization the liberalization of the farming industry will force many farmers out of business as big players will outperform and outcompete small farmers that will be forced to sell their land and figure out by themselves what they should do now the latter solution wa not to quickly change the faming market no matter the human cost margaret tatcher style this will have quick beneficial results for the country but many farmers will be left to fend for themselves furthermore there is a risk that uncontrolled land acquisition fulled by corruption will create a handful of huge corporations that control and dominate the market destroying even large independent farmers
even government has not passed it yet it is on hold when it passes so it is act may god bless everyone who is at borders of delhi

pahele to government ko ye check karna chahiye ki wahan exactly kitne real farmers hai
excellent video but highly biased view you spoke about 3 phases of corporates that are beneficial to customers and farmers if you look at a corporate perspective they were incurring huge losses in the 4th phase also if they were getting into losses how will even corporates sustain the scenario will be still be like instead of farmers committing suicide it shall be the corporates committing now somewhere striking a balance can happen only once the schemes are rolled out successfully a lot of reality checks happen only on acutualization of the bill you can t have a clean plan on paper before you roll out such new initiatives
do not judge trust the politician by sweet words after winning the election they will bring back again the same bill against the farmers

action should be taken against that bluddy officer
farmers are innocent hard workers hope government tries to educate them about the empowerment and benefits of the bill passed its only because of state government politics and misguidance which has lead to chaos not at all farmer is fault nor the central government is fault if farmers are worried then government has to convince them and make sure corporate companies treat farmers equally as a business partner and do not exploit them once mandi system is removed only then farmers will be able to think out of the box hope we see farmers evolve and be the richest and happiest citizens

shoddy quality politicians shoddy quality teachers are the biggest reason that the country is a third world hell hole india can become the first world with just minimal effort if the government can leash itself and unleash the citizens of india government must bring electoral funding laws everyone in india knows the cause  that candidates must necessarily spend vast amounts of money whether white or black in contesting elections that then creates the incentive for corruption everyone who comes to power is guaranteed to become corrupt
he is trying to push his opinions and force this idea that they opposed the laws cos sikh is do not like modi such sheer stupidity bjp is in power in haryana and jaats supported modi whole heartily they opposed the laws because the were bad and the same people that voted for modi felt back stabbed

you would not know that these perpetrators in large numbers were denied visas during the last one month and now they cannot come to india any longer after the cancellation of their oci this is a major victory for the goi and in the coming days only its effect will be felt because these are the persons holding huge acres of land in india in benami names mostly in punjab haryana when they cannot come back to india their land holding will eventually be taken over by their benamis in india because these perpetrators cannot come back to india who are mostly in canada u s uk nz and australia
instead of pointing out any flaw in any of the clauses in the bill they are simply protesting it is time we differentiate between andolanjeevis and andolankaris

where is ravi sir
mr banerjee doesnt seems to know much about this subject but has a point of view about where he wants to go it is quite surprising for a nobel laureate to not be able to articulate in substantive way indian farmers needs a support system where long term storage of grains becomes a reality like in west that way they can save their crops for the time when there is good price to sell this is how government can help build for long term solution
concerned section of society should be given opportunities to express its point of view before taking the long time affecting legislation

2 why not this government is ready to give the same msp incentaviaztion like in 1960 on all other oil seeds other crops also i will say that government should think for giving msp of these oil seeds crops even more than present price of rice and wheat msps and then in 2 year only we will not be importing from malaysia and side by side our wheat and rice buffer stock will also go down because then mostly will switch to oil seed farming wrt to rice and wheat farming and in this way both problem will get solved india money will be in india because we will not be importing from malaysia and all crops msps will be guaranteed program from government to farmer to produce fearlessly

the truth is that india is still colony of uk monarchy who had forced repressive parliamentarian political to subdue people india is still a dominion under commonwealth nations of british monarchy under british law the evm main switch is in the hand of european neo colonial powers and it is tuned on and off in favor of populist puppet parliamentarian political parties and their leaders who follow the orders and implement them this switch which is turned on and off through imf world bank who un security council and nato so good luck with your dream to think india is an free country and a democracy
veyr very good decision by the ruling party of india this says a lot more about opposition than the ruling party coz including you why because you never tried to use journalism to spread correct information about the farmers law what it says and convey is that ruling the country is more important than serving the country opposition can go to any extent even destroying the common people and their interest if it serves them right you are also part of it remember that
these goonda who are disguised as farmers should be arrested and justice should be done these are khalistanis

lol half of these motherfuckers replying andbhakts and all that they literally think they are the most educated ones and know everything about the bill if you are taking a good decision the opposition will shout even louder as they do not want the positive outcome of that decision to outline the future of the current party the bills literally were in favor of poor farmers and it harmed the people who benefit from these farmers and half of these motherfuckers who call themselves indians are celebrating the withdrawal of the bill not even bjp would not hamper their position because of these idiots that is why they retracted the bill so fuck those farmers who protested against the bill fuck those idiots who cry for jobs india is the land of bright but more than that it is the land that garners some of the most useless and worthless peoples

yaswant sinha said the prime minister has stuck to his reputation of springing surprises the announcement of the decision to repeal the three farm laws came as a huge surprise last morning which apart from being the pious day of guru parab was also the birthday of indira gandhi the comparison with indira gandhi is apt because she also withdrew the emergency when she realised it had become untenable despite all his bravado the prime minister came to the same conclusion and because he is an election jivi and elections to five states including the all important state of up are around the corner and because defeat was staring him in the face he was left with no option but to withdraw these black laws in my tweet after the announcement i said while i congratulate the kisans on their victory over the government for the repeal of the farm laws i attach no noble sentiment to the government for this move it is a calculated step for the up elections for this government democracy begins and ends with elections so this is it nothing more than an election gimmick
bjp government total failure

do u know al economist and expert supported farm law
it is sad to see these illiterate farmers and their so called leaders with vested interests protesting for something fictitious like thinking that government will stop providing msps to farm produce to those who do not know a dime about the indian agriculture system my advice is google a little and gain some knowledge about the dire issues that this law intends to address it would have been fine if farmers were protesting after the govt has taken back the msp support which is never gonna happen because no political party is dumb enough to lose farmers vote which is about 70 of the working class it is a huge number believe me by cutting down msps

t 6 months going by bjp is latest hijacked lineage a riot 6 months ahead of elections is expected usually it would be against transporting beef or keeping 200 gms of mutton in fridge or a hindu girl marrying a non hindu man etc this time they got an easier enemy the farmer its a little late this time usually this would be done in september anyway i am happy that bjp didnt break its legacy and hige expectations of people like me welcome to the new world created by social media fired by human is oldest virtue gossiping and rumour mongering be it somebody wearing mask or somebody eating beef or somebody marrying somebody the mad crowd can easily generate an interest in that matter and that can be controlled by dubious politicians who appeared to have dedicated their entire life for bharat mata
upcoming election is the reason now not the lost of lives of farmers not the suffering not the welfare of farmers wow

you and most indian media are trying too hard to link the farmers protest to a khalistan movement this is your discredit agenda do not care what you call it we will support the farmers

up bihar madhya pradesh farmers were very happy with this new law now the poor farmers of these states will suffer and punjab rich farmers will enjoy

after all it is the government to decide about the laws it is our duty to support the farmers as of farmers are the backbone of a nation stand for them and support until the results are out
25 years ago adani roamed through the streets of ahmedabad on a vespa scooter today he plays in billions his start was dealing in fraudulent import replenishment licences import polyester yarn and exporting containers of mud or cheap leftover grain he made millions and hundreds of units in the polyester industry were shut down because of cheap imports including mine today he sits with our pm and they hatch new ways to loot india but he has been stopped in his tracks by punjab the destroyers of abdali ghazni and ghori other looters from afghanistan
not a single party flag
some wear tailored shawls keep long beards and works relentlessly for small farmers
people like rahul gandhi yogendra yadav and other so called kissan leaders have to be taken to task and held responsible for the violence also rajnath singh ji should be made the home minister again sad that these protesters hoisted a different flag on the ramparts of red fort on a republic day strong action is required i would like to add that the protests should have not been allowed in the first place will the court too take responsibility this has been done just to demean the modi government
let the small farmers suffer who cares

because farmers market and freedom for price of grains decrease and poor farmers cannot against any decisions farmers laws only for richest man or business men
farmers are fighting for middle class families also

people have the right to free movement no one should deliberately disrupt the livelihood and movement of people the farmer is protest is just that to create problems they and their kind should be punished to the maximum so that people do not adopt such actions can we go infront of their family homes and protest create ruckus and disrupt their movement for long period of time if yes public should do the same to these so call paid fake leaders
1984 victims were killed with tires on their heads most never got justice by police or the law instead the police helped them find by marking houses of sikhs the holy book of sikhs has been discriminated over 100 times in punjab with no culprits to be caught most of the time police instead fired upon and killed sikhs for protesting in 2015 against sacrilege cases again no justice or law
probably only 10 are farmers rest are paid by communists this happened because congress lost the election

bro china is agriculture is capitalist in nature since 1982
worst pm in the world modi

whatever the farmer does the minister and his son will never be arrested because bjp is ruling both at the center and in the state
punjabi farmers will not let any government implement this bill in their state
the problems that the farmers are facing wont be limited to the farmers alone they will next show up in the general society as well the current government has succeeded in placing the future of the next generation of children of this country into deep slavery by promoting endless privatization transferring wealth to the riches performing changes in rules that were protecting the democracy so far

feel proud on farmers respect
from 3 10 to 3 40 it explains everything that was wrong with the new farm laws punjab and haryana are the richest farming states in india and on the other hand you have bihar where the mandi system was eliminated and new reforms were presented in 2006 and yet they are still amongst the poorest in india this clearly proves beyond any shadow of a doubt that the new farm laws will not improve the economic conditions of the farmers but will definitely improve the profitability of a few large corporations which are close to this bjp regime
salute to our respected farmers what endurance courage perseverance

on the other hand this would naturally welcome private traders middlemen with their wealth resources education tech now how logistics etc and would be buying produce across states global at odd times with lowest price given to the indian farmers thereby these private traders middlemen will become hoarders and this evil would be disastrous for the indian farmers and the country

they are khalistanis

just before elections this so called farmers moved to haryana wow
sir now let us do some numbers here total rice and wheat production in india is around 123 mil tonnes and 110 mil tonnes respectively if the government plans to buy it all at msp then the total cost comes around 5 lakh cr our tax revenue is 11 lakh cr and that has a part of my income in it sir i sir am a tax payer unlike any of the rich farmers who never paid any tax and no political party has guts to even broach that topic i believe you pay taxes too would you kiss goodbye to education healthcare defense sanitation and infrastructure funding to buy wheat and rice at msp which is the artificially inflated price of these two commodities how about my sabziwala who goes street to street selling his farm grown perishable items he is a farmer too when was the last time you picked up a fight with govt for his safety net for his share of msp so sir please do not tell us that this was an all inclusive protest where every farmer from every part of the country was included and the reason for that is 88 of the farmers in the state of punjab and haryana sell their crop at msp for the farmers in rest of the country do your own digging sir and trust me youll be disappointed to know the numbers there

i condemn govt action on honest farmers shame on the govt
once again proved that seekhs brothers are known for bravery
people have the right to free movement no one should deliberately disrupt the livelihood and movement of people the farmer is protest is just that to create problems he and his kind should be punished to the maximum so that people do not adopt such actions can we go infront of their family homes and protest create ruckus and disrupt their movement for long period of time if yes public should do the same to these so call paid fake leaders

i dont diagree with your views however why not talk about solutions something that makes farmers more independent why not upskill them give them more authentic knowledge why not make a processing plants for a couple of villages together via fpcs why not demand more infra support limits and credits for fpcs help farmers become self sustainable and skilled why not give the farmers to the power to decide the rates at which they will sell their produce their products why not become independent of chemical farming and promote farmers for pro nature farming not sure why but most people do not want to address things at the root level why not
no msp no protests by kerala farmers

modi is the main in the world

when sc allowed protests stating it is the democratic right it has allowed anarchy and through this the farmers are responsible for spread of corina in line with the judgement of madras hc which said eci is criminally responsible for pandemic we can attribute the same charge against sc it should have banned the protest there is a clear understanding between judiciary opposition and farmers otherwise why not the judge who took suo moto case for vaccine issue it is a mute spectator on this issue very shame on them judiciary at its worst now a days not doing it is work of clearing backlogs but allowing protests etc even during pandemic is unheard of it is not taking up vaccine sold by a state for profit suomoto it is not taking up vaccine wastage by rajasthan why there is a clear nexus which is what it strikes me foreign lobby playing through all forums

to some extent the procurement policy of fci is responsible for lower prices of grains in open market if they could ensure smooth procurement and timely payment of dues to the farmers the market price could have remained marginally above the msp fci could then sell the excess grain in open market after booking some profit besides this more categories of msp for a grain is needed in consonance with the variety of the produce fci may also think of value addition and may itself become a supplier to the corporate fci solely for the purpose of pds is a very bad idea

the farmers have the right to use the vote politics card to get their legitimate demands met by the deaf regime of modi yogi cronies the government has used every dirty trick to malign weaken scare and harm the farmers vote politics is the only appropriate tool left for the farmers to use it is democratic it is legal it is non violent acceptable in all democratic countries so they have to take that route the media should not question or blame them this is different than entering politics or contesting elections

liberals would never support communism or any other authoritarian regime so not sure what you have put those two together as a liberal i have to agree that the goal the government is pursuing is good the reforms will harm allot of people who rely on farming the underlying idea is that small scale farming is unsustainable as they will not be able to compete with big farms corporations the government want is to quickly reform the farming sector with disregard to what will happen to farmers in my opinion the government should create a government farming fund that would issue out loans and grants to farmers for land acquisition and modernization and give out additional subsidies to those farmers that would want to sell their land and offer them financial incentive to change profession the government should also prevent land monopolization by judge corporations that want to enter or increase their hold on the farming market if the reforms are done right farms will become larger and more modernized and thus will be able to produce more produce that could be sold at cheaper prices the farmer will earn more the food will be cheaper the government should not leave behind those that decide or in a worst case scenario will be forced by the market to sell their land these people can start businesses that provide services for farmers poland went threw similar reforms and has done fairly well with it is farming market the government in poland has oversight over the farming industry as provides financial incentive lower taxes grants and low interest loans to farmers
do not call them warriors they are bullies cannot protect sikhs in afganistan and pakistan they are just showoffs

it is already impossible for the us to contain china is economic development the united states chose to contain china is economic development that is totally wrong it was very stupid because china is rise is inevitable if china is not the largest economy in 10 years it will be in 15 years at the latest at that time the united states was the second largest economy in the world if the us had not curbed india is economic development in another 20 years after 2050 india is total economy would have surpassed that of the us and india would have become the second largest economy in the world while the us would have become the third largest economy in the world when the united states from the largest economy to the second largest economy many countries will still listen to the united states but when the united states from the second largest economy to the third largest economy then how many countries will listen to the united states therefore the right thing for us to do is to contain india is economic development not china is when india is gdp exceeds 6 trillion or its per capita gdp exceeds 5 000 india is economy will show explosive growth and so will its science and technology and military it will take less than 10 years if the us had not contain india is economic technological and military development before then then india is economic technological and military development would have exploded in 10 years in 10 years when india is total gdp exceeds 6 trillion or when india is per capita gdp exceeds 5000 the us will not be able to contain india is economic development in another 20 years india will surpass us in gdp in the united states there are people of indian descent in high government offices in silicon valley technology companies in universities in the financial elite on wall street indians are also good at english computer programming intelligence gathering and controlling the us by controlling the indian ocean

that all the doubts farmers posed and will be tabled in next session of
fascism arise from arousal of survival instincts by the activation of dormant reptilian brain right of our head pingla nadi once awakened reptilian brain converts humans into wild wolf s fascists are best in similarity with gang rapists mafia gangs religious cult mob irrational crowd complete loss of empathy zero empathy is trademark of fascists just like cannibals
this cult does not care if the nation goes down the hill due to civid all they care about is pushing their agenda im sure none of them would hv read the texts of the laws

action on accused is and will be taken only due to the pressure by opposition
to bring any reforms in india a process of educating the farmers is paramount i do believe that mr modi always thinks in favour of the masses and in this case how to make farming very competitive with bigger returns there is no doubt reforms in farming is needed to take india to new levels however the farmers main concern were that the measures of reforms would benefit corporates and the corporates would dictate their terms to the farmers this aspect made them extremely uncomfortable
i was searching for knowledgeable video sorry i think i have arrived at wrong destination you please keep going
i there should be no political interference and no political representation should be tolerated it will work as an economic institution of govt of bharat under pmo only
other points were explained pretty well
poor research done on real matters dont just publish or make video based on personal opinions rather than documents or proofs
if enough individuals can be bought by internal and external money misuse any self serving agitation can be done to stall good changes population contains enough such individuals and geography is limited they can fill roads and highways and do violence on common people who have families to take care of 24x7

if people still wants to know more nicely then please check mr khan from patna very nice teacher
logic itself is flawed as they went to farmers protest to gain insights about govt vs farmer it would make more sense to also go to non protestors and understand why these laws will work technically sample space is skewed

what a fool you are this is obviously a bjp fanboy channel but why lie to bjp supporters there is zero benefit to farmers from these laws they only exist to enrich corporations the same corporations that fund the bjp the second they are repealed the protest will end modi and his goons are playing politics but the farmers just want to get on with their lives the hundreds of farmers who have died so far did not give their lives for politics this is not a game

sir you should have done this episode in hindi and in local language so that the farmers should have correctly understand these new farm laws
only god can save farmers yet the farmers will still loose for a fair price who will be left in the hands of middlemen hoarders and corrupt politicians who will control the price the rest of the farmers of india were so happy that they got a better price for their crops and accepted the agricultural laws leaving only punjab farmers under pressure from middlemen and foreign funds to protest who were not even paying tax and controlled the price shame
modi had to bow down to the power of the farmers

09 26 what was police doing
farmers from other states have never fought for their rights and thus msp was never given to them in first place now that we are doing that you are calling us anti nationalists secondly we do have intelligentsia we are not fools that we cannot see the bigger picture just because the flaws of this bill do not affect you you are ignorant this is real selfishness

to this end all the peoples of the world must unite to form a scientific democratic people is political party and by doing non violent and positive politics and form a scientific democratic people is political government and by providing right to education right to employment and right to health to all peoples of the world and if human humanity human equality and human resources created the world will flourish for well being

why sometimes onion became more than 100 per kilo and other vegetables at more than 50 per kilo simply the logic of apmc does not stand msp is here to stay and violent agitation on some hypothetical assumption is not acceptable thitrd why other states are not forthcoming with agitation fourth punjab and haryana are in the grip of organized syndicates of big farmers and since they are adversely affected they resort to such violent agitation
my question is why only punjabi farmers are protesting
silence on bengal violence is proof

i am so impressed with the selflessness and awareness of indian farmers there is only one point that is directly harming them other three seems to be apparently in favor of indian farmers yet they anticipated the harm of these in long term and how these laws will effect common person and decided to fight against it this level of selflessness can only be expected from a farmer may they be victorious

there are far too many problems the farmers are facing unfortunately for the policy making body this knowledge is not available hence even though sincere effort is being made by the government doubling of income would be only a dream  what is required at present is identifying all factors affecting his income look for solutions to each one to overcome the same if not possible what else can be done you need a systematic approach to solve the problem in my opinion we have not done the homework to solve the problem we are all living in fools paradise ultimate sufferer is the farmer his woes we have no knowledge

haryana lots of love from punjab
otha mairu
what deeply pains me is the fact that this decision to repel was made on heavy political encumbrance and not on the entirety of the farm law bjp made the mistake of not carrying out due diligence with farmer stakeholders in the first place and was very haste with the farm law a much wiser and inclusive decision should have been made on a sector like agriculture that contributes over 15 of the country is gdp and employs over 50 of the population directly and indirectly thou i totally agree with good number of the farmers grievances but personally i was in favor of the farm law and sad that it has to go away like this i feel even sadder this law has to be scrapped under the political burden and not because of the law itself
punjab saved indian democracy once again

the power of election turned him into desh bhasi pyari
but nowhere in the world any government gives or even assures minimum prices for any thing you make non agriculture so why should farmers get that benefit why are farmers growing wheat which is of lower variety just because they are assured of a price even for bad quality because the first buyer need to give pan number to the farmer government and then the black economy presently booming due to misuse of agriculture income

indian culture and socity
you libreals dont understand anything first of all the farmers are using this as a chance to revolt against the state picking up the idea of sikh independence this is a notion of uneducated people there is no evidence that big corporations will make the farmers loose money why dont you actually discuss that and the reason they are protesting they are killing people
bjp criminal party worse than east india company
the opposition party does not care for farmers
if this is farmer protest why we see only punjab punjabi is sikhs here this is the crux of the issue its not a farmer protest
all drama started now before election like taking farmers law back reducing 10 rupees on petrol after increasing 50 on petrol master in acting wah

actually farm bill is benefiting farmers this just a political gimeack

very nicely explained sir
this guys going to create problem again
we support modi against this deshdrohi
let the national interest prevail
and as modi said in the parliament our dear sikh brothers did a lot for our country than any other community besides tata is parsis aside they give their blood for its safety on the borders and no one can deny this they are the most respected jovial and loved community across india let us sit and talk about what can be done alternatively that will not cause any major loss to them
and i think here farmers are right
no one believes that the existing apmc system is good but the opposition to these new laws is not just coming from those who believe in socialist solutions there is also the example of the successful milk cooperative movement in gujarat is amul and its offshoot mother dairy what stopped the modi government from introducing new laws that would facilitate fund and legally protect such cooperatives in farming that is a question even the greatest votary of capitalist farming cant answer
election is also there in an important state in next few months
7 msp already done for benefits of actual farmers
the best moment in video is
one side indian media is showing that pakistan and china is funding in farmer protest and second side showing that pakistan is so poor that even a child cannot afford a sweet so how they can invest in india is protest and china hmara mama lgta h ai joh protests mai invest kregi dimmag kholo andbhagaton use your brain
how you guys judge people without any evidence or solid proof they are not farmers
excellent leader rakesh ji we are with you sir
ye to taleban ke pass he jutt q bol rahe ho

2 the third bill intention was to bring a third party organization into farming and protect farmers from famine and other natural disasters while also increasing the diversity of agricultural products which is currently very limited due to a lack of certainty in post harvesting incomes looking at how much wheat production is increasing in up mp and punjab and how mp recently crossed 300 mt of wheat production in the year 20 21 which getting wasted due to very poor storage facilities so the clarity would come from a proper dialogue with farmers and curbing the weak areas of laws to make them legible and clearer which i think goi tried up to some extent but we all saw what exactly happened if the implementation of these bills had been effective with proper clarity then it would have made farmers more confident and secure so they could have started thinking toward other farming options and processes and may eventually shift towards organic farming as well
but inside we will not
excellent work watching third time keep it up
modi drama vote for congress only

only if the government and the police was more strict this would have not happened killing some of them would have been better than such a disrespect to the country removing the country is flag on its independence day sad
loopholes in long run private mandis may overrun the govt mandis and govt mandis may end as a result farmers will have no choice but to sell their crops to private mandis which may provide low price for their crops
this government is disgusting
okay so basically i support modi and i dont need to give you a reason cuz its just politics yk

farmers demands are genuine the govt has thrown a blind eye for the past 11 months on farmers protest the centre must withdraw the farm laws with immediate effect
we have seen the way they tried to run over police personnel in delhi on independence day this region was in the thick of khalistani activism in the 80 is activist attacked the transiting vehicles as they tried to escape in their vehicles sikh we have seen they way they tried to run over police personnel in delhi on independence day migrant farmers own and occupy large tracts of benami farm lands owned by clearing forest and pastoral lands in the terai regions fearing government action there has been conflicts over several decades
somebody is so smart that they saw pelting stone in the 1st video

your findings are right but it has some loopholes i come from a farmers family we grow two crops every year and in my locality everyone does the same if not 2 grain crops then one legume and one grain so practically the no remains same it will not increase by 1 5 or 150 percent also yield of rice is more at some places hectare then wheat you cant rally relate anyways other findings are great
you were asking for repeal and then discuss it kind of funny move on and try to do something useful

salute you sir for speaking the truth
from this information we can easily understand why grains in international markets are cheaper when compared to that of india heavy agricultural subsidies by usa and other countries is the main reason for less production costs in other countries instead of increasing farm subsidies india is trying to handover agricultural lands to foreign companies who have lots of advantages like subsidies from their governments and also availability of loans at zero interest

just fyi the crux of the laws were first brought in by the upa govt which were opposed by the bjp then in the opposition and the consequences of the laws will reduce the dependence on middlemen and make the producers or famers richer2 will incentivise agri diversification meaning growing lesser water guzzling crops 3 will reduce stubble burning considerrably meaning the capital region will be relieved of the notorious toxic smog that engulfs the capital in the winter months and suffocates the population
modi ji this was your best reform should have implemented it in bjp ruled states
and it is interesting to note that on an average india provides 48 rs 3600 per farmer as agricultural subsidy annually where as america provides 7000 rs 5 25 000 subsidy per farmer total subsidy by indian governments is rs 3 20 000 crore 42 billion surprisingly indian government garners 40 billion annually from farm exports usa provides 132 billion rs 9 63 600 crore to its farmers annually usa also gets income from farm exports to the tune of 132 billion annually usa provides 132 billion rs 9 63 600 crore to its farmers annually value of farm produce in india and the usa are same in dollar terms 130 billions by the way let us also know how much other countries subsidize their agriculture china 212 billion indonesia 28 billion japan 65 billion

the government surrendered to a small group of corrupt middlemen it has set the template that would be now used on every progressive reforms that india needs
this protest was for the arihants who were the via media for the farmers who made their money making networks for themselves and actually made cartels to squeeze the farmer god help them only punjab will have mandis the rest of the state is will move on
are they from pakistan unfortunately indian minister are unaware of their respect feilds problems why govmt want to impose bill if farmers are not willing and who is actual beneficiaries
modi government makes arrangements for all minorities
where can we contact you
an accident these are democracy killers the media
today congress is trying to be so aggressive on farm bill
many of those fakes on social media have no any iidea how many farmers still survive in india does govt have any actual count even do you have any idea how many farmer suicides happen in india none of these bills were properly discussed in parliament same as many other disastrous policies bjp govt have brought about what are you trying to prove we do not want your dictatorship in this country being a democratic country first the govt should open their listening ears if farmers do not want the bills just trash it and have discussions with them to settle it amicably why are they unable to do that does that sound any alarm

if the laws are repealed modi govt will learn its lesson that the indian constitution and india is federal structure cannot be kicked out of the window we are not open to fascism and anarchy and single party system and dictatorship not necessarily in that order
rss goons that is what imran khan says
this guy is fucking slow
just shows how if government would have since the start tried to bring equality in income levels among regions this could not have happened why didnt green revolution work for all states why infrastructure lacks in some states just why
this would make the hindustan times value great
on a public note i would suggest this decision is good as we have seen in many developed countries they provide some kind of subsidy to their farmers please sir i respect you but atleast provide full information on both the sides of the coin
these farmers are actually from punjab and haryana
chor bjp godi modia and lundbhkats are hramkhors

in this context tekat sahib is absolutely right
so now you know they are kisan
why the interview was cut suddenly
congratulations everyone who supported these people you won
amazing sir narrated by principal is also very nice overall it is really beautiful to see the root problems facing by the farmers
bjp leader chor hai
i stand with farmer
our country is heading towards dictatorship death of democracy
3 the only issue is with those stupid and shameless politicians who want to keep farmers uneducated idiots
the fundamental mistake in approach which is being done by indians is to look at bjp as a political party because it is not period
why bjp rep disturbing the other panelist
taliban afghanistan kabul do not fight each other you should love each other do not let china own other countries they have own country we have own country and own culture let is spread love and peace watching from manila philippines
bjp will do time pass with rrb ntpc candidates and farmers like before 2022 is going to be a year of protests
education
farmers already told about farmers law what they will face on implementing it
the whole farmer protest is a comedy
it is an embarrassment to humanity cruel act by government against farmers
human right commission walo kaha ho aap log
sir ground reality of present protest is the msp is not included in new policy farmers want it should be added in writing not verbal on tv channels govt has refused to purchase makee at msp rate of 1600 per quintal fixed by govt says farmers r free to cell elsewhere tpt cost will boost further pvt agencies are not ready pay more than 600 per quintal for makee against msp of 1600 farmers say either govt purchase makee at msp or order pvt agencies to purchase at msp
this is a great win for farmers and for all of india
worst person in india holding a constitutional post he is just a pimp a thug and a traitor
please remember 600 farmers has lost their life please keep that in mind vote wisely
time just just wall it off and let them all kill each other
very less quantity is procured by govt each year concept of msp is not wrong msp price is minimum price should be paid the price should not fall below this certain limit private middlemen should also fallow this this is expection
all politics pre planned created it seems clearly
no march of farmers but unmanaged crowd
the aimless jews at the time of messenger were satisfied with worldly life they even wished to live here for a thousand years but their long life did not benefit them for identifying their sins since they rejected the lord is book
just now hearing about this
3 no help from judiciary
we are in the state of dictatorship narendra modi is ideologically following nazis in germany
after 2019 every year new drama start
these police are unfit first they approved the protest on 26th second they were unprepared third they did not use force to suppress violence he is talking so childish that they promised to be peaceful
its fake it is was a conspiracy they were not real farmerss they were bought people aka so called farmers who did this we have credibility in farmers protest
if government is really concerned about farmer then why the not mention msp
shanta kumar is data 2012 13 your data 2019 20 clear proof of substantial increase in the procurements in the last 7 years time large farmers benefit more than small farmers and marginal farmers do not get msp benefit my own assessment from field ground reality thanks
modi defeated zindabad long live small farmers
congratulations today the country won and the dictatorial government gave up
and i want say within few weeks it will 1year complete farmer protest so we will support them becoz godi media will not support they will defamed them

its so hard to reform anything in india i do not think repelling the law is the best for farmers they should have given state an option to opt in for farm laws farmers are already suffering with mandis a parallel bargaining power could have been good for farmers but they failed to understand that
abp news fake news chennal
tikait is absolutely right
dont trust vice news anymore showing only one side of story not good

another very good video and unbiased i am very grateful that you put such genuine effort in all your videos and a lot of us are becoming more aware but unfortunately even then things are not improving i agree that maybe from another perspective things would have improved but then when i look at some basic things i do not see anything has changed

not merely india has this problem all nations had colonial past has this experience interestingly the evertwhile still mudddle with the issues as we see bbc still carries its colonial agenda and so are the western push in academics so deceptively
do not underestimate the podrmawer of real farmers whn they rise no one stands tall then them
this is not just mistake of government mistake of farmers is that they do not learn new methods and market and just want everything from government and do not want to user their own brain to learn new things in farming most of them are uneducated and never learn anything on the other side government mistake is that they did not asked for opinions of farmers and pass this bill on their own no government can help farmers other than education whether it is modi govt or any other upcoming govt this is same don t blame govt of everything i see attitude of punjab is so much relying on govt
f k you beggers if modi farmers win protest

very fundamentally important actions needed india can t afford to loose jaffna peninsula nothern eastern srilanka land mass sl tamilian s mutual win win bond inorder to counter threat thru southern tip from china please takeover jaffna peninsula under indian control right now before it gets too late develop jaffna peninsula as part of indian territorial security zone sl politicians are bunch of fools may dance for  by selling their country s land mass to china tamil nadu and southern tip of india is extremely important for indian defence economic security spending on defence is important but positioning extending the defence and security zones beyond to jaffna srilanka s land mass is much more important
one of the criminals who hung there also mocked and taunted him arent you the messiah save yourself and us  but the other criminal rebuked him have you no fear of god you are under the same sentence as he for us it is plain justice we are paying the price for our misdeeds but this man has done nothing wrong  and he said jesus remember me when you come into your kingdom  he answered i tell you this today you shall be with me in paradise   luke 23 39 43

unless there is an hidden agenda
this type of decisions force youths to take action toward true democracy like      
yes they are fully justified to protest
even patience has a limit what this stupid modi govt is trying to do has surpassed everything it seems even judiciary is staggering to express itself on many issues of the govt the only available mode is people is movement to resist the evils
its truly very very very bad indian politicians ko todi shiksana dena bahoot jaroori hai
18 05 couple of points 1 if contract done for 2000 company cannot arbitrarily reduce price afterwards and have to honor it as per the rule 2 if company offers contract price of 500 down from 2000 for next contract why the presenter says that the farmer does not have a choice the farmer is still free to contract with someone else offering higher price or he she may choose to cultivate whatever and sell it in apmc at msp price as that structure is still present
if government want taxes then they can talk if not then get lost

during life what is your achievement and what you give this country except to negativity
one point that you also did not covered is what will be the implications of the msp when it is legalized on the budget of the central govt and the scenario today when govt had to buy on msp and to baire some lacs of crores of rupees of losses every year there is even more to this subject that you missed

the akali dal and ncp can be seen begging in the next election
why would the minister resign when his son just did the dirty work modi always wanted to do
for all foreigners who do not know whats going on these protest are politically motivated and only 2 sates are participating in it as the state govt of these states is highly corrupt and had whole wholesale market under its monopoly and they used to buy produce at low cost and sell it the new laws are just a way to bypass their monopoly and that is why these states are protesting all of them are political party workers not real farmers real farmers do not act like this
dear sir agreed that punjab and haryana farmers are doing well and they want the current status quo to continue but there are other farmers in the rest of india who want to scale up and do something for example kerala farmers are all ready to scale up on jack fruit powder and are making arrangements for cold storage system which will be made available through fpo farmer producer organizations like this there are many many examples if punjab and haryana are happy with status quo then so be it
thankyou ma am its really clear all doubts on farm bill waiting foe more videos like this

what will happen if they get sick delhi hospital are already overloaded people are dying on roads punjab government should stop them if somebody loose their loved ones they only feel the pain
what many people dont understand 1 central govt does not have budgetary resources to buy entire product of all farmers around india that is why they do not want to make it a law otherwise they will be bound to buy everything economically and fiscally this is impossible 2 apmc mandis are strongly cartelised meaning only few people can buy from there becoz getting license is very difficult and costs a lot 5lacs so these traders buy produce at low prices eventually hurting farmers also small farmers do not have money to take their produce by tractor to mandi pay taxes and storage cost till produce is sold by legitimising outside mandi sale this will help them legally sell outside mandi farm laws have been in implementation in m rashtra for over a decade and now and mandis are still intact 3 conflict resolution problem is genuine this is something that govt should consider 4 repeal of essential commodities act will benefit traders who will now want to buy produce to sell at higher price without govt intervention even if we imagine that this will lead to steep prices will it not lead to many people beginning to trade to sell at slightly lower price than competition to be at a profit this will ultimately ensure correct prices this basically is the essence of market economics i e to promote efficiency through competition and self interest
india is a violent country do not tell me about afganistan pakistan and other countries in reply i know about that these countries are violent too but you should not defend your wrong things by other is wrong things
no farmers no food remember it
farmers need the atmosphere if they produce 50 kg of food grains they can sale 25 to 30 kg for private according to govt guidelines or for govt which if for food security of the society remaining stock can be sold for different market at the right time for that they need a storage infrastructure and trading platform just like share trading

slaves can u buy oil with inr
2 they were saying that police and army are their brothers if one person in a family is a farmer another is in the police or army they said now they have attacked the police who were showing restraint how come
not clear and confusing are the roads being cleared or not nothing mentioned about it
fed up of these farmers
this protest is organically done by the people of india against the puppet government which rules india
please wait and see what is the outcome of taking back the farm laws their is a lot big happening inside and outside the country this with drawn farmlaws are check mate
mitron jumla feku modi bowed down to khalistanis farmers laws to be repealed sabka saath sabka vikas all bakwas only vinaaash
i cant understand are right or the others are right i understand the concern but they are doing too much they should not kill people
i request modi government take strict action immediately they are not farmers they are fake farmers and tukde tukade gang
also they stated that the market share of agriculture went down from 50 in the 1960s to 15 in the 2010s this is not necessarily due to the agriculture industry not being able to keep up with the other industries but due to the exponential rise of other industries such as it and manufacturing the gdp of india in the 1960s was approx 50 billion and in the 2010s rose to approx 2 8 trillion
farmers voice is matter in this 2021 elections
nothing can fix a stupid farmers were crying with old rules and were committing suicides so government changed the old rules and removed the middleman these idiots have not even used the new law and they are already protesting politics of protest these idiots are doomed no one can save them
indira gandhi type leadership is missing today
thanks u so much sir

which indian party tried to makes ordinary farmers terrorist
ndtv make a correction these are farmers of haryana and punjab not whole country we are supporting it
1 how many of you know that at the borders of the delhi where agitation was going on 28 woman were raped and killed missing by these fake farmers

modiji and bjp are different entities
you are meant to serve the people
dear u r saying without doing good study
7 41 please song name
people of haryana requested khattar saab ko take care of these farmers else they were threating to take on the farmers themselves

so then shd modi just wait for 50 years for reforms else donot do anything now atleast he can sleep peacefully that he tried
gali gali main shore hai modi kala chore hai this is what the children are shouting in the protest
vote the right politician of your city its does not matter if they are from xyz parties
very veyy helpful boss very well explained
i think they are not real farmers they are middlemen thats why their bussinesses are finished after this law so thats why they are protesting real farmers are getting benefit of this law by that law they can sell their goods directly in market
people power weve all got it well done to those farmers
msp is still there n will be there
what about balance 94 of farm production
as farmers if we are still dependent on a company govt to solve our problems it would never happen lets do it ourselves lets come together to create fpo with no entry for politics inside it to make sure it benefits the farmers with policies created by the farmers the policy makers are never farmers and they never understand the ground reality so let the farmers make it themselves and contain it locally
money process could be powerful or weak decision makes the process and good decision makes good process people will
4 many lawyers put various ways of thinking and agitations main theme would be surprisingly be found with more points which were not at all on discussion initiation
ndtv is seriously rubbish why he has added q beep sound when the person is trying to say truth
anarchy won and democracy lost
the reality behind the farm laws
it means the protest is basically run by arthis and mandis by only those people who have monopoly
lallantop is subsidiary company of aajtak so no doubt news will be fabricated and see how smartly anchor saying that as per aaj tk reporter post mortem report says that bodies of bjp activists who died in lakhimpur kheri had signs of injury that proves that they were beaten up by sticks nd rods now who is playing with mind of public here she simply wanted to insert a thought into minds of whosover watching this news that bjp activists were beaten up and killed by farmers
after farm bill is withdrawn
video was very very informative thank you very much
no matter what running over another human is a crime first justice should me made upon the rude son and asked union minister to resign we all indian has seen the thar running over the protesters
please someone explain why are they protesting if pvt mandis are already successful in maharashtra
your movement has been hijacked by khalistanis and anti social elements first understand that dont blindly support anyone there are always different people in a protest with different intentions
imagine american leaders being honest about their failures i salute modi for having the courage to change the wrong done us just killed an innocent afghan family and will never apologize
farmers who defeat our slave mind pm

china too does not want full scale war and is keeping diplomatic channel open india should start including tibetan origin general or tibetan national in talks
majority voters vote bjp ko de aur phir mudde andolonkari opposition denge aur bjp supremo unke demands sune kya itna chutiya hain 56 inch has he no guts to say those bloody rapists looters to go to public with these as election manifestos and win election and do whatever they like 56 inch is leading the country to total anarchy
that guy is a
shitty media
i again repeat these laws are not compulsory farmers will sale whomever he wants not only to middlemen farmers will go for contract farming if he likes actually the whole issue about law 1 which frees farmer from middlemen
thankyou maam for clearing all the doubts
democracy means total corruption of every bureaucratese every representatives no justice in the society as a result the masses are deprived from justice stagnation of development progress creating more more war lords dividing society on races sects
where fans treat celebs as god but when problem arise they do not have guts to talk
he is not a poor farmer
but the farming community not believing him keeping in view all his false promises made in the past they are contunuing their struggle until the laws are originally repealed by parliament
this is so sad please do something for them asap this is torture no one deserves this my goodness
its time for educated ppl to come in to farming just like australians did and finally agro industry boomed cus till goons are their leaders and uneducated farmers are just being played this will never change
this channel shud be banned

haryana formers protest lathicharge

now i think gov has to change 2nd bill but rest 2 are good and farmers and gov need to talk and understand each otherand sir your explanation was too god

fake government who is making monopoly on country
the kangress aap are also was involved in all these anti national activities they will do anything to get power just plain low life cowards
so punjab and haryana farmers keep producing these resource intensive crops like paddy sugarcane sell all to government government exchequer bears all brunt ultimately the common tax payers with private sector money flow technical expertise and demand they can start growing high yield crops benefit themselves and the companies so basically haryana and punjab farmers want things to stay as it is as they fill up the fci quota hmmpf
make sure every citizen is a farmer before any other employment punjab and up is nothing to the country no idiot can destablise the nation needs close watch and stern warning jai bharath any agitation thorough beating wakeup hindu jai bjp
i am thankful of bbc
i request u to plz attach the pdf of any laws that u r discussing in the video so that we can also read it

lol india has always been in this case that they do not give others dues pakistan stands firmly with our sikh brothers there and muslims in kashmir they have been suffering with radical modi and hindus

while the farmers fears are legit why fear about something that has not happened yet how do they know for certain that the pvt companies will exploit them when the bill has not even been put to practice
from this i am getting a feeling that farmers r not the one who actually are protesting but it is the buyers of these farmers are making them to protest stating that the farm laws will lead them to bad conditions may b
media are disappointing they should have educated farmers on the benefits and cons of farmer laws
humble request to farmers to stop all protests

jai kisan jai kisan andolan i appreciate the ideology of congress i shall continue to vote for and support congress
we support farmers from our hearts
the bill was intended for a greater good and for letting farmers get their fair bit of share by open sales and not restricted to mandis a kind of win win situation however the fear is the gaint companies who will offer to buy their goods are going to impose laws and regulations which will go against the common good of farmers and eventually they will start losing their inheritance on their assets moreover the law will allow third party mass buyers to decide the rate and in due competence farmers will be compelled to sell at lower price than their profitable prices even i thought bill was good later on hearing multiple agendas and possibilities i reside against it
no mask no distance no control all state govts have become slaves of this fellow

there are ways to protest but some bills which is not beneficial to your state does not make it necessary that it will not be beneficial to other states regulate do not abolish
you must ask every farmer fighting against these reforms that now onwards how would any govt dare to reform any sector especially the agricultural sector this agitation was just a reputation tussle not any logical base
these farmers are not indians they are rioters paid by pakistan china and other anti india forces
modi i am the nation i am the strongest
they only want to portray sikhs in the wrong light and give sikhs a bad name similar to what doordarshan did in 1984 why havent they showed up protesters
it is to make agriculture a business

i dont understand this point of govt should expand their purchase to more markets why should they to keep buying more than required and waste tax payer public money which otherwise could be used to build infrastructure for farmers build better technology for farmers to use and expand their markets to sell already govt purchase has gone beyond their limits and loss to exchequer why we r behaving like educated fools and getting carried away in this protest govt should not engage in any business they should concentrate on building infrastructure engage agri ministry agri universities and village panchayat to create framer procurement organisations fpo and through them every farmer can sell their products to either mandi or outside mandi however farmer wishes and gets better price its better to move away from mandi while making no impact to farmers and also get benefit for end users in all this we forget about general public who bare and burden 1 pay tax 2 pay higher roll price for products be grains or pulses or the processed products why should public suffer at the cost of others benefit for years and years when public will ever get any benefit let rich farmers give away their subsidies given they have better standard of living they way general public have given away subsidies for gas let the rich farmers help their farmer brother who have less land or no land but work as labour to get benefit from new laws and facilities provided by govt or any association that set up to help farmers to produce more and get better pricing

india has a huge farmer debt problem that needs to be fixed first to ensure that we remain self sufficient
the farmers protest is against the farmers bill and want it to be scrapped the sc has put stop on law is implementation but this is not farmers demand they want laws to be scrapped
this govt does not fight shy of reforms they have after all tightened the umbilical cord in kashmir with a motherly hug and severed the cord in air india with no more than a shrug

every one cannot be satisfied in democracy so it is a wrong decision taken by our indian government

these so called farmers have self exposed them jai hind
if this is such an evil bill then why are not farmers from other parts of the country protesting in fact many other farmers more than the ones protesting on highways and causing civil unrest support the bill
which allows the farmers to directly sale they produce to the whoever they want
it was a good and practical explanation and you have brought good rationality to your thought so as not to be at both extremes but rather discused from its implecations and possible outcomes you did however miss some of the main points of these bills
govt ruined farmers parade by sending their own goons in police uniforms they r killing farmers they lead them to go to red fort by bericating the proper route their all planing are getting failed everyday farmers protest still growing even more than before

may all beings be kind and supportive of each other
norma single question about masks and social distancing i wonder if samdish n co were afraid or just biased
i wonder why did i vote for modi when all high moral grounds are expected only from priyanka
the intention of tikait is to create chaos
i remember modi promised more than 10 million 1 crore jobs in 2014 and i do not see that fulfilled
repealed farm laws but what about the people who lost their lives you cannot give them back to their families many people lost their father brother husband brother in law father in law some people are the only bread n butter earners for the family who will give them back
when the discussion is on only msp then why are they asking to repeal the laws
why pakistanis cant see that their pathan brothers dont want any division border or separation between them they are such a peaceful sons of their opium growing soil true flag bearers of peaceful faith

what is this going on where is law now and where is justice
the nature of his occupation too suffers a disability his goods are perishable he cannot store withhold his produce beyond 1 or 2 months and wait for the prices to become favorable there is tight schedule for meeting his liabilities sowing the next crop and so on
the govt broke the back bone of the common man by introducing demonetisation jeopardising jobs and small businesses all over the country
so far farmers have been ignored by all governments and conditions are getting worse why should people have no say in democracy for laws passed for them and that too unconstitutionally in democracy supporters of the laws needed to make their case before passing the law not afterwards that is dictatorship so learn your constitution first for your rights as citizens and functioning of government in democracy now it is farmers soon it can be you rights pay attention to what ravish kumar is reporting

another argument is that contract farming will benefit the farmers because they will get an assured price pre written in the contract they say that this will give them a better price such as to at least cover their input costs some economists suggest that the laws will empower the farmers into a commanding position where they would be able to dictate their own terms and prices if that is really so then why does not the government jump in and write an msp

corrupted ministry
you do not need tell the farmer they know everything only this is a political game agitation is nothing all those people who came to dharns they come for free food and shelters anybky any where in the world if there is free food band shelters you can bring the people so govt is not worried about the agitation but the govt have a right to take action against those who vendslise the property is they should be held responsible but modi is not doing anything this is a big failures on the part of modi now it is the right time for modi to pick up his jhola and go back to himalaya and the yogi should be the pm and he deserves because he is the real the

the extent of biasness in this video hats off
these reform bills represents a blunder by the govt in assuming and equate our indian farmer as to be an american farmer farmimg system as an example in america unlike our nation bharat india there are few farmers each with with huge farming lands and privileged with requisite resources education computer tech logistics and above all america govt has obligatory provisions a binding by law of subsidies to the american farmers whereby american farmers have the built in inheirted capacity to act as private business themselves without any middlemen so to effectively economically manage their produce ensuring definite profit margins but in india bharat with our huge populace of small land holding farmers our farmers at large are not inherited with their personal private individual threshhold of resources education internet comupter knowhow paper documents works logistics requisite to enable them to manage marketing of their produce

shame on u

victory of good over evil
i have closely analysed the 3 bills what they do is they completely disrupt any control and benifits the farmers have now fakes on social media who pretend to be farmers are not the real farmers of this country and when you disrupt the way those genuine poor hard working farmers operate you are killing the last hope of this nation and making the people of this nation slaves to corporates your reforms are allowing the corporates to take up the control do you have any idea how corporates work and treat the people ask me all those fake idiots on social media just analyse the data across the globe india is the only country where an individual could survive with such a small income that is made possible only because we were able to keep the corporates in check now wirhin 7 years the fakes have managed to disrupt the economy to the core and it is beyond repair now and when they now do the same to our farming sector should the farmers keep their mouth shut and allow this country to be taken over by corporates no as long as you kill the last of us patriotic indians we will continue to protest just trash the bills and work with farmers the real sons daughters of india

legal rights taken away every indian will be affected by this bill the most unjust imbalance of power the law gives immunity to all civil servants central and state governments or any other person in respect of anything which is in good faith done or intended to be done under this act or of any rules or orders made hereunder so acceptance of the bill gives immunity to civil servants against legal action for crimes they have yet to commit in good faith indian citizens will be excluded in right to legal recourse it is very dangerous as it erodes the rights of every citizen
its time for the real farmers who supported the bill and come in support in large numbers let the people see how many were against it middlemen and how many were in support

very disappointing that rich farmers of punjab who do not give a rupee of tax and take hundreds of benefits like urea subsidy fertilizer subsidy forced govt to move back on a progressive law no option for govt when there is competitive populism the unbelievable amount of competitive populisim which is going on in bengal delhi etc in long run does no good i am myself from bengal and ashamed of the ruthless populist measures taken by local govt just for vote bank which does no good in long run

as far as protesting farmers of state of punjab and haryana are concerned there only demand should have been the exemption of their states in the act and nothing else as it would be unreasonable to ask for grants from the government despite the latter is giving out huge sums of subsidies without being asked for
may i ask about fine extra tax given to farmers if company take backstep is not good for farmers ki agr farmers vo legal notice s c m dikha de to company ko kitna fine dena hoga
mainstream media is so misguided and biased the protesters are so united and non violent they know what they are talking about and what they are fighting for
the farmers failed to understand good laws but when such laws are rushed they are bound to fail if bjp had asked gandhi is party to propose the bill as their manifesto idea that bjp will support as govt giving them credit for their idea and passed as oppositions bill with bjp is amendments

progressive farm laws have been repealed on the context of failure in getting some farmers of 2 and a quarter state on board in a large country is a problem since its shows victory of mobocracy and anarchy the template is laid out and succeeded in demonstrating that reforms are not possible if a few rich farmers individuals take the streets despite a thumping majority its a pity bjp is not winning punjab neither khalistani threat is going away with this move rather government has projected weakness and cluelessness opposition will use this template for sure but its not good for the country since external forces and think tanks of china pakistan and khalistani terrorists have taken congnisance too

modi controls media and controls what they show on tvs
i dont understand what shekhar says only in a free market there are possibilities for many intermediaries between the producers and the consumers in the regulated market there is only one government agency between them when there is excess supply prices fall in a free market and the msp is only discretion that the government may or may not exercise but in the regulated market there can be political and public pressure on the government to give msp for the farm products in india our farm production has far exceeded our need that is the reason why farmers prefer a regulated market where msp is assured from the farmers point of view their opposition to the free market is in their interest

perfectly explained sir g
this is an good video explaining the details of the implications of the farm laws here are a few more explanations for the benefit of viewers point wise 1 is this threatening coop federalism no farmers right to sell their produce to whomever wherever whenever whatever quantity cannot be infringed upon the entry 26 enables states to regulate trade in agricultural commodities subject to entry 33 in the concurrent list which deals with trade with food stuff cereals doubling farm income can occur with such market reforms also with article 249 centre can enact law in national interest of saving farmers from exploitation by middleman

when the constitution has given the right to the states to make the laws on agriculture produce any laws made by the centre have no legal status so where is the question of repealing these bills the state governnents cannot implement these laws the hon ble president should realise that he has been hoodwinked into signing these bills and show some responsibilty call for a joint session of parliament and question the government s unconstiturional way of functioning which is moving towards destruction of democracy

the supreme court has to understand that the reason for farmers to continue their protest is because of its temporary stay on implementing the idiotic farm bills it has to abolish the farm bills once for all and this is the only permanent solution the supreme court must act as per the directions from the indian constitution and not as per the directions from the ruling government
chaplusi krna band dy channel aap news government ki
sc should be blamed in a way for this for its comment to govt to clear the roads even after knowing that this govt is capable of bloodshed did the sc really want this to happen
the main issue isnt that punjabi farmers dont trust the central government its that mandis are much much larger in punjab and haryana then anywhere else in this nation and mandis will become weaker due to these bills and many farmers even in these states are happy with these bills this is because that cost of transportation is reduced and proper infrastructure would be provided by the private player and talking about the msp you can find out the msp which the government provides on their website the msp has increased compared to last year
agree that msp is also not sustainable an alternative is to abolish msp and increase subsidies on farm inputs like fertilizers seeds pesticides and encourage collective farming at the panchayat level whereby productivity multipliers like tractors harvesters etc the costs of which can be shared by the whole village equitibly the govt will get more bang of its buck this way
our control and we have our own rights in todays world very very
sp has its army of goondas

5 deregulation of food items there is no deregulation of any commodity because there was no regulation of any commodity regulation existed only on markets in order that markets facilitate proper weighment proper price formation process however despite the apmc regulation even to this day farmers are given bili chiti white slips which are totally not transparent even after 55 years of apmc act farmers are still receiving a very low price share out of the consumer rupee because of market inefficiencies and market imperfections and several practices such as undercover sales illegal deductions by merchants exploitation of farmers in interlocked markets cartels among merchants depressing the prices and so on

the farm laws were being used to create a wedge between hindus and sikhs in punjab and the khalistan movement was piggy backing on it and a full fledged return to terrorism was the next step
the people who commits crime or who cheats people are allowed to wander espace but the people who protest peacefully for their right with valid reasons are targeted all time everybody should think and thank the farmers before they eat
these are   
i m from naraingarh this is correct

not agree on many points there is no credibility of present government keeping the historical records in mind even conceding to amendments simply means that there are faults in acts besides being unconstitutional and classic examples of colourable legislations please read the provisions of the constitution
the three farm bills have created fear and unrest the farmers are fully aware of the implications these bills will have and understand the long term effect it can have on their livelihood and dignity
very bad government modi
what a stupid news report
say sorry for noteban also
mam why have you muted the vedio pls unmute it then say you bustard

where agriculture privatisation lead to monopoly and just assumption can not be made a valid argument we should wait for supreme court
some economists say that only 6 of the farmers benefit from the msp what they hide is the fact that these 6 farmers produce 90 of the foodgrains this is a figure that dates back to 2013 the situation today is very different and a more realistic recent data is that about 35 farmers have started using the msp facility in any case these figures have many caveats and errors one can keep digging and soon begin to see a maze of questions and puzzles but the question is how these figures of 6 or 35 justify into the decision of scrapping the msp

this law was so good
modi has single handedly won all elections since 2002
this is real bad that guy had no reason to run over the policemen there is a way to protest each government wanted to pass these laws and now everyone is playing politics around it the opposition and govt should work together to strengthen the laws as they are not good for farmers in the current form even the prevailing system can be manipulated so there has to be some amendment done to protect small farmers
i am not quite sure if the govt actually bowed down to farmers and sikhs or khalistani and middlemen hope it is the former

dear illiterate northiess why south farmers should suffer for duffer and broker of north india no south state farmers protested and we have to suffer without reforms make seperate laws for south india and we dnt want foolish north indian politics we need farm laws which is long pending request

these people will definitely help modi win 2024 with 350 seats while getting 0 seats from punjab
jungle only sthageet karwai no discussion
the underlying problem that presenter highlighted in most of the drawbacks is apprehension that govt would abandon and cease to exist as a player hence leading to exploitation by private entities but the government has assured that it would not cease to exist as a player and included strong provisions to protect the farmer in various situations further if market forces resort to such behavior govt has tools and capabilities to further enact the laws to protect farmers interests but based on this apprehension alone is it fair to disallow the private players who could reduce inefficiencies in the system and portrayed successful co operative movements like amul and others plus we have examples where govt continues to exist as a player alongwith private entities airlines power oil telecom banks etc

best analysis on repealed farm laws
govt at least now could move on and focus on other sectors for economic growth probably a watered down version of this farm laws could be enacted in bjp ruled states or center might enact laws to strengthen and bring transparency to existing setup
the taliban their record exposed when they were in power from 1991 96 therefore the west let them consolidate but impose sanctions by blocking all food oil and other imports to the country meanwhile let the india pakistan and the neighboring countries be informed that taliban who are extremist sunny muslims will kill mercilessly the hindus buddhists and the other muslim sects like shia and oppose them in all fronts and isolate them financially

excuse me you need first confirm that is there any meeting or not after that when modi did not listen them in punjab when they block punjab they listen their demands so now they know if they block delhi modi has to take step we also know modi will not listen us only in one day he took some days thats why they are only delhi with some month food so they will return with their success govt welcome very nice of farmers with tear gas and pressure water then they need to broke the barrier listen modi is not good and he dont knowledge what right and bill

if u r not aware then do not make a video on it because u have zero practical knowledge beacause punjab and haryana is the highest producers of wheat and rice and they have a msp to to sell at no one bargains in the mandis because the msp is there in punjab and haryana one more thing this kind of law are already failed in some developed countries like france so first equipped yourself with the practical knowledge then make a video on any topic

like land bill was repealed but some amendments were done later and now land acquisition is happening just the way modi wanted but in another way i am sure he has something in mind regarding this also farm laws will be implemented but in a different way
particularly staple food culture is notoriously influenced by a purity
it is good step of farmers
i request everyone not to spread rumours these were for benefits of small farmers i studied in depth these laws for 2 days and came to this conclusion
its not a win please do not celebrate if you know modiji you will know it as well the game has just began do not cry later
good job u discovered it in easy language
shame on you khattar
govt is responsible for this farmers are fighting for the benefit indians except few rich

how hard is it to take back those laws about 100 farmers have died in the cold they have been sitting there in the cold for 2 months and for 4 months in total in punjab these kind of things are bound to happen if you keep ignoring a crowd of millions of people not all of them have the same ideology this was wrong but these people were allowed to enter the red fort and there are videos showing cops sitting there and watching them plant the flag on the fort and then the police started lathi charge obviously this was planned by none other that our country is plague bjp

nice lecture sir from this i predict that msp is not useful for small farmer so better it has to closed down or rationalized to small farmers only
msp is all about crops it is not includes milk and sugercane so shanta kumar committee calculation was related to only wheat and paddy so if we include other crops of msp regime it may go to 9 10 but not more than that
please make one more video on farm bill
biased people disguising as neutral one fuck the irony
what you have done and said today takes so much humility and courage though the laws were beneficial at least many south indian farmers believe so you have taken a huge step sir by repealing to rethink decisions made with so much hard work to undo what one does takes a different kind of substance
thook kar chatna boolte hain
government should tell the farmers that if their income doesnt increase in a timeframe therell be an option to go back to older ways politics should not stop experiments specially if farmer suicides has been an issue which dates back to congress days karz ka dher and karza maafi is not an option the farmers should be reassured and taken in confidence so that these politically motivated protesters get exposed
bjp will not loose anything but this is defeat of those farmers who were not getting msp benefits and also apmc market for their crops poor farmers will be poor no one will ever dare to do any improvement in farmers by laws

bro you should take this point also that how this anti farm laws is taken as anti sikh laws seeing that a large part of our army has sikh troops so repelling of these farm laws has some point of national interest also and how these farm law creating a rift between hindus vs sikhs creating new social divide in our country which can be used by our state enemy intelligence agencies it is just a opinion
being proud of famers for their courage and persistence
cifa advisor saab the msp is not in bill

the only solution is to repeal the three farm law

the committee members are not farmers they are economists scientists etc who support the tycoons entering the agriculture market with money and technology now the farmers are depending on fertiliser pesticides when modern technology comes agriculturists will have to depend for genetically modified seeds also they have to buy at price fixed by these companies modern machinaries will come which the small farmer cannot afford they have to sell their lands and become menial workers in the city losing their divinity and we consumers have to eat all dangerous grains which will affect our health thecpharma companies hospitals and stick market will be happy

i think you highlighted only the negative sides of the bill
in my city every wednesday the farmers directly sell their products at a comparatively lower price perhaps if the bill is successfully implemented there is a fair possibility that the uniformity in the price of the commodities will be hampered ofcourse the consumers will go for the lower prices and this will probably add to the fury of the middlemen if at all involved
sir please make a video on causes of unemployment in india
although i do not support aimim but the question he has raised is genuine one why media and people of our country do not understand that india is middle man between taliban and usa and they were in every meeting almost held in doha between taliban and usa you can check it in internet recently indian delegation met taliban in doha can we deny it
this is a pay for play bill president modi had to pass for his special interest which will give full power of food to 2 corporations that will eventually turn into a food mafia and charge ludacris prices for food the reason you dont see the biggest protest in world history being given air time on major tv networks is because the globalists that control it are aligned with the indian corporations that are trying to take full control over food in india for the global goal of full control over food for the one world order to control people

subsidies and new schemes must be launched for making agriculture scientific rather than depriving them of their right to property
not much social distancing or masking surely there was a massive rise in cases and deaths after this protest surely no interesting

if at all protesting farmers do not listen to the government take out tractors rally on 26 th january just to disturb national celebration day police should target the tyres of the tractors shoot them so that tractors will not be able to move see the result

a couple of hours ago pm modi announced that the farm laws will be scrapped so i took up an interest to study the topic you said that the middlemen from whom the government is desperately trying to protect the farmers from do not exploit the farmers and they are usually good people how can u speak on the behalf of all middlemen i mean you do not know all of them personally right secondly if they are lending money on a personal basis what difference does it make whom the middlemen are working for anyways they are lending the personal money right i am not criticizing what you said its just an observation thank you for the video

what happened was a clear case of communication gap and misunderstanding the protest was going on peacefully but then there came a third party that tried to fuel up the moment they tried to agitate the farmers due to which the attack started the police also reciprocated and the result was a total chaos what happened was very inhuman and disrespectful this could have been done with more patient and wisdom by both the sides very saddening
still i appreciate pm that this protest need to control as we have more external issues with communist china and pakistan
water cannons should be replaced by bullets if someone protest like this trying to run over policemen

farmers are fighting for every ordinary indian citizens the whole country should be supporting them

have you noticed any flaws in the reform laws in interest of farmers there are many new opportunities in laws for farmers without diminishing the previous facilities the compulsion of brokers are eliminating from agricultural products marketing which will free genuine farmers from the cut money of brokers many other provisions are in favour of farmers if we genuinely wants to help farmers we should support agricultural reform bills in interest of farmers not brokers and other interest groups
they are middlemen long live comrade modi what the left congress did not do bjp has done that the peasantry is now free and industrial capital is introduced in agricultural breaking the middlemen nexus with politician being a marxist i support bjp and pm modi

sir what about the mandi tax which a licensed trader has to pay in an apmc wont neo liberalism attract more private traders beacuse they wont have to pay this tax in an apmc thus catering towards the downfall of apmcs so now farmers will still have the msp but there chances of selling at a profit at apmc will reduce but before these ordinances they had a safety net of msp while also a chance of making good profits now because private traders will move out farmers cannot be certain of getting that msp i just had a this small doubt
so if farmers sell directly to traders how does it gonna exploit them cutting out mandis and middle man is profit farmers can get there true value of products and not the recession by mandis
the farmers from the other states already living under poverty line and they dont even know what is msp thats why they are not protesting
hahaha this is what you get for listening to autopune songs since islam bans music

why all western presidents blame the hong kong government regarding hongkong protesters

farmers have already filed case in supreme court challenging legality of these laws a good multi pronged action they should also ask their bjp mps and mlas whether they stand with farmers or against they should boycott all of those who are favouring the farm laws and denigrating the farmers movement they should protest in front of bjp offices in each of the districts asking the party to take a stand against the bills
government support always billionaires like vijay malya adani etc

election masterstroke
discussion between govt and the farmers is the only way vandalism is no way discuss and understanding of the bill and regarding msp already it is there so more amount of freedom has been given to the farmers against the middlemen who are actually looting the hard work of the farmers discussion and proper understanding between the farmers and the govt is the way out for better tomorrow for the farmers
central government should think about farmers kissan not about mukesh ambani or adani business class
press f to pay respect

owaisi is definitely right
4 farmers of state of punjab and haryana already benefitted from the supportive schemes of both units of federal structure resulting in augmenting their income more than double and uplifting their population and standards of living their of that not only enabled them to send their children abroad but also transform their ability from owing a land to running businesses and real estates
very nice dear kisaan i love you brother
govt took right decision by repealing farm laws indian deserves socialism not evil capitalism
shame on this magistrate for such behaviour haryana government has become shameless backing such action
this guy is always against modi he knows the exact reason for the withdrawal of the farm laws but it doesnt suit his commitment to the break india brigade
kaisa desh hai hamara everyone wants policies which only benefits them and never the society as a whole capitalism may have its demerits but at least it gives an equal chance to all idhar tho sab public paiseis ki piyasi hai god forbid any policy benefits others also this is our thinking

pm modi u embarassed ur own ppl by bending in front of goons to vote modi is our compulsion coz there is no other option but letting ur own ppl down is shame for modi sarkar
the same symbol is in sahib harmandir sahib and the rest of the gurudwaras to whom the vigilants of every religion hindus muslims christians buddhists jaini bow down by putting these symbols on the borders of the country soldiers not only protect the borders but also sacrifice their lives this nishan sahib is waved in foreign countries with foreign flags
problem is mistrust because the laws clearly skewed in favour of corporates adani n ambani let modi deny it
sdm ordering crush the heads of farmers how is this legal he should be put behind bars immediately

gumrah to ese news channel kar raha hai
one thing which people always have no insight is the the attitude of of the government for introducing these farm bills

we are farmers from gujrat we was doing better with the new laws these people did not understand the new law so we have to go back to old times silly people
the unity in diversity
good decision this shows that democracy still exists in india i really loved the shawl
who is responsible for the disgraceful condition of today is 74 year old independent india which denigrates two different graveyards two different dwellings and fellow human beings in the name of caste
so this is the reason for the protest
with so much fertile land and farmers neighbouring countries can be an market with marginal profits to encourage the local farming especially bangladesh and srilanka including pakistan china jai jawan jai kisan

so called farmers who are involved in agitation those states are getting msp benefits for last many years and in these states more than 70 of their produce is procured through msp as these farmers dont diversify their cropping pattern and creating havoc for natural resources depletion of ground water due to frequent irrigation bcoz of low electricity tariff and increase in water logging areas burning of paddy straw poor soil health excess use of fertilisers etc and unnecesarily presurrising central govt by taking the name of small farmers
they will come back after elections do not worry

surprisingly the headlines is about the traffic issues of one day for commuters what about the lost lives and deaths of farmers sitting for 10 months and protesting
statement 1 each rabi kharif crop season the govt of india announces the msp
if intension is to cut the clutter the video must start with the gazette notification of the 3 laws and your interpretation about its implications not by inculcating the idea in our minds that how all political parties has same openion
though speaking anecdotally for starters msp benefit could be denied to large farmers land holding x acres where x is based on empirical analysis now this changes tide in favour of marginal farmer because now either large farmers and middlemen will have to grow something else or use small farmer to sell his granary
infront of oawisi ct ravi is zero
and also msp will be there

also farmers in odisha are agitating for a while against bjd govt that the token system to sell produce to the mandi is flawed and how many farmers have not been able to sell sonepur and bargarh are the rice bowls in western odisha and they are unhappy others too but they are more visible that is also where bjp wins in odisha
this group is owned the ambanis they are spokesperson of bjp
all big fraud are befooling the poor farmers they are paid workers of ardthiyas and will be properly handl by these poor farmers in coming days skm is not taking real issue of farmers such as maximum large farmers 10 ha and medium farmers more than 2 ha are in rajasthan 43 large farmer and 28 medium farmer of the country these farmers live in w rajasthan and their income is than 2 acre of irrigated areas they never get benefit of loan waiver criteria is 5 kila or acre or 2 ha and ebc reservation how adani and amabni will harm these farmers as they dont have production kcc limit interest subvention crop insurance farmers definition power connection unemployment in rural youth stray animals etc so many issues are there tikait is saying kcc is bad you know his ignorance and foolishness

now anti india forces like pakistan have joined khalistan separatists and maoist groups supported by china are getting involved under so called farmers stir which is only from one state punjab and opposition politicians with the middlemen are paying the unions to stir the protest
who cares what foreign media says
farmers of this two states get the most out of it while the farmers of mh wb kn mp etc are left behind
this is more of trade of between security issues vs poor farmers financial security

modi is a politician at the end of day he thought of doing something in his capacity for the farmers and vast majority were happy with it but if a vocal minority of rich powerful vested interest group with strong pr is denting his image worldwide why would he care about farmers but when the silent majority actually realize what they lost it will be too late they missed a golden opportunity if they are so naive to comprehend who their friend is and who is their foe they are better off being left to their fate modi will find a way to win election but the

now the government is trying to mislead the supreme court in the name of corona and is also trying to make a narrative that in this tractor rally only a handful of tractors owners are agitating and not the other farmers not having tractors which is totally wrong as this government is trying to divide the farmers for which policy of divide and rule this government is known for this government wants to create the disturbances in the country to make such kinds of narrative i myself a very small farmer and till date nothing received from government it is not understandable as to by which right this government wants to pressurise the farmers who are always doing hardworking to survive their families and what right this government has got to intervene or to interfere in their private work which is not justified they have got any help from the government and rather the government is burdening them with high cost of fertiliser and petroleum and diesel prices and still continue to do hard work due to which this country has reached to the level of food surplus from food deficit in the initial years after independence this government should avoid using such type of tactics to divide them which will not be in the interest of the country and this government after all why this sort of attitude of arrogance towards the farmers and under which right when the farmers not wanting it

stupid to say in one word decently a reform recommended by various committees demanded at various times by these very same farm associations finding mention in political parties manifestos suddenly becomes contentious if farmers are worried about their mandis middlemen fading out what prevents them from contributing the taxes saved to them it is quite strange that humble service providers suddenly become life saviors family lenders where do they get all the monies when they are worried about their livelihood being lost due to these reform laws nothing of your blabber makes any sense what is very visible is your mad rage to oppose whatever the govt does considering this reform has potential to increase contribution of farming sector to gdp by two fold and that we have no other arsenal in our efforts to boost economy this significantly any opposition to this reform must be construed as criminal those who are fantasizing that this govt can be brought down by developing a perception of general disenchantment would even sell the country if it can fulfill their dreams while you have no compulsion to become a good citizen just reflect on yourself as to why are you doing this great harm to a poor country whose poor people are desperately looking for meeting their basic needs live a dignified life it should hurt your conscience if you have one

sg your analysis was spot on and has been vindicated today vide modi is declaration that the farm laws will be withdrawn
i really like your videos but if i may say this i would have liked more from this video the political angle the way the bills were bulldozed and how there were no prior consultations with the farmers perhaps adding why the fear of the farmers about the big corporations and contract farming are not unfounded should have been included maybe because these are short videos and these are complex topics you could not get into the details but i would have liked more points maybe about how the various states which did away with the act have fared etc this video really did help me in understanding what the laws theoretically aim at or are but i think it did gross injustice to the practical aspects and also it generalized things a little too much but otherwise i really like your videos

new farm bills are more vulnerable to monopoly atleast when you know that there is no limit on hoarding when there should be also like you said that the products are perishable in nature hoarding only helps them exploit the producers farmers even more for eg a product with msp of rs 100 for once is purchased at rs 120 resulting in maximum produce and sale let is say twice the actual demand the remaining produce can be hoarded and in the next season traders buyers can either refuse to buy newer products or ask them farmers to sell the same products at a half price because of their perishable nature farmers would not have other options but to agree also the potential players will be very limited and an open market saying is just a gimmick because in the beginning the products will be purchased at lucrative prices which have never been offered earlier at prices which cannot be paid by others even with taking huge losses on the account of buyers to kill a potential competition like it happened in the case of jio even idea and vodafone failed to survive which other buyer can take losses as much as adani in the agriculture sector anyone and then when the competition is dead there is no msp to protect farmer is interests mandis will close down eventually as they d largely remain non functional because of a better deal from the pvt buyers in the beginning like it happened with bsnl we already have seen such market disasters in the recent times do not we learn anything from it how can farmers survive an exploitative monopoly which even idea and vodafone could not survive apmcs are atleast in the interest of farmers new farm bills actually make the producers farmers most vulnerable in apmcs traders license is given to those who are close to state govts and the govts keep changing thus keeping the cycle running open markets with no law for msp unlimited hoarding and with giants like adani it is just delusional to expect a fair business taking place even in an open market this monopoly is worse by a 100 miles when compared to the conventional system of apmcs
cheap publicity to win up elections more than 600 farmers have lost their lives the parliamentaey process and procedure of passing bills into laws has been made a mockery of it is too late now what about the second wave covid dead any proposal to being them back does not matter go back you will back to where you came from both in 2022 as well as in 2024 once bitten twice shy the genetic design stays the same

where our democracy
response to this agitation has always been dismal all knew that this is a politically motivated fake agitation all knew that this was a threat to national security too but modi was informed about it not by the national security agencies that looked so incompetent but by amrindar singh is file modi let these guys go to the heart of the nation and insult the national flag because it was politically motivated the movement has not died down here protest is much more important than the welfare of farmers a brand is already formed it will be kept alive by other flimsy demands

jithne pesa ye government publicity me lgati h agr uska 1 bhi devlopment me lga de tho bhi normal conditions ho jati
i could see farmers having hesitant bevause of past politicans and laws but it is duty of intellectual class and media to be responsible i remember when indira gandhi had a bill to control population we had similar phobia being by the opposition and media that she is killing and had to rollback due to pressures now seeing the same misinformation and anger of other issues encouraged and misinformed farmers that reform will end they i cohld be agree these laws are not perfect but were surely not black or intented to harm farmers no political party in india has the intention to harm farmers not to mention some farm leaders are finding new excuses to protest if this cycle of protests continue remember bjp can also they did the same in bengal block roads and politcnans to affects administration i m surprised supreme court is quite in pathetic law and order situation
this all proves this is politically motivated chinese communist money or congress involved in all this
govt should clean these wastes and has to ensure no garbage piles once again in street in the name of protest
wonder why we are not allowing the farmers march it is their right to march as long as they do not destroy the property

everyone needs independent and peace to live with the family
unfortunately many farmers are not well educated enough so the wrong minded people mislead them for their own benefits even i was thinking that bjp has done something wrong because of which these people were protesting well i still do not understand their point what do they really need
they dont want make people believe through their channels used media
farmers producer organisation fpos of minimum 500 farmers to be formed central govt has target of 10000 fpos fpos to be formed by engaging 2 3 villages of same panchayat in rajasthan of nearby panchayat in haryana all farmers should have same shareholding and no licensed traders should be made member of fpos

common man point if these bills will be implemented then any registered company can buy and stock crop in unlimited quantity and store it till prices touch the sky so black market will emerge and wheat which is around rs 1800 per quintal will be more than this no control will be of government on it so common man have to pay high for food wheat rice vegitable fruits etc etc
govt should repeal these anti farmer laws immediately

another argument against the msp is that there will be no buyers at that price food is a basic necessity for which there will always be buyers the ultimate sale price always adjusts to the purchase price of an item
stand with kisaan
this man does not care about anyone but himself
thank you trevor for speaking up about this serious issue while indian paid media and news channel has completely failed lots of love and respect
can someone please translate their protest issue and their words in english thank you
according to my opinion as i have spent one year as a visiting professor at one university in haryana the main problem is the private trading at the wholesale market and the entry of the big corporations in agriculture which the farmers do not like as they are afraid about their future the wholesale market must be in the hands of the government fci should extend the minimum support price for all kinds of crops food and non food there should be new investment by the government to build new storage facilities more irrigation for the whole of india this is the european common market agricultural policy and it is successful india should not follow the american system the problem in india is that most economists want to follow the american system which is not a success they call the introduction of the american system as reform
who cares
we farmers from south india are extremely happy by the decision of the government
why is that government of india wants to bring in the new act through central government only why not act be pass through systematic assurances by every state government so that farmers have laws with their betterment that they have relied so far
i think modi just came to know little bit about farmers of up hariana and punjab

avoid all religions even the pope and christianity because religions are all led by the many blind guides and false prophets that jesus already warned us to beware of almost 2 000 years ago they all make up their own false laws and prayers when he alone in the name of immanuel is the son of man and the true prophet sent by god to be always our one teacher here follows a summary of his true teaching
agar food khana hai to ye to purchase karna hi hai aur govt revenue generate karaye gi

a well organised miniscule minority of the population can hold the government to ransom instead of showing such vested interests who is the boss political parties in government would rather surrender to them just to get votes a real shame

just people are commenting based on their ideology
delhi parliament itself needs reforming and modernisation  passing of the 3 farmers bills is testimony of failures in following the rule books of parliament a handful of people decided the fate of millions without debates and consultations a bill that is passed under controversial circumstances should not become law
the farmers protesting the farm bill are not only sikhs in punjab and haryana there are hindu farmers sikh farmers muslim farmers in punjab and haryana the farmers are not only from jatt caste or sikhs there are also pundits brahmins and dogar farmers in punjab farmers feed the nation big companies like tata birla reliance abany adnany these big companies are controlling modi these bills are designed to make each farmer compete against each other so that big companies can buy crops at lowest rate because farmers will have no option to sell to another buyer due to logistics and resources and the big companies have the logistics and they will buy at lowest cost from farmers and export to other countries this will cause food shortage in india because big companies will be able to export the crops to more profitable buyers in other countries and the food prices will get more expensive in india modi is working for the business tycoons and big companies the gst is hurting the small shops small factories and modi needs to be removed from his throne
msp is a racket to enrich farmers esp large ones in punjab haryana and western uttar pradesh because 60 of msp goes to support grains like rice and wheat the main products of the those 3 states that is why they are the only ones protesting most of the poor farmers of bihar and other regions of india who really need help do not even know what msp is because they have not been able to take advantage of it there are structural reasons for it and that is why you do not see them protesting against the bills reform in indian ag sector is needed because the policy has failed to elevate ag sector in a long time having said that i am surprised that modi shah failed to read politics of subsidy esp in agriculture may be they have become too over confident having successfully rammed through article 370 and caa legislations
those protesting will not have nothing to protest about they will have to search for a new agenda

the most disorganized program i ever saw both the anchors are continuously asking questions the farmers leader which is highly rude on the part of both anchors they are sitting on both sides of the farmers leader which is highly bad manners the poor farmers leader has to turn his face right and left to answer their questions to hell with this show zero decency on the behalf of both anchors bye

sir plz provide the pdf of this audio script
there is an apparent fallacy in what mr gupta is saying why is fci buying grains at msp only in or mainly in punjab and haryana since mp is also producing as much or more wheat as punjab why cannot fci turn its head towards mp for buying wheat at msp same with bihar where apmc has been abolished long back mr gupta argues that bihar farmer has no incentive for growing wheat since poor in bihar are getting wheat at rs 2 per kg which fci is procuring from states like punjab and haryana at rs 18 per kg i e at msp why cannot fci buy in bihar itself at msp i do not really understand why fci should buy from p h alone am i missing something
i think he lives in some parallel universe or people following him do

modi just misused the govt power
all government of course is against liberty
thank u so much sir
godbless all india farmers stand up together now please please
is pm condemn the death of kisan what a shame
the major concern is the silent farmers from other states who were in favour of these laws and against these so called farmers agitations in india the corrupt political and dishonest people are doing everything to destabilise the government but this is not the problem the real problem is the majority silent spectators who are unable to raise their voices against dishonesty the only maximum tool to show their concern is social media messages

if it remains a farmers issue it is fine but if it becomes khalistani issue then strict action should be taken against anyone who is sowing seeds of such hatred against india
1 hitler had not got married
ashraf ghani was asking for help but india refused to send wing commander abhinandan varthaman to afghanistan
this is so ironic

if supreme court does not take a serious action the way they killed the farmers in broad daylight in public the killer is are connected to the ruling party of india then the power of supreme court is purchased by modi government

it is indeed sad that the kisan is did not come for a discussion when govt called the opposition too ditched the nation for their own benefits it is so unfortunate that the decision to repeal the farmers bill was decided on road and not in parliament is this what you call a a democracy then why elections let is discuss on roads just imagine what will happen to this nation if everyone sits on road block each other progress this was totally unconstitutional and undemocratic
not sure why cover such irrelavant person like owisi for trp only he is only diverting the people from main issues like umemployement price hike

meanwhile proud to be an indian
how can they seat here since 1 year
there appears no use of discussion at the time of promulgation and no use at the time of repeal everything is decided by majority which is ensured after election results declaration and govt formation the whole process is thus democratic people are saying
shame to all for supporting ruckus public nuisance a true farmer can never afford to leave his field and play political games
lets all agree on one thing at the end its all power game to win it
but through modi is unilateral announcement without any consultation faced now a shame and further requirements may raised by these farmers again because no agreement have been made with farmers union prior this announcement
please do some selected topics for descriptive questions in tisspat hope you will do videos on that or else pls give top news that can expect in tisspat descriptive question

bjp ko gand means to bhut dur chodna bhi nhi aata
this fellow made kejriwal come into power not seem trust worthy old man keeps comming on in the times of election
for intellectuals policymakers refinement and promotion
the farmers who enjoyed received better prices for these 18 months for their produce will start now forcing the government to reintroduce the farm laws and an agitation will take place all over india now ground work has already been done properly and accordingly
the stand of sardar gurnam singh chaduni is commendable  that is the whole present political system including comrades too of our democratic secular country may be said responsible for harassing the kissans 
have been following your channel for some time now have to say that if there is an award for subtle underhanded propagandist it should be given to you your camouflage is effective but not altogether impenetrable
indian provinces should have more powers than the central government for india to stabilize politically
if it was to be repealed why then it was brought before what a shame
finally 3 laws applead
i think it would be better just to move the msp to only those crops that are in short supplies over time like shekhar ji has explained at the end especially to those crops that will save india from importing crops they can grow them self is another great explanation
that random person who liked my comments may you and your parents live more than 100 years

best lecture of study iq
all should work towards betterment of whole indian farmer
one thing everyone needs to understand is central govt proposes and implements laws at the national level they will see what is more beneficial at the national level when less than 5 across the nation are participating in these protests it thumpingly displays that the new farm laws benefit the nation better if it may cause any loss to that 5 they have to sit with govt and talk about alternative solutions for their possible loss not fight to repeal the new laws i hope this brings some sense to the protestors

also if the us would have made a phase wise withdrawal rather then just leftover and run away and could have make sure the legitimate government and military are able to manage on their own then it can save america from embarrassment and criticism around the world and make america feel sorry maybe or not regret a decision but certainly the us needs to acknowledge that a phased withdrawal might have saved kabul is abrupt collapse give the afghan government time to act independently and wage the war on terrorism then the us could also truly justify that this was a war on terrorism and that 3 trillion was invested in it and the lives of soldiers and dollars all the time were not just a waste of time money and resources

this law seems to have been framed by our proud one exam wonders upsc crammer and singed by illiterate obtuse intellectually dumb political hierarchy who likes to work like a proxy an absentee leader delegating his work to ias this faux of agriculture economy policy is bound to happen when laws are framed by crammers rather than experts who frames laws based on data of several indicators like human agriculture capital market availability and infra ecosystem
this is the most insightful and balance presentation on the implications of the bills instead of agreeing to include the exploitation preventive regulations you mentioned the bills were simply withdrawn the farmers are back to square one the farmers always bear the brunt in india and most parts of the world this has been historically been the case for most part of human civilisation

sir you are such a learned person and with a whole lot of experience under your belt you are one of those people who questions the government because you believe in an ideology based on years of learning through experience literature history and not for the sake of asking questions but i am very sorry to say that your analysis is so wrong at so many levels on this what you are rejoicing at sir is the victory of kisan netas of selective states who held the democracy hostage for approximately 1 year take a pause and think about this at times these protests became violent and now has overpowered the elected representatives of people of this country would you a staunch believer of democracy and constitution rejoice if our democracy succumbs to such protests sir you are a student of indian polity and know it very well that even if the current government was ethically incorrect and ramrodded the bill they still had the numbers to overpower any opposition by calling a joint parliamentary session if you say you believe in constitution then you shouldve denounced the whole act of kisaan netas here instead of rejoicing and now when govt who is equally responsible for this debacle has pulled the plug on these reforms we can all kiss goodbye to any agri reform for next 25 years at the least and so can the 80 poor farmers of this country who couldve become part of free market economics this is victory of kisaan netas and dont tell me that you didnt know that mr tikait was having his one eye on election all along

dirty politics of bjp they made passed the laws without discussing with the farmers they remained adamant when the farmers protested now after many farmers died they declare that they will repeal the laws i regret of voting for this party i swear i will never vote for this party
im against this law as it exploits the farmers the contract farming is something farmers feared as it give open permission to udyogpatis to exploit farmers and removing msp will bring our farmers below poverty line which could be disastrous and can lead to famines and depletion of economic liberalism and turning indian economy into capitalist economy whic can be pretty fatal for our country jai kisan kisan ekta zindabad

you have said nothing about how the free market reforms will help farmers why on earth will the free market care about farmers suicides the reforms have to be in the left direction more protection the current reforms are in the right direction which ironically is wrong you just showed some antique documents and old laws and quoted specific professors but not a single argument about why free market is better for farmers
a answer
where is the pm
very unfortunate i am very sad to see that central government repealed those revolutionary laws
he released his party will loose in up punjab uk later in haryana eventually in country
me reddy you asked a question why should we not trust government it is very naive question it is either asked due to foolishness or extreme bias but anyways here is the answer history looks at recent protest in last few years and you will realize that government has nowhere shown genuine interest to discuss the issue attitude is more like we have majority so we passed the bill you can keep protesting similar attitude here if government was discussing points in systematic manner like you laid out delhi ane ke jaroraat he nahin padte
i hope everyone understand the situation of the farmers and stop calling them anti nationals it is not good for the country and other neighbouring countries can take advantage of that
the farm bills will help farmers consumers
the centre has to examine and change laws to punish you we recommend

i just want all the people hating on them before and still and calling the farmers names and trying to force anger hate and communal division to at least back off do not even want them to apologise just stop doing that now because i still see hateful and provocative messages circulating on social media and apps
but govt assured that the apmc will always be there and msp will always be provided there apmc will never be shutdown its farmers choice to go outside and explore more options or to go to apmc just like bsnl is there along with other private telecom operators to regulate the telecom tariff my father is a farmer from karnataka he is very hardworking person we grow paddy here from 40 years what i am observing is only the middlemen and millers are benefitting from our crops after working so hard and investing so much on labour is and pesticides facing natural calamities labour problems water problems machinery problems new type diseases in the crops and all what we are earn is just to accommodate our basic needs of food cloths bike thats it forget our hardwork sometimes we will not get back our investment also present crop cutting done in this dec month is a complete loss for all paddy growers here yield reduced very drastically due to new virus in our crops just like covid on humans we not made any property from past 40 years we do not get any thought of making some property with that earnings just life goes on with hardworking forever so something to be done to benefit the farmers all these days only businessmans middlemens are having decent earnings and making properties everywhere small farmers fate remains same even after another 50years until unless if something is done now our country is developing means everyone of us should develop everyone be a part of it only few sector people are developing is not a whole development of the country these farm bills are not a big news here in south india or at least in our locality big protests and all happening there in north india i doubt does farmers really able to understand these farm bills properly mostly some opposition parties middlemens and others who are benefitting now are having knowledge to understand these bills and its impacts and to safeguard their earnings in future they are provoking farmers with false predictions to protest against those bills i trust our pm modi like our family head he never do anything harmful to the farmers or any other sector hardworking people he does not have intentions to earn something by supporting corporates bcz he not even have children is to earn for them treats all of us as his children is these farm bills are actually beneficial to the farmers and consumers except those middlemens initially there may be some loopholes bcz everything cannot set right on one go it will take some time to block all loopholes later definitely will have good future in the farm sector also
he cannot blame congress anymore farmers genuinely believe that their survival is threatened
if govt says that commission agents are driven by greed then what drives these large corporate houses are they driven by charitable intentions will they provide the farm products to end users on a cost to cost basis or will they also make profit why is the govt trying to portray the artiyas or commission agents as sole villans and large corporations as sort of some saints

whole truth making judgement over an issue is clearly irrelevant it is being said by nihang singh in the video that the person who has been murdered is culprit because he got cought tearing holy granth which is not tolerated at all by the nihangs for all sikhs holy scripture is worshipped and this incidents happened because of insulting and committed sin by tearing religious guru granth sahib ji eventually it is theirs obligation for hindus holy scripture is gitta similarly who are emotionally attached to their religion they cannot stop themselves to see such disrespecting one is religious scripture in the front of their eyes
ndtv only conduct detail discussion regarding this complicated farm bill
  5       10 ews           
i am now regrating to see this kind of news
every thing is simple
yes there were only some farmers that were objecting to these laws huge agriculture states were missing from these protests why some of the new law provisions are already there in most agro states so largely punjab that has fallen as number one agro state and political beings like takait and yogendra yadav were the protestors true also that elections are around the corner in these states hence timing wise it seems to be the reason but if this repeal is going to cost the farmers of these states to further go into downward spin then sadly the onus will have to be on them and also experts media and the govt who really did not explain the law properly to these farmers
keep your spirits high brother farmers the world is watching and victory soon for you guys love and prayers from malaysia tamilan urban farmer

close diplomatic relation that is all jai bharath do not trust west
never expected modi to do appeasement politics more than 800 million people are standing behind him as a rock he is still going round and round on his issues poor judgment by modi he should understand if we want to appriciate gandhian ideology or balancing act politics we would have goven vote to congress instead bjp

due to continuous cultivation of wheat and paddy the water guzzlers resulted in decline in fertility of soil some parts becoming saline leading to decrease in yield per acre and increase in use of fertilizer and pesticides and water table going down let these farmers talk to agricultural scientists in pubjab and icar of delhi the jokers like yogendra yadav and darshan pal are there to mislead backed up by seetharam yechury and rahul gandhi co

please speak on shanta kumar report which says procurement of grains should be stopped from punjab haryana western up etc and should be done only in eastern states secondly as per doha round of wto us canada eu etc are pushing india to restrict procurement and stocking to service pds i e 40 of population whereas food security act envisages stocks for 70 of population thirdly what happened in bihar after private procurement was introduced and public apmc were abolished and what happened to apple growers in himachal after corporate buyers monopolised procurement lastly pepsi has large contract farming for potato in punjab and issues and difficulties and corruption in procurement where in 10 years price has increased from 5 to 8 per kg but input costs have increased manifold during this time just giving political twist does not help farmers cause the public at large cannot be swayed only on political and emotional appeal the facts and issues and reasoning behind agitation has to be brought forward if people know details on what is at stakes and what farmer stand to lose by these 3 laws

good news farm laws are repealed by govt
now i realise why foreigners were able to rule over us you can find this kind of stupidity only in india and only till hindus are in majority
three simple conclusions that i draw from the govt repealing the farm law is that 1 mr modi has reiterated again that political pandits cannot predict his moves anybody saying i dont think modi will do this modi will do that shouldnt be surprised if he gives credits for this directly or indirectly to captain singh 2 modi has taken away one agenda from the oppositions kit just before a full fledged election campaigning is to begin for states election in 2022 and 3 modi should learn to consult those for whom you say you are brining laws
we well come you

dry runs to create civil intrest and communal flare up were successfully taken in non bjp ruled states like mh wb rajasthan arunachal kerala andhra etc raza academy was roped in by the enemy within living on the donations from soros and the likes of bill gate foundation and clinton foundation
but actually the fear of change in traditional subsidized farming is veiled behind this attack on the govt reforms
this decision may create some more protests
the roads are not cleared even after repealing the laws they will continue because terrorists have infiltrated the protests
and corona is over now opposition party silent on this drama

earlier i thought news laundry is a cool news link as they boasted how their channel is unbiased and all today its proven that newslaundry is not reliable and is definitely biased this channel is picking emotions and not the facts thanks such channels are only creating the problem and ruckus and definitely one must check the background of this media before relying on them blindly
i do not believe that it is possible the reason is that the celeberated corrupt enjoys great power half of the masses do not know that they are corrupt and address them as saabs fear them as they are influential
too no with
they are here b c they see a certain death with these laws and so they see no choice but to stay here in harsh conditions over 216 people have died while sitting in these dharnas

b to assemble peaceably and without arms
there should be hidden aspects of this decision the brain behind this andolan succeeded in convincing some people specially punjabis and jatts to react against these bills time will tell the results of this decision but one thing is heartbreaking that this is win of mobocracy over democracy
mam ur teaching method is very simple ap koi bhi topic bht detail s aur ache s padhati h
koi diye ka satya nahi tha bro you were mislead by the global tyrants in the name of science since you were not educated enough you thought what some people told as science is science it was an agenda to bring food scarcity and proliferate the use of pesticides herbicides etc which would eventually turn the farms lands and farmers dependent on some vested interests needless to say who they are not the usual indians as were blamed they were just vultures waiting to swoop down instead some hidden global giants who control 97 of the world and its policies anywhere were the real push behind this and many such science to unfold beware of science when its pushed by teeth and nail
farmers ofcourse very important
worst decission of bjp govt
it will not be good it seems first see your power and then tell
these are anarchists time for calling their bluff farm laws are just an alibi aim is to undermine the very nation
no matter what good bjp and our modiji do fraud parties congi bsp samajwadi party then owaisi will definitely find tiny negative and stretch it
misusing the identity of farmers
but you as all rulers stsnd unconvinced is obvious and rather sad yo interpret
dry fruits not a matter
they will succeed and send a message to world leaders everywhere dont mess with the people especially when they feed you modi needs to be voted out of power by his own hindu people to send a message to the world that nationalism is not welcome

well done shreya
punjab and haryana want the monoply to continue so they can keep getting the money whilst the rest of the farmers die
this is the power of emotional intelligence
there are 40 million afghans and each of them believes the durand line was established by a christian man to divide muslims enforcing the line is promoting christian war on islam one nation cannot go and choose its border that is what british india now pakistan did in islam this is haram unlawful but the pakistanis think it is halal lawful
bjp racchasi party
come on in kashmir and fuck all indian army
so these are pissful protest
cause of opposition downfall is due to such leaders raising silly slogans all the time
remember hindu gods usually have a weapon in their hand what he did was wrong surrendered and did not deny the guy who did it was mentally challenged and manipulated or simply crazy wanting death either way murder is done culprit caught and admitted it
these are the best bills of agriculture ministry as a farmer is free at his or her bill to produce sale his produce to whom soever wants and msp is assured by the govt of india to each every farmer
feel sorry for few guiliable idiots going to protest thinking they are protesting for a noble cause when all they are protesting is for ignorance backwardness stalling development and halting important reforms that will advance our nation

4 if all crops in the country are bought then what shall we do with the crops left in the country after consumption
excellent analysis sir thank you sir
the bjp representative was weak in her arguments she had no answers but also didnt want to accept the facts as they are so she swiftly manuvered towards blaming the congress this has become very convenient for bjp lately she hadnt answered one question raised by rajdeep also she was being opportunistic and looked for any factual mistakes made by the ancor to question his credentials to question her very opportunistic and arrogant to say the least i believe the bjp can have and do have better spokepersons and should take a stance on the subject at hand
modi ji s framer bill is a death to the poor farmers return gift to private companies for their genorous donation like demonization gst now farm bill all are too take away money from middle class and lower middle class and give to private companies relief of dues n wat now this govn is slowly replaceing public by private

and turne elsewhere to nepal bhutan sikkim etc
sorry for this why are you not show the monopoly of government government take incorrect decison against farmar in last week the leader of bjp murdered the farmers with car you can show this also
why farmers are protesting because their leaders are the middlemen in the money system and if government give the farmers to decide the price which they take for their crops then their leaders will lose their job and they will lose to manipulate people is mind
not explained about msp in detail private individuals plays important role govt failed to explained or assured to protesting farmers that they will not be exploited by private players who buy their crops in simple its like demonetisation got 100 mark in theory but failed in partical implementation
india need to openly support all anti canadian separatists moment many french speaking state in canada want separate country india need to give them support of all kind

real winners are america and china not the idiots celebrating these reforms being dropped
given the manner by which the union minister facilitated the evasion of arrest of the perpetrator of the murder by mowing to death of the innocent peaceful farmers proves his inability to be honest to serve the people fairly furthermore his speeches to mow down the protesters is also criminal instigation of the crime committed
full support to nihung singhs well done babaji
dont expect any professional respect from right wing
we are gonna die out of hunger once the farmers decide to stop working in the fields
karnataka protest lathicharge and golibar
respect farmer but i love my india shameful incident
it is not just a fear as you call it it is a fact and is seen in many states already and suffering is also obvious in farmers and big profits for the already rich unfair in my opinion there are problems as farmers agree but there needs to be a different approach not through dictatorship and ask farmers to just obey just because the government thinks it is good for them farmers are a human beings and have a mind of their own too believe it or not
they must have been whacked long a good
kisano ka nhi maan na hai sir sirf 2 3 states k powerful kisano ki wajah se ye wapas hua jo ki acha nhi hai its not a good decison for our farmer is as a whole

there is no use appealing to this fake govt they do not care at all this country have no any democracy or concern for the voice of its people any more it is been long taken over and now controlled by few wealthy business mafia who won elections propogating lies and fake social media attacks on the actual truth your lies will defeat you and more and more people are now taken it as a mission to defeat you fake bjp
sdm did absolutely right real farmers are on crop field those who gathered there were all political parties goons
if i take vaccine then i will not need to die ah
this is typical strategy of the commies and anarchists break the law provoke the police and when the police take action they blame the police and play the victim card have not heard of any protests in communist countries like china and north korea
it is only a politician stunt by govt due to up election
why does the government want the three farm bills to remain and also the minimum support price msp
in a letter to prime minister amarinder said the state has already written to ministry of agriculture recommending a minimum support
i must say thanks to your efforts and initiative
based on your analasys these 3 laws are not beneficial to farmers you suggest few guidelines to make farmers laws
same will happen for nep then govt must set up different committees in every state to communicate
actually this is a opposition is planned protest real farmers are working in their agriculture fields
the farmers of india sheding more tears than the tear gas can make
they ai not peaceful protestors and farmers they disrespected national flag and sovereignty of india this is politically motivated act of violence teach them a lesson
another problem is if all farmers start growing only one crop that has the highest msp then when will happen to fci because most mos the farmer is going single corp then water consumption is more
1 56 more rich than me
love you bade veer ji sir app bahut ache hai

i am not a bjp person or ever call anybody leberandu but gave many wrong facts like u cant go to court yes there will be sdm and dm like problem solvers but they ll same as we have in banks we call ombudsman but if u r not satisfied u can still go high court or supreme court then u did not mention that msp is still not a law next comes the fact that big markets like relience ll buy everything if they can give a farmer better price than middlemen or msp then its farmer is wish they ll sell or not its like u have job and somebody offer better job ll u take or not and there is always apmc if nobody buys your goods u can sell them in apmc its ur choice then comes hoarding of goods by big markets i know it is problem but is hoarding today not a thing but govt ll at least have authorities to look into like currently we have but still hoarding happening if we r arguing for this then atleast make a suggestion like better independent authority or something why protest and next comes kangna issue why listen to her do ur own fact check we should not listen any celebrity only listen to the facts then comes bihar issue people saying apmc abolition failed bihar agriculture search yourself and see if it realy failed all india agri growth is 3 6 while bihar agri growth 4 7 in 2005 06 to 14 15 which is just after reform and in 14 15 to current all india agri growth is 2 but in bihar its 7 so i dont understand how it failed according to u people make video with facts dont try to mislead people current indians are well educated

sc farmers are doing everything which is unacceptable but sc is saying that we will not evict them we will not follow our own judgement given in the shaheen bagh case you could block the road if the protest is spontaneous but you cannot cause inconvenience to the larger public by blocking roads for long time kudos to the judiciary tarnishing its own image under the light of its own judgement
were is the mask of your reporter
man of his words 
second the whole world watches and knows that delhi police has blocked roads not farmers although honourable the supreme court is in delhi still it does not know that who has blocked road then honourable the supreme court mistakes

congress and protesters we were successful in setting false narrative
delhi did not open borders they were cleared by farmer what rubbish
do not mess with sikh brothers 200 sikhs are enough to handle whole group of extremists
sit in sikh massacre is only in kanpur not in delhi if bjp actually cares about sikhs they should declassify and make public all the papers and files related to operation blue star operation woodrose and get ved marwahs report that he could not finish hold those police officers accountable but they will not because ander se bjp and congress bhai behan hai

land ceiling act should be observed and all these benamis should be punished for example why till date amitabh bachchan ji is not brought under the court of justice for holding more than 50 acres of agricultural land and there many more big sharks involved in this in a same way
very shameful act by farmer
a view held by many is that the laws are framed in a way that does not just attract private players into the market but supports and protects them as they gradually take over the agriculture sector easing the actual farmers and landowners out systematically
how unprofessional is it to leave your phone ringing continuously in between an interview
previously i think modi is not good person now i can surely says he is the great prime minister india ever had all khalistani people know the truth now they begin to fear ha ha ha great
every video is so informative not creating a biased opinion like dhruv tatti rabish kumar arnab guswami he gives very correct information good going nitish rajputji

very well explained thumbs up
bbc is statement that the 3 farm laws were detrimental to small farmers is a complete lie in fact it is the reverse these 3 farm laws were for improving the income by small farmers by allowing them to sell as a cooperative outside the regulated farmer market called apmc mandi in india however this would have made the large farmers and the middlemen in regulated farmer is markers lose their political clout and the latter were the ones protesting on streets especially in punjab and western up states of india

3 black laws taken back cause of upcoming up elections
this is not a farmer is protest but a khalistani separatist protest nothing to do with our nationalist sikh brothers and sisters which was earlier nicknamed as referendum 2020 almost every indian farmers are actively welcoming the new farm lays which will remove the evil middlemen who exploit the farmers and buyers for eg farmers are forced to sell potatoes to middlemen only for 2 per kilo while those same middlemen sell the potatoes to common citizens  30 per kilo shame on you al jazeera for supporting terrorists and anarchists
the clauses of the contract farming act seem to be written in a way to attract private players to the farming sector that may be fair from the governments point of view but to allay the fears of the farmers the farm laws can be tried in a few pilot states if the experiment succeeds in a few states then the model can be replicated to the rest of india

i see a lot of people in comments that centre has done wrong by repealing the laws i want to ask u where were u that time
q1 when contract farming is already in practice why introduce it through a bill let a state decide whether it is required or not
there is goes a democratic and peaceful means to make indian farming more efficient which means the environment is going to continue to suffer
poonamji now i do not think there is any avenue left to bring further in farm laws the laws are repelled parmanantly
hope conditions become better for all people living there
my school works
note read bjp on wikipedia democratic backsliding is in progress
it needs courage to accept his failure and modi is a courageous leader
if we listen to his all videos he speaks very diplomatically and supports non modi many times tries to brainwash people too for example in his recent video on security lapse of pm he also informed about crores of rs spent daily on pms security
sir will not there also be a reduction in deadweight loss if msp is withdrawn when they sell outside the apmcs

imagine that there is a bumper crop of potato and it is supply is way more then the demand would the buyers still want to pay the msp
those fuckers who never do faming is now writing in the comments about farming and that shit modi saying that only handful farmers protest i challenge him to prove that its handful of them
the government should think about farmers doubts and meet with the farmers
india is not free
thank you so much for making this video amazing job at summarizing the issues with farm bill
so shame on you delhi police so shame on you
their demands for recognition of msp as statutory right whittling down of the the commission for air quality management in national capital region and adjoining areas ordinance 2020 and withdrawal of cases on farmers seems unreasonable and naive for following reasons
media should not support accused and have to stand with farmers
everything is bogus remember the famous dialogue by pm joot bolo joot bolo bas joot bolo phir joot bolo

if government decided to bring msp guarantee law then india will have to borrow additional 3 to 4 lakh crore from imf world bank other countries and
govt leadership cannot go against the will of the farmers they are the essence of india and they have a right to oppose any agression
we are all know whom you are working for it is bjp
sikhs are so brave and strong and good minded people real indians
no discussion and consultation was made for the passing of farm laws there is also no discussion and consultation for the repeal of farm law is parliament becoming the toilet of bjp
a very good lesson mam really very beneficial and easily explained
thank u so much u helped me to understand my project topic
honourable supreme court of india should become custodian of the constitution of india not spokesperson of bharatiy janata party
1 this is a sign of downfall of punjus mainly due to drugs
hows the great reset going so far
there is not mature democracy in india
at the end
farmers never forget the hardships they put you through never ever vote for this gobar party
this is just like how usa created choas in libya iraq syria afghanistan iran yemen where ever usa goes it will destory peace same where ever hindus goes it will create communalism in every part of nation in world
shall we trust bjp govt headed by mr modi until and unless the bill be place in both houses of parliament is it modi government compensate the lost of the farmers for a year long agitations
great decision by farmers
the british and americans are not really entitled to an opinion on afghanistan anymore because you had twenty years and two trillion dollars to do something about it instead you handed over your own money to raytheon northrup and bae systems what you should all do now is crawl over to afghanistan on your knees and kiss the feet of the afghan people and beg their forgiveness for the biblical levels of suffering your wrought upon their heads for no other reason than to satisfy your master is greed
the government and the famers should have watched this video the farms laws were a progressive step leaving aside a few doubtful provision but the government made its own work difficult by name calling the farmers had it treated them with respect this issue would have been solved
i challenge anyone to make a satire on them
do not worry it will end up as playground equipment
guys if you know why opposition was protesting then you will understand the situation kindly check parliament whole video and also written statements of each of them on official website

the wire is the best
wrong explanation fact is now big corporates can buy directly from farmers and anyone with pan can be a trader so more options for farmers to sell problem is apmc can be completely skipped impacting their profit and corruption by middle men will be low
the whole question arises from your version of story that why the jeep was ramped up on to the protestors are you been running away from being questioned
well said rahul gandhi in fact pm should vacate his office more than 700 farmers died due to this farm laws  he must be held responsible
to all the illiterates our there
i dont know why common people not get this that this will eff them too
godimedia is finally reporting
protesters block the road indefinitely
it is because of news channels like you our country is not progressing selling a bogus agenda when the whole video is transparent and easy to comprehend there was a time that your channel use to show things of substance but look what you have come to simply not cool
are u willing to show first part of the accident why u fear
i do not understand the black hole in peoples minds when this is the reality
dictator modi will bring the laws and repel it without any discussion
british neocolonial powers are behind these destructive laws against farmers
thanks a lot for that kind words for punjab and punjabi and sikh religion
i am not a left or a right wing but this man is the best pm india has ever seen and a great conversationalist too

well done by farmers they know the laws better than any one relating to thier field
this is called chatukarita ka reporting
if the farmers do not want the new bills why give them lol corrupt shady indian government
people on this page praising the farmer is victory without realising the nuances of indian politics typically the idiots at the bbc would not miss out on an opportunity to critic pm modi fyi only the leftist and islamist eco system in india places the bbc on a peddle stool whereas the majority deem it a relic or outdated entity like the labour party
well explained brother
it is really sad to see the plight of those cops too as they have to listen to their authorities and get all the beatings
why has not the minister been sacked and arrested yet
modi wants bharat to be a hindu estate so let it be let khalistan come into being let kashmir come into being let asam come into being and let nagaland come into being what is left over is modi is hindu veresh enjoy what is the problem with that modi is a pakistani agent he has more sympathy with the late mother of nawaz sharif than those 140 farmers died because of the severe weather sitting in the andolan shame of this type of treatment farmers are andata they are not atanwad but modi has treated them as terrorist modi must be removed from the power and must be trialed to get a sentence of death or let bharat be divided into 5 parts that is the end of this rss terrorist hijacked bharat and created a situation of hatred and marginalization against the policies of nahro and ghandi this is the start of the movement of khalistan now it is out of control jai kisan jai jawan jai khalistan is what i have been hearing from the participents of this rally
prime minister narendra modi should be so shamed that he cannot even face his citizens farmers who elected him so shameless bjp government
you discussed half an hour about political implications of farm laws and not on its benefits and negative impacts
dont show wrong picture please
he needs to resign
never voting for congress party in my life jai bhaarat jai modi these congress traitors have held down our nation long enough with fake protests and scams allowing naxal maoist and communist movements to flourish
what binds india together is our multilateralism our diversity our shared love religion alone cannot be above humanity which modi uses tactically to divide the indians
pgurus has become such a garbage channel its become the mouth piece of subramaniam swamy and his chela abhijit iyer abhijit iyer comments on everything from diapers to thongs

priyanka gandhi must step forward if congress wants to win she is far better than rahul since she is a leader
singhu border four state people punjab haryana himachal and jammu kashmir are suffering 2 5 hour transportation etc is being done on shabby road neither govt nor kisan leaders are understanding common man problems if proper survey is done it will be revealed that millions of people have lost their livelihood
go get em lord no mercy on the wicked and dark hearths
i support the protest law se ab kuch nhi hoga sirf appeasement hi hota hai bharat mei
yahi ki tumhare agenda chal gaya these laws are need of india today we can not depend on this kind of agriculture practice anymore
one bill refers to procurements
please read the laws they are good for farmers in india
6 did they killed anyone police people on the streets to red fort
these farmers are good example of terrorism
bjp has completely failed our nation chaos everywhere
still this decision has more advantages and the disadvantages are mostly based on imaginations that it can happen or what if this happens for now it will be profitable for farmers
another flop show like last one
support modi and lock up the mob
have money will travel
question for bhkts now protesters are khalistani or kishan
it is nothing but propaganda some can mock me for saying this but why did only a part of india protested if it was truly not good for farmers would not have all the country protested against it now by revoking of the law the government has made it easy to every anti development section and communities of india to follow the route employed by the latter to achieve their agendas
and people might be thinking that these farmers represents the whole country so no way they only represents only their part of issues
hence repealment of the laws indicates modi ji has a bigger surprise
good presentation alex can you explain about indian agricultural commodity markets it is meant for hedging the risk and price discovery but the farmers participation is very less can you explain the reasons
i shamed to support bjp very bad situation our country is going through
captain is the one who started the farmer agitation and has won modi has no face now fir 2024
if we see sonu sood he has never met any such activities like jnu caa now farmer protest but when country need he was came whithout any special gesture
people wearing these masks can never be farmers why the indian government is not taking appropriate action against them
why is not inflation being controlled why is not the government being for the people of our country somebody is gain is definitely going to be somebody is loss in this case the government who is very selective on certain issues have to discuss it in parliament why was not it debated in parliament then what was the hurry for this ammendment there are so many other issues like the borders being protected they should have protected the borders like what they have done today not barricading not nailing and digging of roads fencing etc with our farmers
be united farmers without you there is no food center is not realising they are heartless
the farmers protest will help aap to win in the punjab elections
fucking bjp killing farmers killing muslims and after they will target christians and tribals
nice joke bus on road side godi media zamir bech deya hai keya vo vi dekho jo police k gunde pakade the kal protest m jo bus k mirror thord rahe the

750 meek poor farmers brutally killed by facist modi the way he massacred muslims in 2002 in gujarat i still remember the images of poor little children being dead in gujarat by modi
international media is showing farmers as victims but why do not they equally condemn their unruly behaviour as well
sir please attach pdf also
a family witch killed thiusands of sikhs is ruling in pun thanks to loyal pets

she had not analyse and think on what are actually farm bills about
he is intellect lier and stupid also
happy will be only congress and foreign funded left wing only thing worries is about poor uneducated farmers who works hard for there livelihood in practically its impossible but hope there is future settles
yeh haal modi k saath hoga if he doesnt take farm bill back china is training in ladakh and will free kashmir chinas next target will be destabilizing punjab and they will try to make khalistan if this kisan agitation keep going these farmer will enter modis home and parliament modi should take back farm laws and we all india should fight china
you should be sackedfor trying to play down the many who paid with their lives

although i was not in favour of imposing of income tax for farmers but i think now time has come that becoz of assured irrigation and msp paricularly in punjab haryana excluding southern haryana who owns more than 10 ha of land income tax slab of 10 on farm income should be imposed and collection of that income should be used for small farmers of these two states by giving special scheme of income generating activities

finally they got some donkeys who could carry people up and down the donkey owners would charge people for carrying them up and down for a fee and would also pay 10 to the society from the revenue they earned it was a very happy situation for all involved

the wheat farmers in punjab grow poison most of them the government for many years has been a garbage dump for them they sell to govt wheat for 30 and the govt further sells the crop for 2 3 the wheat crop is grown with large amounts of pesticides and fertilizers that no company can ever buy that stuff this is the main reason why these farmers started the protest in fear that if govt stops buying their crops then who will

long live farmers of our country
no one saying about bjp how they are criticising our farmers aur sab khate bhi kisan ka hee hai
you first look at your country where you are producing virus like jinping instead of producing food coz you are suffering from food crisis at least our country allows people to protest and freedom of speech and what you did during pandemic in your country especially in wuhan world notice that too india against propaganda india will unite
this moves if implemented will bring huge support from 20 35 yrs old job seekers and middle class and poor before up punjab uttarakhand elections
not explained sub sections of all bills about 70 sections are against producers and consumers
you poor ganoar rustic fellow
however only time will answer many open questions and it will be good to see who and how will fill this void and vaccum it is still doubtful to say what the us stake in the taliban takeover of afghanistan is but if we look at history whatever the reason a fact will remain unchanged that taliban will become a black dream curse for the world in particular for the united states of america and the west
farmers are right here
so my suggestion up to 5 years put tribunals with spl powers within 2 3 months

this is the real face of modi goverment they attack the poor farmers for helping the corporates
nice information sir i am farmar and need to know farmars problem
this withdrawal is done to primarily satisfy the supreme court and politically to install a govt led by sri amarinder singh in punjab but another aspect to the farm laws withdrawal is as under
democracy country prime minister is by the people for the people and not elected by himself because power of common man

tight slap on the face of rss bjp and godi media thats the power of indians who care about the country rather than religion
he is right just give one good alternative of modi and bjp will loose election
the government office where they weight the farmer is grain at that place u will find a notice like only 30 quintal will be permitted to sell this is a big blunder government must focus on this why government is not helping to farmers to sell full quatity
shameless modi india has never had such a shameless pm in history he is ruining india
what about the free market government can reduce the cartels but it cannot provide msp just under stand that
india is economy dropped from 2 9 t dollar to 2 4t dollar recently
well done as an anchor but does not has any idea of ground reality
very good and funny videos bring a great sense of entertainment
who is here after repealed these three laws
very well explained just one suggestion at the start when you mentioned that the govt provides msp for more than 20 crops you should have stated the exact number 23 looking forward for more
bjp need not worry about any negative electoral impact and in fact it is bound to gain very positively a lot electorally both in the long and short run but the crucial and some what the urgent need of the hour is that bjp should deploy its best communication and campaign skills in dispelling countering negating the poisonous extremely negative and a very wide inimical campaign started by the many rich farmers and very rich arthriyas middlemen in absolute collaboration with some political parties that are against the bjp against the new 3 farm laws in order to influence the poor and marginal farmers of jats and of india also
irritating
bro i just realised how delusioned i was i was with farmers in their protests but now i can see what really was the deal seems like too much fake news was there around this topic glad i found this platform to get unbiased news
nofarmernofood
why do not want to understand the msp means government purchase all crops msp is a guarantee like mrp

this open market policy is not new it is already there in many states even in my state of tamilnadu it is already there that is y my aiadmk government is not opposing the bill in many other states it is already there now it is becoming act that is all in punjab farmers currently farmers can only sell to mandis no open market policy there that is y they are protesring that means middle men are higher and state government is heavily dependent on mandi charges this shows that more than the farmers middle men are more affected that doesnt mean there were no issues for farmers yes there but like water shortage and some other issues i support the government wholeheartedly in this
frod report

news18 is reading bjp sources
in support of farmers protest please hear our latest song kisan lives matter
this is just a gimmick only taken with upcoming election in up and other states in mind modi can never be trusted if bjp wins in up they will take revenge on farmers for pushing them to repeal the law
please please all government help india kisan kisan problem lobour problem mothers problem girls problem women problem blinds problem ambedkar cast problem help help help
what is the use to implement laws and then taking back does it change anything
i am not fan any political party but before modi entrance all party were against each other but after modi i can see modi is one side and all political party is one side all political parties became friends of each other
people are protesting by walking they will have to buy new chappals
sorry to say but you have no knowledge about farmer bills have you ever visited a mandi have you ever been at an auction at a mandi its not about congress its about us farmers
rubika ji you are becoming baseless anchor you always target opposition and those persons who are disagree with govt media is to ask questions to govt if the agitation is going on the road govt is responsible if the people are suffering govt is responsible if any riots or violence occure govt is responsible all those are so as india is democratic country
you cannot just go and make up your own rules hurriedly the made up some man made pandemic rule

seems like modi and his useless government will not be back to power again
shameful hindustan gov
bro they buy rice from use for rs 14 per kg and sell for rs 100 per kg they gives us rs 14 because its msp which is in govt mandi now when private players wll come they wll give use rs 20 in starting for 1 2 seasons we wll sell them very happily and wll not sell to govt mandi for 1 2 seasons the govt mandi wll get closed as they r in very bad shape and govt also want them to close because they do not want to give msp to farmers when in 2 3 years govt mandi get close then private play wll buy our rice at rs9 or rs 10 because we cannot go to govt mandi they r closed monopoly bro then in 2 act of this bill they can store as much as they can they wll do holding and increasing of price and sell you the same rice in rs 150

like most punjabi hindus from a pind my family does farming and we vote bjp more so than congress lately grandfather time period and beyond used to be strong congress supporters no other choice my family is active at local level in panchayat and also at the protests political affiliation does not come before your livelihood and the wellbeing of your people the idea that only sikhs are going to the protests is all media propaganda sikh is 57 of punjab rest is hindu haryana is also mostly hindu and 5 sikh the protests are overwhelmingly hindu but media will only show sikhs wearing dastar to make rest of india buy into this otherism this is not a religious issue its a livelihood issue only people who are farmers and come from these families understand how it is going to impact us now and in the future whether they are hindu sikh muslim etc punjabi is or haryanvi is people in the city will not understand and they have proved it
if govt withdraws the farm laws what next what are takait goons plans for the improvement of farmers are the planning new storage facilities new markets new crops new connectivity new method of disbursing payment are they going to give up subsidies fertilizer electricty
sorry i am from australia so trying to understand most farms in india are very small between 5 and 10 acres are farmer afraid that they will lose the minimum support price there for they will eventually need to sell their land large companies start to buy farms on mass and effectively destroy farming communities but would i be wrong in saying that a solution might be to form co operatives in the local farming communities to create a stronger bargaining position
pta to chale vahan ke local kya sochte hai
this happen because of election
the repair cost should be recovered from the so called farmers
new international border has moved to delhi waste of public funds what a joke indian government has become
the another reason to repeal these farm laws may be protect our country from terrorism some mischievous elements were creating conspiracy with pakistani agents they may be make a blast like ludhiana court blast
afghanis were farmers until russia invaded them and the result are infront of whole world it is a wake up call for indians
do not they see covid
wth i just saw im f furious as shit are these farmers or dome goons they do not deserve to be treat like farmers but like some inhumans these congress and liberals have corroded all of our mind why it is not popularising because half of the nation is asleep and half is against bjp

the bills do not force the farmers to change track they only give more options you can choose an option or not is your choice the real problem of the protesting farmers is that they used to go buy the produce at much lower cost from bihar and sell it at msp as their own produce now the msp will be linked to land records so these farmers cannot cheat other farmers and will get their share of the msp benefits of course these farmers are protesting punjab has become a hub for drugs christian conversions and anti india activities these are being bred by foreign hands to destabilize india today the water table in punjab has sunk very low where you could often see atician wells they have disappeared to grow rice you need a certain amount of rainfall punjab is much below that greed of a few is killing them the protest is totally wrong sadly the money is coming from opposition foreign lands that want to destabilize india and psudo sikhs who want to form khalistan and are being used by islam against india anyone supporting them are knowing or unknowingly behaving in an anti national way
this is a big loss for india i think that 56 inch ka seena is sulking

just a question if something is not in favour of people then people can oppose it by protests and all yes there was violence here but the voice is heard here of farmers so is this a good thing that people is voice is heard
arthiyas can still continue to trade however state government may loose income so is a perception build that farmers will also loose money

this is sponsored agitation
in my view the govt should have included some of farmer is committee heads while formulating passing farm laws this would have avoided the protest repeal of law is not a good sign for the development
even if you know you are allowed to tell the truth to public
agar unko ye problem he ke media real issue nei show kr ra to ye puri such baat bhe nei he so stop playing victim card and rally me khalistani flags khulle aam udd rahe he to bakio ko itni se bhe samaj nei he ke ye chiz galat he ya ye chiz se galat message send ho ra he m not denying the fact m just keeping my questions and facts too just like farmers
farmers should withdraw their protest on 3 farm laws because as per pm these laws are good for farmers so let them try and live with these laws and if there is any problem after an year or so they can start fresh agitation pointing the real problem evidenced then the govt cannot turn a blind eye towards farmers
this will make bjp remain in power doing nothing

now come at the protests india is a country of 1 4bn 60 of its population work in agriculture do you really think some 5 10 thousands farmers from only 2 states represent the whole nation these protests were organised due to vested political interests people who sat on roads have nothing to gain from repealing of these laws though if they are real farmers then it is a loss of opportunity for them
nice info thanks
main thing is that farmers are not ready to hear at all so gov also should not introduce any reform for these fools there is clearly written in bill no land of farmers will be taken and if farmers do not agree with corporates to sell there produce then do not sell and anyway i think in open market without trade farmer can sell at a better price and its not that farmers are not getting msp they are getting more msp as compared to 2014 so i think we must support farm bills
those who are doing like this stop to eat food

still farmers are being misguided by these so called farmer leaders or lap dogs of middle men aka dhallals who want to make money without any effort by fooling the farmers by giving statements that corporate companies will take over your farmers land at the end farmers who have no knowledge of this bill will come out and protest but if any media ask the question like why you are protesting against this bill

the man representing the farmers made very valid points but didnt go out of his was to justify the mobs anger and actions rightly so he was also quick to point out that the violence had nothing to do with the farmers movement but an act of agression in response to agression he is a well read educated man

not sure why people thing farmers deserve more respect it is a profession like every other profession if one is not happy in ones profession please get out of it and do something else for the public who thinks this is a win they are quite wrong the farmers want the govt to keep buying their stuff even if it is substandard guess whose money the govt is using to buy that stuff that is right kids it is our tax money the idiot in the video has an agenda about his channel so he keeps on just opposing every single thing the govt does please look deeper into this matter this is a huge loss for all of us tax payers
and today the laws have been revoked
which is correct implimenting or repealing then why so trumpeting nothing done for benefit of agriculture in last seven years plight of farmers increased but income never increased sc might have exposed but everytime making it helpless

are yaar singham sirf movies me hota hai
i m really gonna be honest here this is something that has been on my mind but why does every time there is anything related to farmers or village people everyone starts acting like they are saints who do no wrong it is not like they sell their produce for free to feed us and every time some bad produce happens they get tax waivers and even the price of other things increases which is paid by tax payers here they are destroying buses beating police blocking highway which affects the normal people there we need to stop acting like villages are heaven or something cause in the end everyone wants to do things for their own good

if bbc do not know that these are politics by oppositions then better you should change your reporters even most of the common man in india knows that these are fraud dharnas unless you have a moto to defame india please do not support fake narratives who are paid
why msp is must for farmers can you explain
esy to understand
akali dal had done a first good job in the last 13 years
he sounds less irritating at 1 25 speed
some committee reports also said that fci procurement is a small of their total requirement thru apmc markets the msp is also being paid for a small of their procurement so main question are
first comment
farmers with their hard work helped in lifting poverty and malnutrition they have to be given justice and not treated in such inhuman way as some are seniors citizens who have still not retired from working
this people are kicked out of bengal farm lane now no place to sell there idols
respect ravish sir

we r with u we support kisan andolan love and support from london
you are ignoring the main reason of protest this is msp and permission of unlimited storage which will promote the black market
you cannot expect justice from a nation whose flags you burn down everyday

                rss                                                         
sir the best scenario is more govt mandies closer to the farmers guaranteed msp a guaranteed procurement of atleast the 23 farm produce which is already there on paper this not only is reassuring to the farmers but at the same it generates more employment opportunity due to more mandies the govt can use part of the produce to distribute to pds ration shops to meet the govt is social obligation which also the govt can use it as assured vote bank of the poor the balance of farm produce procured stored may be sold to pvt players at higher rates for them to add value sell at good profits this will be a win win for all stake holders

important topic hai sir thank you
he just wants to oppose modi
implementation of msp will cause food price inflation which will require doubling of minimum wages across india which means shutting down small medium businesses thus creating a feedback loop of destruction the new agriculture bill aims to correct that by shifting price burden on private sector thereby making it a sustainable long term arrangement benefitting both sides

people are saying that people especially farmers came in crores i say number is not more than 50k because ground capacity is only 30k also we can evidently observe that it is not a tight packed crowd all the dalals who are going to get hurt by these laws have gathered here but it will do anything as farmers from other states are very much opressed by previous apmc mandi and tht why no real kisan is against these farm laws we all have seen how some handful of jamindaars dalaals and land mafias have monopolised the whole system i personally experience this in delhi so be calm and support these laws

what about the pollution in delhi its because of the farmers supreme court has asked them not to burn it but they still do if a corporation owns the land government can fine the company which is not possible with individual farmers
there are so many anti india forces acting against the current regime they jump at every opportunity to malign the governments image policies need to be discussed in all regional languages so that farmers know that their interests are being taken care of and what they lose or gain in the bargain the conspirators need to be exposed but at the same time people have to be reassured
strongly believe they are paid
dont worry son we will get the justice
as per your commentary shekhar ji the govt reduces duty on oil being imported from a hostile malaysia as soon as domestic prices go up via market forces this discourages farmers from growing oil seeds and you expect the farmers to diversify into these crops and dals help the hostile malaysian farmer but screw your own patriotic farmers another lutyens delhi dictat like the paddy burning law

the three bills would free up the farmers to sell the produce directly in the market minimize the government power to regulate the stocks of essential commodities which includes various agricultural products and formalize contract farming these bills would cut the middlemen and improve farmers income but the opposition including congress which promised to introduce the same reforms are now opposing these bill andmisinformingthem for their petty politics

my opinion for the peasant farmers movement
am not sure how would i want to react to this what was initially thought of as something that was so very good for the farmers is now thought off as not important so was it that what the farmers and the opposition were objecting to was correct was tikait right all along if not then what the government did did it do due to pressing electoral needs if so then does the current government consider winning elections more important than something which they thought was good for the country did it compromise on its principles for the sake of winning elections arnav here you should be asking some very tough questions to the government never ever make it seem to the common masses that you are blatantly siding with the current government not good for the credibility of your channel as well as for you personally big fan of yours and the republic channel but this is my humble advice

modi government is anti farmers because before this policy farmers get the prize of maize 1600 per quintal but now due to this policy farmers are getting prize maize 500 rs per quintal now think farmers gave 400 rs to the labour and fuel consumption is 500 rs now calculate the numbers farmers expenses are 900 rs but they are getting 500 i m very unlucky because i born in india where the future of farmers is zero hope i born in other countries where the future of farmers is bright jai kisan
this congress and opposition creating chaos to fool the people for vote
hope these people understand the importance and ability of these farm laws theses are good and will boost their income in near future sometimes it is good to take bitter pill in life to eat a sweet fruit in future

have we to suppose even the intellectuals like shekhar gupta have come to the conclusion that immorality in politics is not a bad thing and a wicked party wining election after election through communal polarisation and hate mongering has to be meekly accepted as a normal thing without any attempt to protest against it in that case this country is undoubtedly going to the dogs

you claim farm laws are good for farmers i m a farmer and i do not find anything good in the law declaration of msp is of no use unless the buyers are forced into not buying below msp
the bills r for ambani and adani not for farmers
idiots of punjab

the farmers protesting the farm bill are not only sikhs in punjab and haryana there are hindu farmers sikh farmers muslim farmers in punjab and haryana the farmers are not only from from jatt caste or sikhs there are also pundits brahmins and dogar farmers in punjab farmers feed the nation big companies like tata birla reliance ebany adnany these big companies are controlling modi these bills are designed to make each farmer compete against each other so that big companies can buy crops at lowest rate because farmer will have no option to sell to another buyer due to lack of logistics and lack resources and the big companies have the logistics and they will buy at lowest cost from farmers and export to other countries this will cause food shortage in india because big companies will able to export the crops to more profitable buyers in other countries and the food prices will get more expensive in india modi is working for the business tycoons and big companies the gts is hurting the small shops small factories modi needs to be removed from his throne
if they realy care for farmers they can make changes in fram laws and cover loop holes so that farners will be benifited

moreover the farmers are demanding the same apmc system of pricing with the corporates too that is msp if this is done and a small about of tax similar to apmc tax is levied on them it would be better
haha farmers protests why didnt you interview the genuine farmers who raised riots on the 26th jan injured more than 600 police personnel disgraced the red fort the indian flag
in india law and order is on side of the majority it is infested with bribery fake encounters political affiliation with ruling parties discriminate against minorities with low trust with the public minorities sikhs at this point have a low trust value in police providing them any justice there have been multiple cases where indian police has attacked tortured sikhs recently in 2020 a video shows in mp how brutally the indian police is beating the sikh who is a granthi on account of not having a license police officer only got a temporary suspension
this farmers protest will bring down the modi government the government should stop showing favouritism to adani and ambani this will be bjp s waterloo mr modi is very much required to be in the center as we have two hostile neighbours china and pakistan only modi can stop them so please solve this farmers protests asap drop all the ego and find a solution with these so called farmers if they do not farm then there will be a shortage of food
only congress can save india
media does not have the guts to ask ambani adani whether thes farm laws are good or bad
10 000 is too many also that leaves women all by themselves which is dangerous esp if they arent allowed to get jobs or are discriminated for certain jobs

why agricultural experts and stake holders not involved to deliver good farm reform while keeping benefits of farmers in mind
but for farmers they are worried abt the truth of india ie corruption dishonesty frauds and loots thats going to follow
now the recent talks has made some changes in bills government has made it clear that msp will be provided in written the problem is with taking the knowledge till farmers and make them understand in 2019 many opposition and farmer groups protested to implement this act the best way to analyze this act is by implementing it for a year this should be studied as a case study after implementation but not on assumptions
farmers rally really
it is a big lie by the indian state propaganda the whole world know about the indian bjp government is barbaric atrocities occurring since past years
police and para military forces need to use heavy blockage and fencing facilities to stop these armoured tractors rally
thanks sir you let me understand very well about msp
the 3 farm laws which are going to be repealed were for regulated crops such as wheat rice sugar cane and pulses lentils gram etc a total of 22 products milk vegetables and meat products are already de regulated what is required is regulation of milk and dairy but the farmers in india have very low financial literacy and thus fall prey to political propaganda of the socialists

in the end these all politicians are big chor and murders
what is happening in chhattisgarh
reliance want to buy directly so that minimize the middle man it never giv farmers a solution instead giving option to reliance to buy from everywhere opportunitic business
i support the farmers there is a vital difference in the statement of bjp leaders their practical performance on the ground level they officers in their ruling states are unresponsive against offence followed by corruption despite written request with evidence hence they are liable to be rejected for ruling in future
we can see the difference how tamil nadu farmers peacefully protected in delhi for 3 months vs punjab business goons leading violently

state like bihar do not have mandi system they have private sector who never give them appropriate price of there crop bihar already have private sector for buying the crop from farmers from past 10 years than also bihar farmers are poorest in the country with 5000 monthly income where as state like haryana who have govt mandis farmer income is 14 000 per month so bringing private sector in agriculture is surely not a solution of this problem problem is to remove middle man or make a law for compulsury to followed by all the states and increase wearhouse system where govt can store good amount of food to sell other country india is on no 1 to sell food in international market than also indian farmers are poorest is the world

real news
1 farmers are allowed to sell outside of the apmc but who are these potential buyers from here comes the importantfact about the fpos on the ground you can see many of these fpos are formed by a small group of farmers as per the regulations which are not the same as you highlighted during the 2nd bill discussion as the farmers were creating artifical inflation as a result farmers can now participate as another stakeholder in the supply demand chain
real face of india

1 subsidy in seeds 2 subsidy in fertilizers pesticides 3 subsidy in electric 4 subsidy in diesel 5 loan waver after all these also still msp is required a proper analysis needs to be done to see actually without all these benefits how much a kg of rice or wheat will cost for me it seems it may go beyond few hundred rupees it is complete mismanagement and will not be sustainable in long run in a country where 60 of population are into farming and it is completely mismanaged then country will never progress this is the easiest way for pakistan and china to destabilize india and
today i realise that there are drawbacks in democracy and i realise that why china is developed

how to compensate adani he has constructed massive food godowns
very well explained sir i went through 3 to 4 videos by different channels but none of them could highlight the pros and cons almost every channel informed about the pros thank you for such unbiased info
what happened our india
whilst this critique looks at how free market could benefit the farmer and i do not think this was made clear enough simply assumed based on western economic theory the reality of different types farmers and farming practices as it stands for india was not considered the free market model has been in practice in the west for a long time but it had not made western farmer better off furthermore biodiversity has suffered as has the diversity and variety of foods that are grown there are much fewer farmers today than in the past and fewer and fewer people willing to continue farming there has been a huge loose of heritage crops and therefore foods and therefore culture the only winners of this model has been big corporations old or new model middle men are inevitable so better to have local middle men who you can engage with directly than corporate global one is who do not know you nore care about you nore have any channels to engage with you
modi breathes

congratulations farmers on your winning
dived and rule fail hojayega
are they farmers
indians of all faiths and walks of life needs to recognize that fact that their country has under occupation and they are detailing with a political system which was forced upon them by colonial powers to create channel for smooth follow of goods services and cheap qualified labor after the colonial powers had left the occupied lands the parliamentarian system was created by european political scientists in the favor of monarchy where multiple parties fight it out for the administration of the nation while the monarchs control these parties from the sidelines parliamentarian political system is not a true democratic system for the people by the people
no one should trust or recognize the taliban not also send any money or support until they are gone or have an inclusive government this government of terrorist suspects is a joke

in order to produce diverse crops why not fix a competitive msp for all crops like the crops that the govt imports now farmers will be incentivized to produce more oil seeds other crops by doing so you can ensure the production of diverse crops by guaranteeing the farmers a livelihood

some argue that there is no tax on farm income in india this argument does not stand a closer and fact based examination the minimum income tax limit in india is about rs 500 000 a huge majority of farmers will never touch this limit even if they are given their full msp so where is the benefit of this exemption and does that also exempt a farmer from the indirect taxes that he has to pay for every other item of farm input
good work farmers good new is chanal good work
sir your lecture was amazing
america cannot be compared because they have alternate employment if we do that and all farmers move to lucrative alternate jobs we will have to import our foodgrains from outside msp should be guaranteed for marginal farmers first as they donot have enough land to take care of family for 12 months msp guarantee would increase mrp we need to take it in account as well and ensure inflation does not rise on pretext of increased output cost also middlemens should be totally uprooted from system and profits should go directly in pockets of farmers msp guarantee should run in phases starting with mp up and bihar only punjab farmers are already rich then if it is successful should be moved to wb orissa and chattisgarh but priority should be small and marginal farmers

first of all please tell me what were those 3 laws that was introduced by govt of india nda none of you know if so then you do not know what to do with it untill you saw them protesting i have no proof that they were not farmers but do you have a proof that they were farmers if so then who was growing those fruits vegetables food grains and more if all in majority of them were at protest you guys know nothing neither those people who were protesting and rakesh tikkait seems to be a politician more than a farmer this is being done all because of money and money which is paid to them by parties and international groups and these media is have no work instead of spreading poison they have ruined the lives of people more than making it good both the oppostion and the government and involved in this mutually and it is alp there way to rule the country and making the people fool as i can see you all are getting too it is neither a win of farmers so called nor a defeat of the rulling party nda it is all politics
same kind of protest happened at the time of fda allowing in india but govt stood strong and passed the laws look where we are today these laws were for our good

print is nothing but andolanjeve as pm categorized them andolanjeve makes their living by doing protest they are nothing but organized pr to protest to pull crowd its an organized industry and these people are part of it they even cannot have a open debate on farm lawa

the reality of ruling party is to take tough decisions and still get elected to rule again nobody likes ruling party to take tough decisions because it changes the liberty to do things of many people in the society who would give vote in elections hence party who does good work take tough decisions for the nation never get voted to power again in india we are basically a dishonest nation to the core the dishonesty is seen everywhere we have rules procedures to do things are basically dishonest they ensure to protect the rule makers even when it encourages corruption in the country the people are waiting for a liquor bottle to sell their vote we want every thing free so we want someone else to pay for our expenses hence in this country the politicians also need themselves to get elected so what he will do save nation and get their opponents elected this type of wishful thinking is only of tv debaters and speakers

well explained the reform looks good in paper but opening up the market to private players does not guarantee and a smooth transaction the issues of apmc price management can also pop up when big private corps step in similarly the misuse in contract farming can also be suppressive to the farmers the farm laws arnt perfect however they could have been sent a parliamentary standing committee before being passed hastily without in depth expert inputs
listening to dk singh is anytime yes  dksingh says they did support farm laws in principle yes but at the same time shekar gupta was propagating about how the poor farmers are going to suffer just by making assumptions and painting sinister color to it
important question is who will establish private mandi just like congress n simillar partys taken oven gov mandis bjp also give liscen to there close persions and they will be new thekedar of this new mandis like ambani adani would be new private mandi owner this is also one question who will get benifite

could you please explain the reasons why farmers are protesting in another video
rice production first place wb
kisan pehle bhi free tha kahi bhi bechne ko toh mncs kyu nai ati thi kharidne aur konsi mnc bhai 80 unorganized sector vyaparies and chote retail msp is to protect baki mai farmer hu jo bhav dega bechunga msp saare crops or chayie
one argument against the msp is that it causes an imbalance in the cropping pattern because it incentivises the farmers into growing the crops that offer them good returns this argument is a classic case of putting the horse before the cart see it like this punjab is not a land suited for rice and yet this is happening because there is no msp on the crops that it can handle better if the government declares and enforces msp on every crop then punjab and haryana are more likely to shift to oilseeds and other cash crops infact declaring an msp is the only way of ensuring a balanced cropping pattern
his body language does not seem happy
how to make best youtube videos youtube channel add background music picture title icon etc please make video about this topic
pehle msp was there for 25 crops only even before these laws so will that change if these laws happen
its only punjab which is protesting why cause its all khalistan movement nd the middlemen who are making good money nd not paying taxes he wants punjab nd muslim votes votes

why police start rude behave first punjab kisans are not the spoons of gandhj ji they are the sons of guru gobind singh ji they know how to create the path
the huge chunk of the food grains grown in india goes to pds public distribution system and the central government purchases the same and distributes to the state governments for distributing it to the beneficiaries of public distribution system pds the big corporates and other big guns with lot of money and power at their hands have this ever prevailing ready market and purchase the food grains at 50 to 65 cost of the minimum support price msp from the areas where there are no apmc mandis apart from punjab haryana and western up and this very much procured food grains go to the central pool at minimum support price thus earning a profit of nearly 80 to 100 if all the food grains are bought judiciously at minimum support price then the corporates and so called middlemen will not be earning much profit this is one of the main reason that why corporates are desperate to have these three farm bills to make upto hundred percent profit and spending no amount on marketing a big question why government is favouring corporates and not farmers
midia is working as homly dog not as inert person you not obeying duty media will personally liable

at the end of the day india lost the opportunity to reform its agricultural sector
i think this is great for indian democracy i am not an expert on the farm laws but i leave it to the expert i am only examining the functioning of democracy in india imagine since bjp took over for every thing they pass an ordinance which means they do not want any discussion at all second the president is signing every thing and never on a single occasion questioned why the urgency for the ordinance and the way parliament sessions are conducted is even worse the speaker chairman does not bring any bill for discussion until last minute and then passing them through voice votes even the way finance budget was presented last year was horrible the fm does not give any details and asks to refer to the budget addendum for every thing that will be shared after the session and after the session it was all crap with no data definitely the current government does not want to take questions and accountability democracy is failing in india and if that continues we will end up the way like china

i am sure that in its next term the bjp will go the whole hog on agri reforms packaging it more subtly allowing more leeway for the states in the implementation
i m your big fan but you always come up with a reason for being late
nice explanation both side views covered
it has been observed that some persons have more than enough allergy to congress and they seem to be living in dreams when the issue is that of farmers they talk of congress as they are more than enough sticking to certain party may be beneficiaries of this partyhalf knowledge not knowing that state government has passed resolution to governor who is sitting on it
that future is not far get that message to the director and editors
do you think these people are educated they get manipulated by the opposition and start protesting and every other state is welcoming these laws except punjab because most of them are unemployed and has a personal grudge towards india
it gets bad blood with free things
1 sided reporting shame on you

the reason they want women between 15 and 50 is to breed the solution is simple the fewer the number of taliban the fewer districts they will control

i have dedicated few lines on farmers protest lives lost
respect humanity
it is amazing that when a large number of farmers protest for their rights against the bills that passed in the parliament denying their demand when remaining out in the open ground at a so cold climate how rest of the people sleep in own mahals in their cozy facilities not heeding their voice how much we are concerned for the peasants group who have spend their whole energy to produce food grains for us should not we give ear to them think thrice are they on wrong demand
how can you say that the laws passed in parliament without any discussion are so good
if farmers want to live decent life they should go for industry status

india should be prepared for anything 
3 the most important of the lot does not these farm laws in the long run will reduce the number of independent small farmers and bring them into the service sectors
for everyone who is arguing in the comment section just let me tell you this once true information always does not win more information wins even if it is fake the best way to overcome this is to always fact check your information no matter what it is and for that you can use a fact checking site but if you still think even fact checking sites have their own agenda all you can do and all you must do is to learn data navigation everyone must learn it in this day and age since their is so much misinformation out there right information is all that stand between you and the rest of the world
but blocking farmers using everything
these laws are taken back not beacause government care for farmers this is because upcoming elections in up punjab uttarakhand etc
the mandi agents under the currently passed laws will have to provide traceability of their transactions with the farmers as well as the retail end where they would off load their stock and that will be taxable no more driving bmws without paying taxes so whether it is mandi agents or corporates the govt will mop up taxes which was missing for 73 years

kids are celebrating reapealing of farm bills
new farm laws is a lifeline for big corporates who are keen to enter the only space where demand is always ever present food supply this feeling is compounded by the modi government is reluctance to make msp a law if these legal changes are going to help farmers get better prices in the open market then what is the problem in legally fixing floor prices every year after all if private procurers are going to pay more the government will never actually have to pay the msp and it will cost the exchequer nothing
tikait others do not go to farmers committing suicide in maharashtra is it because not getting any fund for going there is congress ruled state

adani agent modi will bring back adani farm law after elections continue protest until agent is defeat
this is hell what other examples we need to prove that we are living in hell
is it taliban government
when you do not want to acknowledge the truth instead just want people like rakesh tikait to validate your false notions of todays truth please spare us newslaundry
still now they not take any action what they are doing bloody cm
but why in the first place are the international prices low because the foreign governments compensate their own farmers by giving them a hefty subsidy and what else are the indian farmers asking give us a compensatory subsidy if the produce sells below the msp give us an assurance they want it to be a law not a verbal or written guarantee they as we commonly hear them have had a bad experience with the past promises and the meaning twisting tactics of the political class
first of all the main target of my experiences is that we have no need to be fool on this univers but sorry to say u about that we have to fight against manuvaadi strategy in short i have to tell you about that the real truth off my personal experience that all categories who prouds to be manuvaadi strategy on a limited number of people on this univers for example rss k pimp brahma vishnu mehes jai shree ram jai mata di extra extra thease type of tatey we have to need to distroy immediately
all are just trying to manipulate the current government scenario in the country and running for pm chair
all the best to u guys

during the start of the green revolution the punjab farmers participated and from then on large number of mandis got created in order to procure and store food grains so that our country does not go in hunger
u r not telling about the rules that have already broken by tha central government farmers are doing correctly otherwise all the indians should buy food by giving gold
if farmer cant afford farming they should do other work i dont give a damn about these who loot india they get everything free why
appeals are being made to sikh pride and guru govind singh to get farmers to participate in the protests

i would consider this news channel to be saying absolute truth with unbiased opinion and information but you forgot to mention the role of the private players as the hidden controllers of the government the ambanis and adanis
what is that dharam visaish this is how the cover up is done taliban mindset is being protected and promoted by government why

farmers want not minimum support price but farmers want minimum sale price
why media keeps on sustaining mr sitaram yechuri mr daniel raja by undeserved publicity do they represent the people how many elections have they won
great strategic move by bjp
the worst and partial media in the world
thats not how a real farmer would stack sugarcanes in a trolley clearly this is scripted those farmers did not even know the laws
the clauses of the contract farming act seem to be written in a way to attract private players to the farming sector that may be fair from the government is perspective they too need to be encouraged into participation but farmers have their own apprehensions so to allay the fears of the farmers the farm laws can be tried in a few pilot states if the experiment succeeds then the model can be replicated to the rest of india
mr goodi cannot come outside delhi till the election believe me

it is sad because haryana government had decided that they want 75 reservation for local people and they were going to pass that bill it is like saying that newyork corporation needs to hire 75 people only from newyork not from other parts of united states so modi had to withdraw farms bill it is not the first time state governments in india always try to implement this rule they do not want people from other states flocking into their state mainly targeted at up bihar which are most populous states in india so alot has been going on in background and it is not a win it is a total loss of india if you look in terms of country is prospective
this is all dirty plans of congress

so now india should close the afghanistan file
there is huge disconnect between farmers workers laborers and urban middle class elite section agri business of indian society people who are mostly discussing this issue including this well meaning young youtuber running finology have no clue about actual problems of farming in india the most dangerous thing is that bureaucracy and political class which actually makes laws and implement thru bureaucracy in india is totally obliviant when it comes to farming farming in india is very diverse and each region has its own issues that is why it was supposed to be state subject instead of central govt is concurrent list crux of most problems is that india is being run from delhi instead of giving more power to each state and in centralized decision making states are not represented equally with current dispensation we are slowly moving towards disintegration of india so enjoy living in bubble as longs as you can
1 now small farmers have option to sell right at their own doorsteps and not worry about logistics middlemen and commission taxes bribes all these leads to produce wastage and loss of important time cashflow etc alternatively they are free to sell through mandis

do you know that how much farmers are suffering due to not getting msp every job has hiked its salary in last 50 years but the farmers incomes remains same my father is a farmer i know how much it is important cut all subsidies but atleast give msp farmers are not even able to pay for the investment how do you think they will feed there children my father has to open up other business just to survive and give us good life even after having 200 acres of farm government can easily support it as they provide so much to other working class and it is economical feasible take example of brazil for sugarcane corn and wheat for north america i go though all of your stories and they are very much to the point but about this topic i am disappointed because you just took one side and showed the other you should have thrown more light after research dont give subsidies take tax but at least give msp so that people know which crop they should invest in and every acre of land if difference you may have 20 acres suitable for sugarcane but you may also have 2 acres in central not suitable for it agriculture has so many risks in it that with this structure it is not going to be too long when people just leave farming
you purposely didnt control the situation we also have videos of police taking selfie with the farmers at red fort and sitting on the side instead of stopping there was no violence until that point so what happened obviously it was preplanned the way barricades are installed at delhi borders i wish you had installed at the borders where china built a village inside india
they should march to the parliament and rid india of modi once and for all
indian army brutality tear gas and water canons against peaceful protest planned at delhi why is the government using extreme anti democratic tactics against their citizens citizens have a democrative voice to protest peacefully thete are no viloence crimes or law and order or security issues its all lies and propaganda disgusting and shameful tactics watch whole world this shaemful and evil government unfair and provocative actions by the security forces against the farmers of panjab the farmers will fight back if you account innocent peaceful democration protestors india fake democracy dictatorship shame on you trying to silence the poor masses you deployed these tactics in 1984 but today all the world is watching you cant censor the media

when govt agencies scientifically determine the msp they consider all the factors of each acre will produce so much crop crop quality will be average and these are the diesel cost fertilizer cost seed cost etc etc
the media will never cover the full story just the clash never the pains of the farmers old young men women every farmer is there who likes to be violently splashed with cold water in winters not me not these farmers these are poor people who just realised their power and right in unity may god help them fulfilling their noble purpose

farmers and labourers in jharkhand bihar are gentle and poor they have a traditional mindset of accepting whatever the lord saheb says which is different from the attitude of farmers in punjab and haryana they avoid confrontations talk to any of them and the difference between bihar and punjab farmers is very obvious during the lockdown mostly labourers from bihar and up were victims and they walked back thousands of kilometers to their villages without raising a single voice

this bill looks very promising eliminating corruption at middle men and farmers end users and private companies are direct benefitors
thus they are undoubtedly empowered and uplifted which caused shift of the focal from them to other states who are in dire need of support from both government and industries and that is what this act is envisaged to do
this is failure of government they should solve the issue however no body should be allowed to create problems for common man administration is not playing its part they are just spectators

the laws themselves have always been great in their spirit to usher in a great era for independence in farming economy the first thing that angered the farmers was the suddenness and swiftness with which the laws were enacted without prior engagement and sensitization of farmers to what was coming up nobody implements such far reaching laws with such brashness like what pheku did instead of mitigating that anger the pheku dominated media and govt machinery went into assault mode which further exacerbated the problem by compelling farmers to take postures which just kept getting worser and worser it was all phekus ego right from the start that he wouldnt listen and it was the other side that had to listen all his apologies and soft tone now is purely a facade and election gimmick why else would a pm who was trumpeting development hardly 1 day ago even using the iaf for his election by landing in a c 130 on his expressway also apologize because it was clear that nobody bought that empty progress nautanki this sadly is the only way to make the narcissist pheku listen  when it is election time

not happy with the govt outrightly repealing the law it should have been amended if flaws are there it may act as catalyst for other protests across country so what will be the govts action for other similar protests then we have to see highly disappointed with the govt repealing the law under pressure where the protestors have caused mayhem and ruckus in and around delhi i do not know why there were no protests around other places in country except delhi and ncr are not farmers everywhere in country or govt is bending it is ways for those who can afford to protest in and around delhi and not caring for other place farmers
victory of anarchy over democracy street veto has defeated reforms welcome the the phase of mob rule all countries will catch this trend and no law will be passed in the parliament a handful of goons with strong global pr machinery who manage to block a major highway can easily armtwist a democratically elected govt into submission shame and disgrace

modi has raised his stature by repealing the laws and being honest as to why has to do so the unholy combination of various vested interests proved too strong in terms of financial resources to finance protests these interests are basically anti national and should be destroyed in due course till such time punjab will be siphoning off incomes from other states and destroy their own environment
but i hv a query why farmers who are protesting are not ready to set a panel and talk to govt directly

muslims should be careful and should vote unitedly and with their brains for example a constituency where muslims are 20 30 or even 40 the possibility of a muslim candidate getting elected is very high but what happens congress fields a muslim candidate sp fields a muslim candidate bsp fields a muslim candidate rld fields a muslim candidate mim fields a muslim candidate while bjp fields a hindu candidate so the muslim votes gets divided so bjp wins with hindu candidate in a muslim area very easily maybe the secular parties are deliberately doing this to help bjp and weaken muslims politically therefore muslims should focus on one single party only voting for mim owaisi is a good option for a change where where muslims are 20 30 or even 40 a b quadri india
7 all corrupt subsidies are converted into direct bank transfers production linked incentives and liquidity control via kisan credit cards and cash credit accounts

the one lousy state election which iyer mitra refers to are actually two in punjab there is a need to support amarinder to eliminate congress in one more state and gain an ally in both houses of parliament in u p there is a need to strengthen adityanath in the long term interest of the country because u p is critical for 2024 and adityanath may be a strong choice when modi retires at age 75 as it seems likely other than that there is the khalistan agitation supported by pakistan and possibly china that is raising it is ugly head none of these threats leave alone the bankrupt opposition with no constructive propositions to offer existed at the time of manmohan singh so with all due respect i propose that iyer mita should hold his horses and think a little more before using his considerable standing as a journalist to express opinions that may harm in the long run
so how can government win the trust of the farmers
nobody paid attention but modi spoke of zero budget farming i think he is going to gift a desi cow to small farmers and encourage zero budget organic farming
