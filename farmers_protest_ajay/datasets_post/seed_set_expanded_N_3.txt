So hey, I was having a chat with dad wrt opposition claim on MSP. Has the price of MSP been specified in the 3 acts, with a rider of course that it will be reviewed every year by a select committee or some such body, not ONLY by bureaucrats? Apparently, just to say that MSP remains is not enough. To say that it is being restored to its original intent of being minimum support price and not, what it has become, maximum sale price will not do. Do throw some light on that.
Rally me sab itne khush kyu hai 
Koi galat arth nahi nikala! Tum BJP wale ho hi aise! Insensitive and arrogant!
He will talk only against bjp ..
People have no idea what has happened. Kisans think they won, but in reality they have given govt big opportunity. See how govt will use in upcoming elections.
If Government does not listen to farmers and do violent lathi charge against farmers, this will be outcome. What kind of Government is this  ? Which hurt its own people.
Fake farmer leader have nothing to do with farmer welfares, he is behave like he is a maulana shouting "allha o akhbar". 
This government is disgusting!
I think farmer deserve the best treatment... Not like this treatment.... I think next time all the farmers should bring all the cattles with them cuz no citizen are determined to support.. supporting farmer is supporting urself.
Farmers - MSP can't by guaranteed. Guaranteeing MSP means the money goes from taxpayers or Corporates pockets without any quality evaluation. A MSP range per year can be proposed based on estimated demand by Govt. (Govt.and Corporate can use data analytics and set MSP range based on historical and projected demands and make the process transparent and visible) but Kisan cannot go to court when MSP is not within the range. And no guarantee. Nobody knows accurate regional demand in advance.
I don't support these farmer laws...it will totally help the elites to takeover land of the farmers...and there is a clause that if any dispute happens between the company and farmer then the case will be gone the court and if you are not aware of this but judges can be corrupt...for this there would be stay order or the company may bribe the judges to give the favourable judgement for the company owner and the farmer may loose his land...
Farmers have already filed case in Supreme Court challenging legality of these laws.  A good multi pronged action.  They should also ask their BJP MPs and MLAs whether they stand with farmers or against.  They should boycott all of those who are favouring the farm laws and denigrating the farmers movement.  They should protest in front of BJP offices in each of the districts asking the party to take a stand against the bills
Outsiders like Americans will be laughing and joking that police are beating on the people because of their hands in the corporate takeover., hopefully the farmers get their rights before it gets out of hand.
What a memorable fight ! India would remember this for a long long time....
The people who attacked others cars and beat them are not farmers , they are hooligans and they belong to just one place which is prison..
Ye car chdane walo ke liye terrorist word use kro please
So what are the Indian farmers asking? Give us a compensatory subsidy if the produce sells below the MSP. Give us an assurance. They want it to be a law - NOT a verbal or written guarantee. They, as we commonly hear them, have had a bad experience with the past promises and the meaning-twisting.
Corona,What Corona
Shame on your media . 
Modi sipping garam chai watching this from bed
Follow my official channel
Fake news expert NDTV....
hate godi media...hate republic channel
Me reddy you asked a question - "why should we not trust government" - it is very naive question. It is either asked due to foolishness or extreme bias. But anyways here is the answer - history. Looks at recent protest in last few years - and you will realize that government has nowhere shown genuine interest to discuss the issue. Attitude is more like we have majority so we passed the bill. You can keep protesting. Similar attitude here - if government was discussing points in systematic manner ( like you laid out ).. Delhi ane ke jaroraat he nahin padte
Old flag and old national atham he best ha da watan
Fresh Anti-CAA protest will begin again..
The government should debate with farmers on this bill before turning it in a act
Sir do u know what is ur rahul priyanka manmohan problem is u ppl are well enough educated. Education is real problem of my country coz u educated problem cant do anything and some chaiwala is disteoying my country inside out
Dear dhruv, i really like your anaylsis. Can you please also create video for the people impacting due the rail roko in punjab in cold wheather of december.
N not all India is protesting ??
The government needs to win trust of all citizens regardless of their religion.
I request everyone not to spread rumours these were for benefits of small farmers I studied in depth these laws for 2 days and came to this conclusion. 
As soon as the taliban forms government the India will tie up with their government 
India should progress aggressively in all spheres.
Government shouldve stayed with the decision but eventually it has to look after the national interest. 
It's revealing one of the world's powerful mafia. A cunning mafia using the poor farmers as cover.
h)  Each farmer will have it's agrivalue based on quantity of land utilised and can be availed any time with help of banking system integrated with apex body and it's farming community. 
Ndtv Congress ka channel ..... rubbish Kumar ki channel ...gadhe logki channel.....bakwas .......
Breaking rules and protesting is bad.
12. On Feb 2021, Supreme court of india created an farmers expert committe of experts to listen to greviances but farmers unions
Not a big deal if there are changes in finance and decision people always protest. India need to change, cannot remain in old laws
 Modi did it to gain vote from farmers in UP, coalition with Singh in Punjab, definitely Mod and BJPi will Enter the PM office for Next General Election....Know the Logic Behind  any decision
Mr tikeit the need of the hour is cheep labour. Then we can manufacture things for low price. Then we can sell it in world market. Then we get dollars. If we have money we can progress our country. With out money we cannot make infrastructure. Think in both ways tikeit. Government is not getting money from the sky.
Why this people r not wearing MASKS.......
I can hear khalistan jindabad in the end
ACOORDING TO INTELIGENCE REPORTS ISI IS PLANNING  LARGE SCALE  violence THROUGH  FARMERS.  So MODI IS SMARTLY HANDLING  IT 
its very sus to see ONLY Punjabi  in this protest.  As they are the wealthiest farmers and mandi lords in India.  
Bravo Modi. You did a great thing but the vampire middlemen and the hypocritical hate-filled opposition leaders out for blood did a great wrong. I wonder when the small farmer will start a protest, but they don't have the resources to do that.
Nakali gandhis stop your drama, you to do not a word singhur murder and Jaspur killing. Why this partiality? Why are you misleading the farmers? Munde baimuch.
There are many more farmers in India then  these protesters who support to the law
So to break these protest and in interest to internal security ...modi had to withdraw or taken back decesion of farm laws bill.
The roads are not cleared ,even after repealing the laws.they will continue,because terrorists  have infiltrated the protests
Goal post has shifted, US dollars in plenty to be paid to rich Kissans.
Those are not farmers you idiots, they are middleman who are making profits out of farmers, Modi wants to cut these middlemen out so that the Farmers get all the profits. You leftist Quint, help the farmers not the middleman!
They are not farmers, terrorist
Mahapanchayat of dalals, not of farmers. Farmers are being hoodwinked by these people, led by Tikait named dacoit.
These are not farmers they are miscreants . What they did on 26 January was extreme example of that
Farmers should feel ashamed after doing this kind of act
One thing everyone needs to understand is Central Govt proposes and implements laws at the national level. They'll see what is more beneficial at the national level. When less than 5% across the nation are participating in these protests, it thumpingly displays that the new farm laws benefit the nation better. If it may cause any loss to that 5%, they've to sit with Govt and talk about alternative solutions for their possible loss, not fight to repeal the new laws. I hope this brings some sense to the protestors.
Nobody force for contract farming.
You have missed many important points in this video or did not wanted to cover like now farmers can not go to the court even after if any company refuse to pay them a single rupee and now  hording became legal for companies which earlier used to be a crime. We can already see the effect of these laws on ground now that Adani is buying apples in Himachal at the price of rs15 per kg and selling it in rs200 per kg in super stores across the country.
Its time for educated ppl to come in to farming. Just like australians did and finally agro industry boomed. Cus till goons are their leaders and uneducated farmers are just being played this will never change
Their meaningless protest had already done a great loss to nation. Now opposition and anti-national funded NGOs will look other way to harm India.
Abbba Vadra gives credit to his wife for centre s withdrawal of farm laws wah re wah fraud family
India has fake democracy
I subscribed your channel.... 
Why these pretenders are coming to up nothing but to escalate the issue. They want to pour oil in the burning fire.
So far they have been doing peaceful protests but these morons don't care so farmers had to take next step of blocking highways
This news is good news for farmers because long journey end... 
India needs Farmers NOT Politicians
Dalal  would tell the rates to farmers and farmers will have to sell as per Dalal rate
Tikayath is correct.
Where ever open market has been formed , the ones who are willing to provide better services have gained  more profits .
He is only doing this to get votes. After the votes he'll do a u turn
But it has stupid political and burocratic system.
Violence is not a democratic right and Yogee knows how to manage these bastered
People like Rahul Gandhi,  Yogendra yadav and other so called kissan leaders have to be taken to task and held responsible for the violence.  Also Rajnath Singh ji should be made the home minister again. Sad that these protesters hoisted a different flag on the ramparts of Red fort on a republic day. Strong action is required. I would like to add that the protests should have not been allowed in the first place.  Will the court too take responsibility!! This has been done just to demean the Modi government .
People are dying every hour 
Yeh haal modi k saath hoga if he doesnt take farm bill back, china is training in Ladakh and will free Kashmir, chinas next target will be destabilizing Punjab and they will try to make Khalistan. If this Kisan agitation keep going, these farmer will enter Modis home and parliament. Modi should take back farm laws and we all india should fight China

Rakesh tikat is big headache for BJP
This law seems to  have been framed by our proud 'one exam wonders (UPSC crammer)' and singed by illiterate, obtuse, intellectually dumb Political Hierarchy who likes to work like a proxy (an absentee leader delegating his work to IAS),   this faux of agriculture economy policy is bound to happen when laws are framed by crammers rather than experts who frames laws based on Data of several indicators like Human Agriculture Capital,  Market  Availability and Infra Ecosystem .
Thank you farmers for all your sacrifices. May God bless you'll.
Farmers will have to ensure this government does not start covert plan B against them
I support farmers.but this is a suicide mission
1 & only simple reason for this decision is 2022 up electionbloody stupid govt

25 minutes he kept questioning his behaviour .....not discussing the real issues of anti farmer bills. Pathetic anchor...
The people who commits crime or who cheats people are allowed to wander, espace  but the people who protest peacefully for their right with valid reasons are targeted all time...everybody should think and thank the farmers before they eat...
I will not vote modi again after this lmaoo

Defeat of real farmers....
If these bills are so much beneficial to farmers, why BJP is not talking with farmers & explaining them their fraud theories, *BIG SHAME on Swarajya channel* , Abb yeh desh kam Bhartiya janta private company ltd jyada lagta hai.
