So hey, I was having a chat with dad wrt opposition claim on MSP. Has the price of MSP been specified in the 3 acts, with a rider of course that it will be reviewed every year by a select committee or some such body, not ONLY by bureaucrats? Apparently, just to say that MSP remains is not enough. To say that it is being restored to its original intent of being minimum support price and not, what it has become, maximum sale price will not do. Do throw some light on that.
Rally me sab itne khush kyu hai 
Why these pretenders are coming to up nothing but to escalate the issue. They want to pour oil in the burning fire.
If Government does not listen to farmers and do violent lathi charge against farmers, this will be outcome. What kind of Government is this  ? Which hurt its own people.
I think farmer deserve the best treatment... Not like this treatment.... I think next time all the farmers should bring all the cattles with them cuz no citizen are determined to support.. supporting farmer is supporting urself.
Dalal  would tell the rates to farmers and farmers will have to sell as per Dalal rate
Farmers - MSP can't by guaranteed. Guaranteeing MSP means the money goes from taxpayers or Corporates pockets without any quality evaluation. A MSP range per year can be proposed based on estimated demand by Govt. (Govt.and Corporate can use data analytics and set MSP range based on historical and projected demands and make the process transparent and visible) but Kisan cannot go to court when MSP is not within the range. And no guarantee. Nobody knows accurate regional demand in advance.
2. If Punjab State government does not like the bill, they may chose not to implement in their state.
I don't support these farmer laws...it will totally help the elites to takeover land of the farmers...and there is a clause that if any dispute happens between the company and farmer then the case will be gone the court and if you are not aware of this but judges can be corrupt...for this there would be stay order or the company may bribe the judges to give the favourable judgement for the company owner and the farmer may loose his land...
Farmers have already filed case in Supreme Court challenging legality of these laws.  A good multi pronged action.  They should also ask their BJP MPs and MLAs whether they stand with farmers or against.  They should boycott all of those who are favouring the farm laws and denigrating the farmers movement.  They should protest in front of BJP offices in each of the districts asking the party to take a stand against the bills
Ye car chdane walo ke liye terrorist word use kro please
These are anti social elements not farmers... funded by congress party and communists , pakistan and china... real poor farmers are happy with farm laws
Corona,What Corona
Modi sipping garam chai watching this from bed
Give her address of you colic journalist who died and other 4 BJP supporters too..there family not weeping..they are celebrating..such shame..
Yeh haal modi k saath hoga if he doesnt take farm bill back, china is training in Ladakh and will free Kashmir, chinas next target will be destabilizing Punjab and they will try to make Khalistan. If this Kisan agitation keep going, these farmer will enter Modis home and parliament. Modi should take back farm laws and we all india should fight China
Me reddy you asked a question - "why should we not trust government" - it is very naive question. It is either asked due to foolishness or extreme bias. But anyways here is the answer - history. Looks at recent protest in last few years - and you will realize that government has nowhere shown genuine interest to discuss the issue. Attitude is more like we have majority so we passed the bill. You can keep protesting. Similar attitude here - if government was discussing points in systematic manner ( like you laid out ).. Delhi ane ke jaroraat he nahin padte
Old flag and old national atham he best ha da watan
Fresh Anti-CAA protest will begin again..
The government should debate with farmers on this bill before turning it in a act
N not all India is protesting ??
The government needs to win trust of all citizens regardless of their religion.
As soon as the taliban forms government the India will tie up with their government 
Chunav aa rhe h  vericate hat rhe h
This law seems to  have been framed by our proud 'one exam wonders (UPSC crammer)' and singed by illiterate, obtuse, intellectually dumb Political Hierarchy who likes to work like a proxy (an absentee leader delegating his work to IAS),   this faux of agriculture economy policy is bound to happen when laws are framed by crammers rather than experts who frames laws based on Data of several indicators like Human Agriculture Capital,  Market  Availability and Infra Ecosystem .
The best leader
I support farmers.but this is a suicide mission
Government shouldve stayed with the decision but eventually it has to look after the national interest. 
It's revealing one of the world's powerful mafia. A cunning mafia using the poor farmers as cover.
Modi backed down because the British Government told him to at the Cop26 summit sadly its the British that do all the positives for India and the negatives are supplied by themselves even to this day good luck farmers
Why this people r not wearing MASKS.......
ACOORDING TO INTELIGENCE REPORTS ISI IS PLANNING  LARGE SCALE  violence THROUGH  FARMERS.  So MODI IS SMARTLY HANDLING  IT 
its very sus to see ONLY Punjabi  in this protest.  As they are the wealthiest farmers and mandi lords in India.  
Bravo Modi. You did a great thing but the vampire middlemen and the hypocritical hate-filled opposition leaders out for blood did a great wrong. I wonder when the small farmer will start a protest, but they don't have the resources to do that.
Nakali gandhis stop your drama, you to do not a word singhur murder and Jaspur killing. Why this partiality? Why are you misleading the farmers? Munde baimuch.
There are many more farmers in India then  these protesters who support to the law
So to break these protest and in interest to internal security ...modi had to withdraw or taken back decesion of farm laws bill.
The roads are not cleared ,even after repealing the laws.they will continue,because terrorists  have infiltrated the protests
Goal post has shifted, US dollars in plenty to be paid to rich Kissans.
Those are not farmers you idiots, they are middleman who are making profits out of farmers, Modi wants to cut these middlemen out so that the Farmers get all the profits. You leftist Quint, help the farmers not the middleman!
Nobody is complaining about air pollution. All these fuel guzzling tractors.
Who said they are farmers
AJIT ask the farmers who are celebrating as though they won a lottery in Nigeria -what have they won? For your information its NOTHING! The farm laws were in the interest of the farmer!
Abbba Vadra gives credit to his wife for centre s withdrawal of farm laws wah re wah fraud family
Their meaningless protest had already done a great loss to nation. Now opposition and anti-national funded NGOs will look other way to harm India.
Its time for educated ppl to come in to farming. Just like australians did and finally agro industry boomed. Cus till goons are their leaders and uneducated farmers are just being played this will never change
You have missed many important points in this video or did not wanted to cover like now farmers can not go to the court even after if any company refuse to pay them a single rupee and now  hording became legal for companies which earlier used to be a crime. We can already see the effect of these laws on ground now that Adani is buying apples in Himachal at the price of rs15 per kg and selling it in rs200 per kg in super stores across the country.
Nobody force for contract farming.
One thing everyone needs to understand is Central Govt proposes and implements laws at the national level. They'll see what is more beneficial at the national level. When less than 5% across the nation are participating in these protests, it thumpingly displays that the new farm laws benefit the nation better. If it may cause any loss to that 5%, they've to sit with Govt and talk about alternative solutions for their possible loss, not fight to repeal the new laws. I hope this brings some sense to the protestors.
Farmers should feel ashamed after doing this kind of act
These are not farmers they are miscreants . What they did on 26 January was extreme example of that
Mahapanchayat of dalals, not of farmers. Farmers are being hoodwinked by these people, led by Tikait named dacoit.
They are not farmers, terrorist
we want farm bill to be implemented
modi government is doing right we need farm laws
these are not farmers these are terrorist
why are they protesting they are wrong
they are rioting they are talibani
why they are not following covid protocols they should wear a mask
msp cannot be implemented this is the fact
these are not farmers but bloody middlemen
it is not victory of farmers but victory of middlemen
rakesh tikait is bloody businessman

India has fake democracy
Koi galat arth nahi nikala! Tum BJP wale ho hi aise! Insensitive and arrogant!
He will talk only against bjp ..
These khalistanis must be sent to a islamic country..... Then they will know what a Demon country feels like.
People have no idea what has happened. Kisans think they won, but in reality they have given govt big opportunity. See how govt will use in upcoming elections.
People sitting on roads for their rights are also indians they are not VIPs shame on indian government.stubborn and disgusting
Kya MSP Wheat and Rice par honi chaiye?
India needs Farmers NOT Politicians
This government is disgusting!
Tikayath is correct.
He is only doing this to get votes. After the votes he'll do a u turn
Lolthis must be the Indian version of Fox News.
Violence is not a democratic right and Yogee knows how to manage these bastered
What a memorable fight ! India would remember this for a long long time....
So what are the Indian farmers asking? Give us a compensatory subsidy if the produce sells below the MSP. Give us an assurance. They want it to be a law - NOT a verbal or written guarantee. They, as we commonly hear them, have had a bad experience with the past promises and the meaning-twisting.
Shame on your media . 
People like Rahul Gandhi,  Yogendra yadav and other so called kissan leaders have to be taken to task and held responsible for the violence.  Also Rajnath Singh ji should be made the home minister again. Sad that these protesters hoisted a different flag on the ramparts of Red fort on a republic day. Strong action is required. I would like to add that the protests should have not been allowed in the first place.  Will the court too take responsibility!! This has been done just to demean the Modi government .
Indian government must be shameful.  Extremist govt cannot give peace and rights to the citizens of India
Govt wrong
People are dying every hour

He so true please ,how much knowledge he has so sympanthy about farmers ,He is true Indian diamond unlike other fake politicians who use government money to feel there own pockets
I request everyone not to spread rumours these were for benefits of small farmers I studied in depth these laws for 2 days and came to this conclusion. 
India should progress aggressively in all spheres.
Thank you farmers for all your sacrifices. May God bless you'll.
Farmers will have to ensure this government does not start covert plan B against them
Elections every month will keep evil mind at bay....  chest must have reduced to 56 micrometers after relenting to the demands of khalistanis....

12. On Feb 2021, Supreme court of india created an farmers expert committe of experts to listen to greviances but farmers unions
Are Indian farmars fromed by people on low social class?
Not a big deal if there are changes in finance and decision people always protest. India need to change, cannot remain in old laws
 Modi did it to gain vote from farmers in UP, coalition with Singh in Punjab, definitely Mod and BJPi will Enter the PM office for Next General Election....Know the Logic Behind  any decision
After long time.people have did lot of sacrifice and some also died.its too late for the citizens of this country

Kudos to those who are still supporting BJP.
the problem of BJP govt.in indian politics is an unfortunate one,the laders are uneducated and think themselves higher than anyone else!common people suffer!
MODI should be declared a clown
Why the left leader not included. They were the vital figures to unify the different farmers groups . The Kisan Sabha
Great framer protest
YES! THIS MARKS THE 72nd  REPUBLIC DAY OF OUR COUNTRY INDIA. GOVERNMENT BE ASHAMED.
Can you trust this man with white beard?  He has sold India down the river eg railway etc,  he looted public of 500 rupees , did not bring back  ill gotten monies (black money) and the list goes on.
Modi harrassment to agriculturist to make them free from land.
Long live Indians farmer...! Jai Bharat
It s victory of unity & great efforts of Punjabi farmers. They didn't get support from other parts of states n farmers so, the credit goes to only these farmers. My solute...
Farmers are right here
Modi is fool PM  of India
Remember when the British people had guts like this and fought for their liberty like these brave people.  GOD BLESS THEM
What the fuck people of this country are in power. They say this is a democratic nation. People have no Wright to protest calmly?Farmers protest was started from Punjab,82% of sikhs sacrified there lives for the freedom of this country but there is no respect.farmers are demanding there wrights why this stupid and incompetent government is not listening.is this a democratic country?modi has become a dictator  today.
Jai Kissan Jai Jawan. The government are not going to use Covid (which is serious failure) as an excuse to brush away their demands. Stand on sarkars neck keep going do not back down an inch
 I am also the son of a farmer, so this pain is our own, if the farmer is not happy then it will be difficult to feed the whole world, first he committed many suicides, some debts were buried, he appealed to the state government  Oppose the decisions and understand the pain of their farmers and speak for their rights.  The media should also emphasize this.  Most of the farmers make a living by cultivating on a small plot of land, do not deprive them of their rights and oppose the decision of the government and so I request everyone that this uf
The correct solution would have been amendments in the law.
Shame on modi and rss
Democracy on Sale....Sad..really...God save us
I will not vote modi again after this lmaoo
The people who commits crime or who cheats people are allowed to wander, espace  but the people who protest peacefully for their right with valid reasons are targeted all time...everybody should think and thank the farmers before they eat...
25 minutes he kept questioning his behaviour .....not discussing the real issues of anti farmer bills. Pathetic anchor...
              This too will become a jumla, farmers will be upset again, see.
Next cm akhilesh bhaiya

They can't understand that laws are good for them..

This news is good news for farmers because long journey end... 
Fake farmer leader have nothing to do with farmer welfares, he is behave like he is a maulana shouting "allha o akhbar". 
Innocent Sikh protestors being lied to and misled by the Indian government and beaten.. the Indian media r the worst media in the world

Its good they have repealed three laws itne lakh crore.. utne lakh crore is complete bullshit.. msp to mila hi nahi
But it has stupid political and burocratic system.
Can anyone explain me how a farmer with very little land below 5 acers can sell his product to private player and if the private player is not accepting to take the farmers product then where can his products stored to prevent damage or spoil of his products?

Very good video Amit sir, thank you very much for explain farmer protest
Brilliant video
Outsiders like Americans will be laughing and joking that police are beating on the people because of their hands in the corporate takeover., hopefully the farmers get their rights before it gets out of hand.
The people who attacked others cars and beat them are not farmers , they are hooligans and they belong to just one place which is prison..
Taliban can only show their Power against poor people like Afghanistan, they don't have guts to fight with some great country millatry like usa, uk, india
They are the Indian Taliban.
Defeat of real farmers....
If these bills are so much beneficial to farmers, why BJP is not talking with farmers & explaining them their fraud theories, *BIG SHAME on Swarajya channel* , Abb yeh desh kam Bhartiya janta private company ltd jyada lagta hai.

Mr tikeit the need of the hour is cheep labour. Then we can manufacture things for low price. Then we can sell it in world market. Then we get dollars. If we have money we can progress our country. With out money we cannot make infrastructure. Think in both ways tikeit. Government is not getting money from the sky.
Service sector gets canteen facility, medical facility, minimum wage, minimum pension, but is there any minimum guarantee to the farmers?
In theory, which has been the case uptil now, produce shud be purchased at MSP. But could you please tell me an industry where the govt sets up a floor price that private players have to pay.?
Please  continue the stir my dear Punjabi brothers. I would like to contribute towards my Punjabi Farmers. Please provide me details as to where I can send some money.

Looking at developments in recent years in India I fear our country is going in the same direction as Pakistan took in 80s.
First time on Media coverage maximum dislike. Lanat ho tara par Rabia
 80% farmers own only less than 2 hectres /5 acre land.
You would not live to see another had this govt try to follow Talibans. In my opinion you should get the same treatment what Talibans give to other religious minorities.

Karnataka Protest - lathicharge and golibar.
Only shree Arvind kejriwal can brings revolution of education in india.
Violence cant be justified. I condemned police too when they did lathicharge in the starting of January and I will condemn this act of terrorism as well. Use your brain, we Indians cant justify violence, aise toh kl kuch log protest krne lgenge ki 370 wapis laaoo. This is wrong!
These details should be covered in mainstream media but sadly enough it is not so
I am jealous with you, you achieved lot of love
Hence repealment of the laws indicates Modi ji has a bigger surprise.....
I have one question: why don't the government just shift the MSP from surplus crops to other crops that they want to incentivize.

Nishan Sahib is a flag which we can always see around Gurdwaras.
When he used the words "Breaking the chains of slavery" he was referring to the withdrawal of foreign military troops from Afghanistan. Because he has always maintained that Afghanistan should be governed by Afghan people themselves, therefore, the US must end its military occupation and all foreign military forces must withdraw from Afghanistan. That would be the only way to end this years-long conflict.
What is slavery? Your constitution is the constitution of the United Kingdom. Your official language is English.
Tens of thousands of years of mental decay and we have descended to this level of absurdity. 
Wat might bjp thinking 
Very very congratulations ji 
how do you agitate? if the courts do not discuss the issue, the govt is adamant on its stand; self-immolation is the only recourse then?
