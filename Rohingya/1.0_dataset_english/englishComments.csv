Peter Padling,"To be a Muslim or not means nothing, tribalism is one thing to look into. They can speak the same language but they themselves know the ties they not only have among themselves but with those from other Arab countries. It is not something where we come out and speak about in public because it's a tribal issue, something which only tribal leaders can discuss. Western culture and civilization will not solve this problem not even guns and bullets. The media will have no part in this.

Emon Rahman,"The Rohingya people are a stateless Indo-Aryan-speaking people who reside in Rakhine State, Myanmar. In 1989, the junta officially changed the name of Burma to Myanmar. In the 1990s, the junta changed the name of the province of Arakan to Rakhine State, which showed a bias towards the Rakhine community, even though the Rohingya formed a substantial part of the population. The name of the region was historically known as Arakan for centuries. The Rohingya population is concentrated in the historical region of Arakan, an old coastal country of Southeast Asia. It is not clear who the original settlers of Arakan were. Burmese nationalist claims that the Rakhine inhabited Arakan since 3000 BCE are not supported by any archaeological evidence. By the 4th century, Arakan became one of the earliest Indianized kingdoms in Southeast Asia. The first Arakanese state flourished in Dhanyawadi. Power then shifted to the city of Waithali. Sanskrit inscriptions in the region indicate that the founders of the first Arakanese states were Indian. Arakan was ruled by the Chandra dynasty. Following the Konbaung Dynasty's conquest of Arakan in 1785, as many as 35,000 people of the Rakhine State fled to the neighbouring Chittagong region of British Bengal in 1799 to escape persecution by the Bamar & to seek protection under the British Raj. The Bamar executed thousands of men & deported a considerable portion of people from Rakhine population to central Burma, leaving Arakan a scarcely populated area by the time the British occupied it. According to an article on the ""Burma Empire"" published by the British Francis Buchanan-Hamilton in 1799, ""the Mohammedans, who have long settled in Arakan"", ""call themselves Rooinga, or natives of Arakan"". However, according to Derek Tokin, Hamilton no longer used the term to refer to the Muslims in Arakan in his later publications. The numbers & the extent of post-independence immigration from Bangladesh are subject to controversy & debate. In a 1955 study published by Stanford University, the authors Virginia Thompson & Richard Adloff write, ""The post-war (World War II) illegal immigration of Chittagonians into that area was on a vast scale, & in the Maungdaw & Buthidaung areas they replaced the Arakanese."" The authors further argue that the term Rohingya, in the form of Rwangya, first appeared to distinguish settled population from newcomers: ""The newcomers were called Mujahids (crusaders), in contrast to the Rwangya or settled Chittagonian population."" According to the International Crisis Group (ICG), these immigrants were actually the Rohingyas who were displaced by World War II & began to return to Arakan after the independence of Burma but were rendered as illegal immigrants, while many were not allowed to return. ICG adds that there were ""some 17,000"" refugees from the Bangladesh liberation war who ""subsequently returned home"". A separate administrative zone for the Rohingya-majority northern areas of Arakan existed between 1961 & 1964. Known as the Mayu Frontier District, the zone was set up by Prime Minister U Nu after the 1960 Burmese general election, on the advice of his health minister Sultan Mahmud. The zone was administered directly from Rangoon by the national government. After the Burmese military coup in 1962, the zone was administered by the Burmese army. It was transferred to the Ministry of Home Affairs in 1964 by the Union Revolutionary Council. The socialist military government inducted the zone into Arakan State in 1974. Racism towards people with links to the Indian subcontinent increased after the 1962 Burmese coup. The socialist military government nationalized all property, including many enterprises of the white collar Burmese Indian community. Between 1962 & 1964, 320,000 Burmese Indians were forced to leave the country. As a result of Operation King Dragon by the Burmese junta, the first wave of Rohingya refugees entered Bangladesh in 1978. An estimated 200,000 Rohingyas took shelter in Cox's Bazaar. Diplomatic initiatives over 16 months resulted in a repatriation agreement, which allowed the return of most refugees under a process facilitated by UNHCR. The return of refugees to Burma has been the second largest repatriation process in Asia after the return of Cambodian refugees from Thailand. In 1982, the citizenship law enacted by the Burmese military junta did not list the Rohingya as one of the 135 national races of Burma. This made much of the Rohingya population in Burma stateless in their historical homeland of Arakan. After Burmese military junta began persecuting the political opposition following Aung San Suu Kyi's victory in the 1990 election & the earlier 1988 Uprising,or 8-8-88 Uprising, military operations targeting Muslims (who strongly favored the pro-democracy movement) began in Arakan State. The Rohingya-led NDPHR political party was banned & its leaders were jailed. Suu Kyi herself was placed under house arrest by the junta led by General Than Shwe. As the Burmese military increased its operations across the country, the Maungdaw, Buthidaung & Rathedaung townships in northern Arakan became centers of persecution. The 23rd & 24th regiments of the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Army) were responsible for promoting forced labour, rape, the confiscation of houses, land & farm animals, the destruction of mosques, a ban on religious activities & the harassment of the religious priests. An estimated 250,000 refugees crossed over into Bangladesh. Both Bangladesh & Burma mobilized thousands of troops along the border during the crisis. The government of Bangladesh emphasized a peaceful resolution of the crisis. After diplomatic negotiations, a repatriation agreement was put in place to allow the return of refugees to Burma under a UNHCR-supervised process. The Rohingya have faced military crackdowns in 1978, 19911992, 2012, 2015 & 20162017. On 22 October 2017, the UN reported that an estimated 603,000 refugees from Rakhine, Myanmar, had crossed the border into Bangladesh since August 25, 2017. This number increased to 624,000 by November 2, 2017 & over 625,000 by December 6, 2017. The majority are Muslim while a minority are Hindu. According to Human Rights Watch, under the 1982 Myanmar nationality law ""effectively deny to the Rohingya the possibility of acquiring a nationality"". Despite being able to trace Rohingya history to the 8th century, Myanmar law does not recognize the ethnic minority as one of the eight ""national indigenous races"". They are also restricted from freedom of movement, state education & civil service jobs.


The Rohingya community was recognized as an indigenous ethnic nationality of Burma, with members of the group serving as representatives in the Burmese parliament, as well as ministers, parliamentary secretaries & other high-ranking government positions. But since Burma's military junta took control of the country in 1962, the Rohingya have been systematically deprived of their political rights."
ZHANG JX,Myanmar should take them back the Rohingya have the right to be there
Tam Al,"Surprise surprise British/ European colonizers are too blame for this disgrace to humanity along with the vile Myanmar government. The fault lies with the British as they took the rohingyas to Arakan 100s of years ago for cheap labour and to work the land.  They then botched up the border when retreating after WW2, leaving the rohingyas within a hostile fragmented Myanmar where they were constantly persecuted by the scumbag Myanmar army thereon. Also to those stating these people should go back to Bangladesh by that logic then the one million plus Burmese/ Myanmar origin people in Bangladesh should go back to Myanmar. Oh wait the Burmese/ Myanmar origin people in Bangladesh  are actually recognised as citizens in Bangladesh, allowed to go to school, vote etc despite  being against Bangladesh in its independance war in 1971. Just miles across the border on the other hand Myanmar is comitting genocide against the rohingya men, women and little children  despite their connection to the Arakan region for hundreds of years. Absolutely appalling."

Mark mcgill,Areas such as this along with many others should be eliminated. These areas are a cancer to humanity since they have done nothing but breed and then ask for aid. Either a devine wipeout or a manmade event must occur to stop these prolific breeders .

Share my dreams... as I sleep,
Share dreams.....  buried deep in a childs fragile frame
My name is Ayesha...
Share Fire flies in starry skies as they crystalize the calm around me
View visions of a place Called peace that profoundly place a heart within me.
Rest soundly, share my dreams. 

Come into my village, to this hut clad in straw,  through it's door... 
Share my home....Share brown rats knawing bamboo flooring, 
Clawing in crevices for lone grains of rice, twice... 
Mistaking the tips of my toes for disposed seeds, 
My warm flesh supplying insatiable needs, 
Look close, see me bleed, stay here, share my poverty. 

Share chilled droplet dew, eloping from palm rooves... a pre-cursor to the monsoon.
Like Blood spots from Rangoon this moisture hangs waiting to swiftly awaken me.
Lay damp down Beside me... lie here....share my chill.

Share surprise as my eyes try to reach for the light, try to bleach out the night, but... remain Tightly shut as I strain to prise lashes matted closed with the ashes of sandlewood Fires ...that kept me warm in the twilight, then lost that fight by dawn's plight, stay blind... Share my darkness.


Feel the sun try to warm me, feel its beams rudely storm me,  and though
They can't warn Me, too soon they shall mourn me...
Stay here, share that morning.

Share the bark of  my dog, smell the fear in his eyes as he strains at the vine chain,
Hear him Whimper then die as steel finds his neck, slices through fur,
Come friend..... hear the Darkness return to the cur.
Share the crack of a twig as large boots snap branchlets and rifles are
Shouldered to tare up my hamlet with voluntary violence and flames that engulf, stay still share my horror, hold your Breath, share my truth.
Share  the rage at my side, as the first fist impacts me, know the bruise as it swells, Like the Shadows around me, watch them pile into Kadir, at two he's the youngest, the lightest, The babe, the infant, the sweetest. share disgust as his skin swiftly sucks in the blade, share Blood gushing from him, be shocked, be affraid, as he flies like a football on the end of a Kick,  then lies limp like a hooked fish being beaten by sticks,
 Don't you dare look away now,  stay Here,share my guilt.
Share the laughter of strangers as they turn on my sister, share her spluttering cries as they line up to kiss her, as they rip at her torso, like wolves in a pack, don't you dare turn away now, feel This brutal attack. share the facts as they happen, in colour 3d, not through your Tv, your smart phone, your pc.

 Stay here, suffer with me, look on share my rage.
Share screams as my hair is being torn from my skull, share the drain on my courage as it Seeps from my soul, share urine now running down a teenagers legs, Mouth pleas as I Blubber, I cower, I beg, Share howells from my mother being dragged through the dirt, taste the salt in her teardrops, wallow helpless in her hurt as her daughter is raped like a ragdoll before her and is left here to die, share real fear as it stuns her.
Share My eyes as they falter with a short final breath, stating ""I am Rohingja"", be here ...share my death.
Share in my wish, that ethnic cleansing won't last, let it surf from this tide of distopian iconoclasts, who crave for ideals that their lands should be pure, share this mortal's dismay  as destruction  endures.
Share the prize of a lady, share her gold centrepiece, she won it for freedom, she won it for peace, But now she says nothing as my race is  erased, share my people uprooted,denied and Displaced. Share in the silence of Aung San Suu Kyi, share in the violence her hypocracy Brought me, I am Rohingja and Myanmar haunts me.
Stay here as I die, share this hell as it taunts me.

Share my dreams, as I sleep, 
Share dreams buried deep in this childs perished frame, my name........ was Ayesha, I was your host, I am Rohingja,  Myanmar's ghost.

GOD bless bangladesh for investing so much economically and socially to re establish the refugees who were made homeless by cruel myanmar regime.
The point to be noted is bangladesh is still a develooing country but it showed huge heart in relocating the poor rohingyas without even thinking about its own loss. And i feel this is the reason even GOD mercy and help is with bangladesh that their economy and gdp is growing with such huge pace."

Once Bangladesh's Chittagong and Myanmar's Arakan were together. This is why their language is same but Rohingyas are not the people of Chittagong. Arakan is their land. When the British govt. divided Indian sub continent, they gave Chittagong to Bengal(India) and Arakan to Myanmar. That is when Chittagonian people became Bangali and Rohingya people became Myanma. Chittagong and Arakan together could have been a separate country but that didnt happen."

Charon Light,Well the western mainstream media over simplified the issue and never mentioned about the other side of the story. Fuelling the hate towards the Myanmar people. Many recognised ethics groups are suffering for a decade under military dictatorship and never truly care.

kid has table. kid has twin brother. twin brother sits next to kid. one day, unknown kid from another table wants to sit at place where twin brother sits. kid gets mad at unknown. unknown wants seat, but can't have because kid is defensive because unknown is not twin brother. unknown claims that unknown sat there before twin brother, but has no proof. kid and unknown fight, twin brother gets caught in fight though had nothing to do with the fight."

Vish Nu,Who is here after Myanmar military coup
Blighty Sun,Rohingya should be given citizenship
Demon Slayer,"This topic is still debated in INdia as the Norther-eastern part of India is still affected by a sort of misrepresentation of identity. Not because we're trying to chase people away but these group of people who happed to called ""Mias"" here seem to representing the ethnic indigenous people here and have distorted the history. 
To understand this, we really need to go back to the history about the formation of the Bengal state under the British GOvt and the creation of East Pakistan. 
So just to mention the gist of it, the Region of Bangladesh did not have these ""Rohingya"", ""Mia"" or ""Bengali"" population as an ethnicly indigenous group. Even now in Bangladesh they do recognise Communities such as ""Mechs"", ""Kochs"", ""GAros"", ""Jaintias"", ""Chakmas"", as the indigenous of the Country/region.
That is why these people cannot claim citizenship as a historically indigenous community, which they happen to most often do. However, other forms which are cosidered legal forms of claiming citizen are always tolerated surely in Myanmar and definitely in India. 
All of these confusions starts with the communal Hindu-Muslim conflicts and the reason for the Muslims' needing to creat a seperate country for themselves. This is a sad reality but, all of us, i'm sure who border this country of Bangladesh, surely cannot understand why theire fraternised populas has been fleeing their country which they formed inorder to safeguard their religious community."
thulomanchay,"They did not assimilate is an understatement.
Most of them were fresh off the boat Bangla Deshis, masquerading as Rohingyas.
Those that can't speak any Burmese dialects,  don't know the name of their village chiefs, can't name near-by towns or villages in their district, don't know the local names of  vegetables or fruits,  are deemed Bengalis from Bangla Desh.
Look at them, they are indistinguishable from Bangla Deshis too.
Its unfortunate that the genuine Rohingya became victims of their brethren from across the sea.
A few hundred have been accepted back into Myanmar.
There are ""Rohingya"" refugees that has indicated that they will refuse to go back into Myanmar. 
The term Rohingya refugee is advantages to those people, and the United Nations in sorting out the crisis.
Those Bengalis have no home. Their mud flats of the delta region in Bangla Desh  has been washed away by climate change. Bangla Desh don't want to  take responsibility for them. The country is over populated. So for the UN its Myanmar.
 Myanmar isn't going to oblige."

Holy Nightwing fan,"I think these so called ""buddhists"" have never read nor followed their own teachings:









""Hatred is never appeased by hatred in this world. By non-hatred alone is hatred appeased. This is a law eternal."" (Dhp I - 5)









""One who, while himself seeking happiness, oppresses with violence other beings who also desire happiness, will not attain happiness hereafter."" (Dhp  X - 131)









""Overcome the angry by non-anger; overcome the wicked by goodness; overcome the miser by generosity; overcome the liar by truth."" (Dhp XVII - 223)









""One should not strike a holy man, nor should a holy man, when struck, give way to anger. Shame on him who strikes a holy man, and more shame on him who gives way to anger."" 





""He who does no evil in deed, word and thought, who is restrained in these three ways  him do I call a holy man."" 





""Not by matted hair, nor by lineage, nor by birth does one become a holy man. But he in whom truth and righteousness exist  he is pure, he is a holy man.""(Dhp XXVI - 389, 339, 391)









""He abused me, he struck me, he overpowered me, he robbed me."" Those who harbor such thoughts do not still their hatred.



""He abused me, he struck me, he overpowered me, he robbed me."" Those who do not harbor such thoughts still their hatred. (Dhp I - 3,4)"

If anyone could tell me where he links sources, I would really appreciate it!"
nadjjo,"So Burma comes and invades a territory outside of their initial kingdom, (expects them by now to just be Burmese!) they dont control who comes and goes along their territory, a century later there is a settled group of people who has a different political view than the majority of the Burmese, and when the Burmese take control they write their laws in a way that specifically outcasts the groups that have opposed them before... expecting them to leave their settlements because the Burmese just picked a random point in their history to define themselves (what suits them) ignoring the actual situation on the ground... and they expected that would be cool and go smoothly..??? What??!

And now the Burmese go like we dont like to talk about it, because people view us negatively... after systematically refusing to recognize a group of people, denying them their rights and brutally fighting them.. what am I missing from the Burmese point of view?"

Iqbal Tuhin,"Rohingya issue is a creation of British and Burmese colonial rule in Arakan. Arakan was the kingdom of its own or under the vessel of Bengal Sultanate. Arakan and Bengal had a friendly relationship of Busines, Cultural ties, and people's movement for hundreds of years. We also have a well respected big community of Rakhine people in Bangladesh with Bangladeshi citizenship. All the problem happened after Burmese annexation of Arakan. British colonies made this problem even bigger by dividing countries with an ethnic and religious line. Simple we can say Rohingya people, and their land is wrong borderline. Northern Arakan should be included in Bangladesh or Arakan itself should be one single country as it was historically.  Finally, modern-day countries can not be based on only one language, religion or ethnic group. Everyone should live peacefully and respect the fellow human being regardless of their ethnicity, belief, and language. We should search for the strength in unity and diversity. Rather than destroying the Rohingya community Myanmar should use this community to develop its economic and cultural relations with Bangladesh and the Muslim world! You can't change the neighbours, so let us work together towards prosperity rather than fighting. We should learn from hundreds of years of Europen ethnic conflict and the united, prosperous EU. Peace and humanity should prevail!"
You Rika,"I wish and pray that Rohingyans can find a perfect place in this world. Any  human being deserves to live happy and accepted in the community. Most of all, children doesn't deserve this, they need a better place."

Manish Kumar,"Its unfortunate to see half baked journalism here....Rohingyas are not ethnically from Myanmaar. They belonged to the Eastern Bangladesh region from where British took them to work in their plantations in Myanmaar. 

The Rohingya issue has a past which most don't know. In 1942 they were given greater provincial control of Rakhine province by the British in exchange for support in WW 2. They had then suppressed the local Buddhists........it's only that things have come a full circle and that they are on the recieving end now.

Also, the protector of the Rohingyas...i.e. the Arakan National Army which has fought with the Tadatmaw throughout, has links with the ISI( Pakistan) and Islamic state extremists. Their leader is a Pakistani national funded by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. 

India has never in it's history deported refugees, but we have deported Rohingyas precisely because of the extremist threat which we are already dealing with on our western and Eastern borders.

So basically, stop being idiotic liberals who start shouting about human rights at any opportunity they have....America has enough of those idiots . The world has complex geopolitical issues...understand the whole story and come to a conclusion....you'll realize that the world isn't as is portrayed by half ass journalists who dont have the interest neither the attention span to come to the truth. 

It's not for no reason that even Suu kyi has acknowledged the necessity of the Army's action."

As far as beef is concerned in India, then In Northeast states, Goa and many other parts of India beef are widely sold and consumed. In Mumbai, some five-star restaurants serve beef to foreign tourists. It is only banned for Muslims. Why government still hesitant to pass a bill to ban beef India-wide? Either you ban it completely or allow it for all. When the Bamiyan Buddha statue was destroyed then the whole Afghanist was destroyed by the US bombing.  Don't forget a Muslim's Masjid was destroyed by Hindu extremists then why cry for Bamiyan Buddha? When you do it then you've justification for that and if others do the same then it's a crime."

The Lost Travellers,"Izlam has been wiping out communities and has been destroying their culture, heritage etc for centuries. Look at Afghanistan, Pakistan, Malaysia, Iran, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Mauritius and India. Even Europe is suffering now. Standing against Izlam and criticising it isn't Islamophobia but a natural reaction. Unfortunately, this (the way Burma and China are dealing) is the only way to deal with it. Another way was education but Izlamic countries censor that too. So there isn't any other way out buddy. These so called indian seculars are either ignorant or they are still sleeping or maybe they are being paid. Tough times ahead my friends."

Thura Htun,"I am from Myanmar and I must state a few things. Myanmar government is now welcoming Rohingyas back to their homes. If they want to return, they can come back. Myanmar gives citizenship to them but yes, there are some rules and regulations on granting them citizenship, as there are also many illegal migrants from Bangladesh as well as terrorists returning from their training in Middle-East. They must show some documents or proof that they have been living in Myanmar since before the beginning of the crisis. Also, these Rohingyas don't want to return to Myanmar and very few have returned since the government starts accepting them. Our country is very poor.
Myanmar can grant them citizenship but do not accept them as one of the ethnic groups. We have Chinese, Indians, Muslims, Armenians, in our country as well. They are citizens but not ethnic groups. I am very sorry that the situation escalated to this extent. I hope they will find a solution to this crisis."

Kachin Channel,"The word 'Rohingya' comes from the word 'Rakhine'. Rakhine is the State where the Rakhines live in Myanmar. In Rohingya language, the Rohingya people call Rakhine State 'Rahinya' or 'Rahingya'. And the Rohingya language is a branch of (70 to 80 per cent the same with) Chitagonian bangladeshi (bangali) dialect.
So to put it simple, the word Rohingya refers to the people of Rakhine State or the Rakhine State in this Bengali dialect. This term 'Rohingya' is the word used by the bangali or banglas who settled in Rakhine State to differentiate and show where they are from (to say that they are bangalis who settled in Rakhine State). I am Rohyingya means, in their rohingya bangali dialect, I am from Rakhine State."

The BJP government is not doing upto the mark for which we voted for them, they are trying very less for indic restoration but on the other side why we people are silent, I am saying indic collective people, we should raise voice in massess to outnumber those squeaks who wants this nation to be Islamic, I am saying those people who always try to find opportunity to support Islamic agenda to convert this country into Islamic State by changing demographics, insulting, humiliating sanatani culture or in general indic culture. We should try at least at our own level.BJP Government cannot pass every second judgement against these because they are bound for vote banks as they want to be in power than restoring indic identity. So wake up share sai deepak videos to everyone, raise your voice at least if can't at least support people who raise their voice... If these shits can do protest and compell government to knee down why can't we take steps to restore our indic identity by abolishing governments decision which directly or indirectly us threat to indic identity."

Shreemayi Dasgupta,"In my view Rohingyas are not persecuted based on religion. The issue dates back before India's independence. Most of them moved from  Chattagram district of undivided Bengal (now Bangladesh) to Arakan area of Myanmar (earlier BURMA). AS THE AREA BECAME A MUSLIM MAJORITY AREA , they started demanding partitioning of Myanmar to separate that area from Myanmar to form a separate MUSLIM STATE. THEY FORMED THEIR OWN ARMY AND FORCEFULLY TRIED TO ESTABLISH A NEW  ISLAMIC COUNTRY. They got support from some Muslim Fundamentalist group from  some Muslim countries. They also wanted support of MR.JINNAH but was not very successful as MR.JINNAH was busy partitioning India to create ISLAMIC STATE OF PAKISTAN. Myanmar government deployed army to tackle the ROHINGYA ARMY. Initially, the Myanmar army was not successful, but after reinforcement they defeated the Rohingya Army and drove them out of Myanmar. Hence, I don't find any ""religious persecution"" on the part of Myanmar Government in the case of Rohingya Muslims. THEY TRIED TO PARTITION MYANMAR AND HENCE, THEY WERE DRIVEN OUT. HENCE, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THEY WILL NOT JOIN THE SEPARATIST GROUPS IN INDIA AND WILL NOT BECOME A POTENTIAL SECURITY THREAT FOR INDIA. THEREFORE, THEY SHOULD BE SENT BACK TO MYANMAR OR BANGLADESH (AS THEY HAVE ENTERED INDIA THROUGH BANGLADESH) AS SOON AS POSSIBLE."

O Lord, write my name in the Lambs book of life.  Now get a bible, KJV and read it. Obey all the commandments of Jesus Christ. Your eternal security depends on this. You must confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe that God raised him from the dead and then you will be saved. Romans 10:9-10. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten  Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
SOME SCRIPTURES STATE BELLOW ABOUT JESUS CHRIST AS WRITTEN IN THE BIBLE
Colossians 2:9 - For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily Titus 2:13 - looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ Jesus Christ the faithful witness says in Revelation 1:8 - I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, says the Lord, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty. 1 Timothy 3:16 - And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, Justified in the Spirit, Seen by angels, Preached among the Gentiles, Believed on in the world, Received up in glory. Philippians 2:5-7 - Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bond-servant, and coming in the likeness of men.  1 Timothy 6:14-16 - our Lord Jesus Christ's appearing, which He will manifest in His own time, He who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see, to whom be honor and everlasting power. Amen.   Isaiah 9:6 - For unto us a Child is born, Unto us a Son is given; And the government will be upon His shoulder. And His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.  john 1:1-4 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.2 The same was in the beginning with God.3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.4  In him was life; and the life was the light of men.  John 1: 14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.  Psalms 45: 6-7 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre. Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.  John 8:58 Jesus said to them, ""Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am.""  Psalms 110 The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool."

Jim Wu,"The best solution is for the Rich international communities to come together and give a basic survival salary to each Rohingyan, so any host country will welcome these group of refugees and keep the host country(Bangladash) economy flourish."
Jim Wu,"Another point is that the Rohingya community aren't willing to cooperate with the government, to give up, to betray their extremist members, just like a normal cop won't report a bad murderous cop abiding the code of silence. That made the normal cop as an accomplice to the bad cop murders, just like the BLM. The only option for the Government to be safe and to protect its other citizens is to evict the whole group as a whole"

mike llona,Stupid country and leader doesn't deal with this
Hein Aung Swe,"That is not true. Firstly most of  bangali terrorists were attacked Myanmar police stations and killed so many native Arakan people who are Myanmar citizens. After that Myanmar military made counter terrorism strike. So many bangali terrorists took fire their houses and pushed their villagers to go to Bangladesh. Due to western media and some countries' fake news, all over the world know this condition is as genocide. That is not true. We know only Bangali , no Rohingya. They are not Myanmar citizens and they can't speak Myanmese language. Myanmar people accept that their ethnic group include only 135 ethnic group, not include bangali ( they called them self rohingya ). These Bangali people come from Bangaladesh. So RT should present fairly and truly, thank RT."

Wolter Bijleveld,It's all about survival. Some people you can't live peacefully with. Muslims love to fight.
Captain Junayd Riyadh-Al-Hasnayn,"The medical industry as we know it was created by the Rockefeller family. The legislatures under Rockefeller's leadership set up the American League of Municipalities which controlled all the towns in the U.S., and the American Association of State Government which controlled the states. He used the state legislatures to draft new methods for controlling doctors and hospitals. All doctors and hospitals had to be licensed through the state legislature. You had to go through John D. Rockefeller to get a medical license and a hospital license. That's why we're put on medications for the rest of our lives. It's against the AMA procedures to cure anyone. You buy from the Rockefeller drug companies and go to the Rockefeller hospitals. They created Medicare and Medicaid to control the doctors and hospitals with taxpayer money so the drug companies can get the money for their drugs. The people who can't afford the drugs, our government, through our tax dollars pay for them. ""Murder By Injection,"" Eustace Mullins

Not only do they control the doctors, they control their education, here and all over the world.

( Be Just )

Quran 5:8
'' O you who believe! stand out firmly for God, as witnesses to fair dealing, and let not the > HATRED OF OTHERS TO YOU < make you swerve to wrong and depart from justice. Be just: that is next to piety: and fear God. For God is well-acquainted with all that ye do. ''

Quran 4:58
 '' Indeed, God commands you to render trusts to whom they are due and when you judge between people to judge with justice. Excellent is that which God instructs you. Indeed, God is ever Hearing and Seeing.''

( God's The Rules Of  War )

Quran 2:190
'' Fight in the way of God > THOSE WHO FIGHT YOU < but do not transgress. Indeed. God does not like transgressors. ''

Quran  2 :193 

 '' And fight them on until there is no more oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in God; but if they cease, Let there be no hostility except to those who practice oppression. ''

Quran 4:90
 ''.........So if they withdraw from you and cease their hostility and offer you peace, in that case Allah has not granted you permission to fight against them.''

Quran 8:61
''And if they seek peace, then you also seek it, and put your trust in God. He is the Hearer, the Knowledgeable.''

( Stand Up For Justice )

Quran 4 :135
 '' Ye who believe! stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to God, even as against > YOURSELVES, < or your parents, or your kin, and whether it be (against) rich or poor: for God can best protect both. Follow not the lusts (of your hearts), lest ye swerve, and if ye distort (justice) or decline to do justice, verily God is well-acquainted with all that ye do.''

( Who Are The Good Human Beings? )

Quran 2.177
'' Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but [true] righteousness is [in] one who believes in God, the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets and gives wealth,> IN SPITE OF LOVE FOR IT,< to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveler, those who ask [for help], and for freeing slaves; [and who] establishes prayer and gives charity; [those who] fulfill their promise when they promise; and [those who] are patient in poverty and hardship and during battle. Those are the ones who have been true, and it is those who are the righteous. ''

( Freedom To Believe And To Reject )

Quran 2:256
'' Let there be no compulsion in religion. Truth stands out clear from error ''

Quran 10:99
'' And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed - all of them entirely. Then would you compel the people in order that they become believers? ''

( Tolerance For Other Religions )

Quran 109: 1- 6

Say,""O disbelievers,

I do not worship what you worship.

Nor are you worshipers of what I worship.

Nor will I be a worshiper of what you worship.

Nor will you be worshipers of what I worship.

For you is your religion, and for me is my religion.""

( Protection for Idol Worshiper )

 Quran 9:6
 ""And if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that he may hear the words of Allah. Then deliver him to his place of safety. That is because they are people who do not know. ""

Quran16:125
Call people to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good teaching, and argue with them in the most courteous way

Quran7:199 Be tolerant....

( Friendship With Non Muslims )

Quran 60:8
'' God does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, God loves those who act justly. ''

( Do Christians And Jews and  ""OTHER"" non-Muslims go to Heaven? )

Quran 2:62
'' Those who believe (in the Qur'an), and those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), and the Christians and the Sabians,-> ANY <- who believe in God and the Last Day, and work righteousness, shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. '' ---> { On Judgement Day }

( According to the Quran Christians and Jews worship TRUE God )

(Quran 3:113-114)
'' Not all of them are alike: Of the People of the Book ( Christians and Jews ) are a portion that stand (For the right): They rehearse the Signs of God all night long, and they prostrate themselves in adoration. They believe in God and the Last Day; they enjoin what is right, and forbid what is wrong; and they hasten (in emulation) in (all) good works: They are in the ranks of the righteous.''

Note: According to the Quran that Jesus is not God nevertheless Christians still worship one '' TRUE '' God.
 
( Allah Is The Protector Of  Monasteries, Churches, Synagogues And The Mosques )

Quran 22:40
[They are] those who have been evicted from their homes without right - only because they say, ""Our Lord is God ."" And were it not that God checks the people, some by means of others, there would have been demolished monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which the name of God is much mentioned. And God will surely support those who support Him. Indeed, God is Powerful and Exalted in Might.

( Why  Are There So Many Different Religions In The World ? )

Quran 5 48
''...... If God wanted He could have made all of you a single nation. But He willed otherwise in order to test you in what He has given you;(scriptures) therefore try to excel one another in good deeds. Ultimately you all shall return to God; then He will show you the truth of those matters in which you > DISPUTE <.''

NOTE:
Quran 3:85
''If anyone desires a religion other than Islam ( > submission < to God), never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (All spiritual good)''

My explanation of above verse

Islam mean > submission < to God

( The above verse saying is that God will not accept a religion from the ""MUSLIM"" and the Non-Muslims but total > submission < to God.)

Question: How Can Muslim And the Non-Muslim > submit < to the God?

Answer: Be kind to other human beings and Do not lie, Do not steal, Do not cheat, Do not hurt others, Do not be prideful and Do the charity work.

 ( God Allow Muslims To Marry And Eat Food From the Christian And Jew And Vice Versa )

Quran 5;5
''This day [all] good foods have been made lawful, and the food of those who were given the Scripture ( Christian and Jew) is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them. And [lawful in marriage are] chaste women from among the believers and chaste women from among those who were given the Scripture ( Christian and Jew) before you, when you have given them their due compensation, desiring chastity, not unlawful sexual intercourse or taking [secret] lovers. And whoever denies the faith - his work has become worthless, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.''

( Kindness Toward Atheists / Apostate )

Quran 60:8
'' As for such [of the unbelievers( atheist)] as do not fight against you on account of [your] faith, and neither drive you forth from your homelands, God does not forbid you to show them kindness and to behave towards them with full equity: for, verily, God loves those who act equitably. ''

( All The Terrorists / Killers Will Enter Hell Fire )

 Quran 5:32
""......Whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely......""

( Turned Your Enemies Into Your Best Friends )

Quran 41:34
""The good deed and the evil deed are not alike. Repel the evil deed with one which is better, then lo! he, between whom and thee there was enmity (will become) as though he was a bosom friend.""

( The Husband and  The Wife Are > Protecting Friends < One Of Another )

Quran 9:71
''And the believers, men and women, are > Protecting Friends < one of another; they enjoin the right and forbid the wrong, and they establish worship and they pay the poor-due, and they obey God and His messenger. As for these, God will have mercy on them. Lo! God is Mighty, Wise.''

 Quran16:97
  To whoever, male or female, does good deeds and has faith, We shall give a good life and reward them according to the best of their actions. 

 Quran 30:21
  And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you > affection and mercy <--> { Love }

 The Prophet Muhammad said, Heaven lies under the feet of your mother.

( Human Are One family )

Quran 49:13
"" O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise (each other). Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of God is (he who is) the most righteous of you. And God has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things).""

( All The Racist People Will Enter Hellfire )

Quran 30:22
 ""And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the diversity of your languages and your colors. Indeed in that are signs for those of knowledge.""

My comment:

The > BASIC < message of God to the human is that '' YOU '' believe in God and be kind to other human beings / animals and in the > RETURNED < God will > REWARD < you with a new life in Paradise.

* The Quran ONLY guides you how to become a good human being ""Nothing Else"".

* You are a good  human being or a bad human being that is YOUR choice.

* No one can force you to become a good human being.

* You MUST work HARD to become a good human being.

* Why  should ''YOU'' do good deeds and avoid bad deeds?

* Do Good - it's for You. Do Bad - It's against you.

* '' YOUR'' life is a TEST from God that you will choose to do either Good or Bad.

* Find the excuse to help others and forgive others NOT the other way around.

* '' YOUR '' final destination is either Hell or Heaven.
.
* So work HARD toward choice of  YOUR destination.
.

 '' If you do good, you will do so for your own good. And if you do evil, it will be to your own loss.''."

Barrhaven Corner,"Bangladesh did their best so far for the Rohingya refugees and trying to move them to a better place. With better living, food, education for the children, health, shelter, and some means to lead their livelihood involving agriculture. UN is not doing their part so far and not supporting these measures. Last three years more than a million Rohingyas just destroyed the ecology of Cox's Bazar and at the same time, the Rohingyas need to be relocated to a better place. In my opinion, most of the UN and NGO workers don't want to be relocated to a remote place as it will cut some of their personal benefits; presently they are living in the 5start hotels in the heart of the main touristic district of Bangladesh. At the same time, the UN and the world community have totally failed to create any pressure on to Myanmar govt to bring them back though. Let Bangladesh Govt do his job for the benefit of her one people and for the benefit of the Rohingya people too."

God Killer,As a buddhist im ashamed of myanmar
Sky Watcher,"Things are far more complicated. Part also of the history was when the British was retreating from Arakan in WW2, they armed the Rohingya to fight off the Japanese when they reach the area.  The Rohingya however killed the local Burmese.  

As cited in the video, the Rohingyas came from India and Bangladesh (called Eastern Pakistan back then) to work for the British for agriculture and others. The Rohingya enjoyed favor from the British to ensure their loyalty, which they know they cannot expect from the Burmese who were against their colonization.  The Burmese were considered the bottom tier or lowest class in their own land

The Rohingya weren't an innocent victim at all.  In more recent years, they killed locals and attacked over 15 police stations and a military camp, killing policemen and soldiers. 

ARSA was the most recent rebel secessionist group they had. They issued videos resembling that of ISIS, Al Qaeda and Taliban, standing behind a flag with the speaker flanked by armed masked men.  

The ARSA can be partly blamed for the exodus of the Rohingya. They forget the Tatmadaw is a very fierce force to contend with. 

What sparked the public's anger was the rape and murder of a Burmese woman by 4 Rohingyas.  All hell broke loose after the incident.  

The Rohingya is a sad victim of history and Imperial Britain who did not fulfill their promise of a state of their own. They remain a stateless people to this day. 

The Rohingya still long to go back to Myanmar which they consider home.  Only Myanmar can give them hope.  One can only hope for reconciliation and a peaceful resolution to the Rohingya crisis."

If the Rohingyas are the true citizens of a disolved kingdom in Arakan Region, why Myanmar didn't want to recognise them and let them live and inherit their lands? This is to show that the present government of Myanmar, I'm so sorry to say this, is heartless and greedy. That's why you are still not improving as a country because of this. "

Just the one subject that is why people don't believe anything anymore why can't they be honest about it its still bad that any drawings were of houses burning etc doesn't he realise this and a lot more believable too. The way kids minds work it would be unacceptable for them not to think of other things as well. That doesn't mean the impact is any less on them I don't guess that if they don't think of the conflict constantly it didn't have the big impact children are not like that it's as if they are not allowed to do what children do and that worries me more than the war itself let them get on with being children and they may even teach adults a thing or two"

Nigrodha, you may think: The contemplative Gotama says that just to get more disciples. But you shouldnt think that way. May your master remain your master. 

Or you may think: He wants us to abandon our rules. But you shouldnt think that way. May your rules remain the same. 

Or you may think: He wants us to abandon our way of life. But you must not think that way. May your way of life remain the same. 

Or you might think: He wants us to do things that according to our teaching are wrong and are considered by us to be. But you shouldnt think that way. May those things that you think are wrong continue to be considered that way. 

Or you may think: He wants to keep us from those things that according to our teaching are correct and are considered by us to be like this. But you shouldnt think that way. May those things that you think are right continue to be considered that way. Nigrodha, I do not speak due to any of these causes ...




There are, Nigrodha, awkward things that have not been abandoned, contaminated, that lead to rebirth, terrifying, that produce painful results in the future, associated with birth, aging and death. It is for the abandonment of these things that I teach Dhamma. 
If you practice accordingly, these contaminated things will be abandoned, and the things that lead to purification will develop and increase, and you will achieve and remain, performing for yourself in the here and now the fullness of the perfection of wisdom.  (DN 25)"

- Is it possible to rehabilitate refugees within 100 km of the country under international refugee law?

Me: Slaughtering Cow is prohibited in Buddhism, in fact most of European countries becoming non vegetarian.

But these are the same people who write explosive Article Against Asia on Human rights watch and want us make poor forever, we pretty do understand these dirty games. 

Rohingya is a not our problem, but they have to live with our principles like we live, or we all Aisan country will make a artifical island for them. 

So, Islam is not dirty, but the politicians who improvise them are dirty. Like Erdogan."
binyamin,"Case or example

I feel that the state can print more money and less debt .. Army buildings or spy buildings but it prints money inside .. the money can be used to buy weapons, conduct research, prevent country debt, invest in other countries, make loans to the country other .. because the military building is a secret which should not be known by others ... can you investigate for that .."
Andy Yong Yew Kuan,"Er.. Suddenly no response from international community? What happened? No brexit can take in some lower wage workers instead of talking nonsense and highlighting the plight of the Uighurs which had been over politicized. Ask that Uighur person that so happen to had ""Escaped"" to look at the world in a more Holistic manner. That's how Chinese immigrants are thought. Always look back and think of those who has lesser and it is much more calming and uplifting rather then always looking up higher and higher ending up taking Xanex daily.  Looking behind also to check if there are anybody left behind. It's not a race but a Marathon. I think now even worst due to the pandemic +  trade war, it has generally became a stroll. Strolling is fine, just remember to stop to smell the rosses "

Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated country in the world with a developing country status, a crisis like this is a huge burden on Bangladesh. The world needs to address this Myanmar caused crisis urgently and force Myanmar to take Rohingyas back to Rakhine state of Myanmar and give them their citizenship back with all the safety and security a nation offers to all her other citizens. Rohingyas have been living in ""Arakan"" (renamed ""Rakhine"") for centuries. So one cannot call them immigrants from Bangladesh."

Ironically the greatly educated and literate lot who could change these scenarious with unity rejoices their luxurios wondering as if he is not a human of this world. I think there should be a massive media campaign into boycotting all leaders around world, either it be chosen by party or in any form be boycotted ever of trying to create hatred amongst the humans , A white collar leaders should take a lead against such movements, Peroid , LOVE from Dr. Sarfraj Ansari from Nepal ."

Well.. the outside world has as six decades... especially the last two.. What have they done.. most of them have never been to Burma.. except to stand on the fringes of despair.. Suu Kyi has two decades of sacrifice .. endured punishment.. walked the talk. Now, she has put Burma on the international stage... given her people a taste of freedom.. and put Burma on the road to Democracy.. one again the international community is conspicuous in their absence... Please place the blame where it lies.. with the Generals.. and not the must respected civilian government.."
Stephen Monash,"Of course she is willing to stop ethnic conflict which has existed for decades.. but as she is not the leader.. and real power resides as it has for six decades with the Junta.. she is not able. The criticism as mentioned by the man in the video.. should be targeted at the Generals who are using Suu Kyi as a scape goat.. with the intent of saying . there it happened on her watch. These generals are pure evil.. and have duped the outside world yet again.. By the way the outside world states.. non govt organisations have sat idly by for six decades whilst the Burmese people were subjected to rape.. murder.. torture.. and jail... but did NOTHING. Now they want to blame Suu Kyi .. who has with no assistance from the outside world .. fought the Junta for two decades, hence, her numerous human rights awards. Then leaders in the West.. UK and US led the charge of praising Suu Kyi for having bought Burma to a democracy.. when Suu Kyi .. was trying to calm the hysteria and explain.. that Burma was merely in transition to democracy and had a long way to go. But no. ... on they went ignoring the ethnic conflicts.. ignoring that twenty five percent and proxy or rogue govt soldiers out of uniform made up even more seats in the parliament. Suu Kyi's role was and is a benign one.. as any changes for instance to the badly designed constitution can not be undertaken unless the military approve. The military can also appoint members to parliament and take them out.. unless they consent with the govt. The outside world are doing the Junta's job for them ... The Junta has left Suu Kyi to confront the Hague. defend them... and just sit back immune to criticism. IN other words the gravitas of exigencies in Burma are not understood or grasped by other nation states. And now Gambia with human rights abuses of its own.. joins with other Muslim states to take the charge of genocide to the Hague.  Really...so terrorism is to be snuffed out in other nation states.. but not in Burma. This is a Muslim star chamber who have colluded to use the ethnic crisis in Burma to band together with the Islamic community in Burma many of whom are moderates. It is astounding how inept the international so-called political scientists and analysts are.. completely out of their depth. Suu Kyi meanwhile is once again left holding the bag... her transition to democracy undermined at every turn. Really, pick one world leader who could match her record on human rights... Trump.. or the UK idiot Boris.. whatever his name is.. what about their war crimes .. far worse. If they argue that Suu Kyi is guilty by association.. then they too are guilty by saying and doing nothing for six decades which is far worse.. What a bunch of hypocrites and pathetic cowards the West are."

Peter Christopher Vertannes,"Peter Popham is quite correct in highlighting the fact that Aung San Suu Kyi ""gets all the international flak"" whilst the person who is to blame for all the trouble in Rakhine state, the head of the Armed Forces, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, escapes attention. This was in fact, the Military's intention from the outset  when it formed a parliament and allowed for a general election to take place in 2015. By allowing the NLD to win government it managed to stay in the background and divert both domestic and international criticism away from them whilst the incumbent government took on the responsibility for running the nation. Naturally, as Aung San Suu Kyi said herself, the responsibility falls on their shoulders and so of course they will be criticised harshly not only by the International Community for not living up to the ideals they once espoused but by the people of Burma themselves when they discover that their nation has not moved ahead as promised. The strange thing is that Aung San Suu Kyi knew fully well that her hands would be tied somewhat as both a politician and leader of a nation whose constitution is a farce and whose real power still rests with the Military establishment and yet she went ahead with it, regardless. She must now hold her tongue and pay tribute to them because she has 'sold her soul to the Devil' so to speak. What a far cry from the days when she openly criticised them for almost everything."

Stephen Monash,It was bad and is bad enough that the military Junta is using Suu Kyi as a scape goat.. but for the international community to hold her responsible is beyond belief. Of course she is unable to stop it.. Does anyone (well of course a lot of idiots) of any intelligence really think she fought for two decades... would throw it all away.. and suddenly abandon her ethics.. does her sacrifices have no utility. Oxford university counsel - Canada - Amnesty international ought to be ashamed.. and condemned for this shameful withdrawal of her human rights awards. Why is it these so-called exemplars of efficacy were no where to be found for six decades of oppression. Ethnic conflict has occurred in Burma for thousands of years.... to blame an iconic figure like Suu Kyi is reprehensible .. and decries any hope for mankind. How dare these people who have never spent a a day or a week in Burma pontificate in such an indifferent and ignorant manner.. how dare they carp like hypocrites with their bandwagon mentality. They all ran to be in the photo so to speak when she took the people of Burma to winning an election.. but were absent when the real struggle of two decades.. and five decades for the people was all too apparent. Burma was the silent country.. not just within.. but outside too...the international non govt organizations and leaders were acting as though they were impotent.. did nothing to stop the atrocities of the military junta... and now they have the audacity to blame a seventy one year old lady. In doing this they have collectively set back the struggle for democracy decades as the military junta delight in once again duping the indifferent and uneducated international community.
Stephen Monash,You talk of Aung San Suu Kyi's silence. Where were you all in the twenty years she was under house arrest - what did you do -. Have any of you lived .. worked.. or served at any level in Burma. Have any of you critics ever visited Burma...Your ignorance staggers me.. you indifference infuriates me.. and your hubris knows no bounds. Walk in her shoes for a day... and I am sure you will not be so willing to criticise the lady who put the plight of Burmese people on the map. Sitting in the halls of the chattering classes must be easy for you to bravely cast dispersion towards a country and a lady you know nothing about.

Pls go teach those media vultures who lack total knowledge in politics in Myanmar. It is also worth noting the foolishness in attacking Md. Suu Kyi as a practising Buddhist and taking Buddhism as the measure as yardstick. Oil and water do not mix and even the wisest man will act according to the event and circumstances, the compassionate Lord Buddha said. The call to strip her off the Nobel Peace prize is also telling us the the media is sensationalising this issue to make a quick buck and arouse the audience. In short the media capitalize on peoples' / nation's misery to make news. Do they understand the politics and events leading to the awarding of the Nobel Peace prize? Do the laurette themselves know why and how they were nominated and awarded the NP prize? Revocation of the NP prize amounts to dissolving the organization itself. Can that happen?"

Truth Over Happiness,"Khaleefah Abdul-Majid I, declared his intention to send 10,000 to aid Ireland's farmers. However, Queen Victoria intervened and requested that the Sultan send only 1,000 because she had sent only 2,000 herself.

So theSultansent only the 1,000, but he also secretly sent five ships full of food. The English courts attempted to block the ships, but the food arrived in Drogheda harbor and was left there by Ottoman sailors. That 10,000 that the Sultan pledged to the Irish would be worth approximately 800,000 ($1.7m) today.

It's a wonderful story.

The movie, still in post-production, is built around this charitable act from a Muslim country to a Christian nation, separated by 4,000 miles. At the time the Ottoman Empire was experiencing enormous internal difficulty, but the Sultan Khaleefah Abdul-Majid was determined to help the starving men and women of Ireland. A friendship between two different cultures was formed. In the movie, a Turkish sailor meets an Irish farm girl and she finds herself torn by her emotions."

When are the British government going to stop selling weapons to Saudi-Arabia ? (you know, the country that's killing hundreds of thousands of Yemeni people)

Are there any future plans (besides the slap on the fingers) for Baron Mark Thatcher son of the late Prime-Minister Baroness Margaret Thatcher to actually stand trial for his attempt at a coup d'etat in Guinea aided by an army consisting of mercenaries to instil an Apartheid state there ? (and his many illegal weapons deals, they never did take his title either did they;)

When is the British government going to show it's willing to admit the presence of death squads called The Black&Tans in Ireland's late unpleasantness and that Ulster terrorist were helped by the British Army to murder more innocent unarmed Irish people ? (I know, you keep banging on about IRA terrorist needing to come clean and face the music, but not one Black&Tan, Ulster Terrorist or complicit British Army member has even been named, let alone been prosecuted by the British)"

Hikarinx,"Everywhere I search up Rohinjyas in Burma, all I see are one sided news. You're a news network, at least do your job right and stop being so biased and reporting only from one side. This all started with the Rohinjya terrorist group in Burma called Harakah al Yakin. This terrorist group made up of Rohinjyas attacked government security forces in October 2016 resulting in 40 deaths excluding civilians. They attacked more government posts again in November 2016, more casualties and deaths followed. The terrorist group would bomb these posts and then storm in with a large number of people and slice the necks of whoever was still alive. Also they didn't only target the Burmese people when it came to these brutal murders, they also targeted Hindus and anyone else who was not of their religion. Aung San Suu Kyi has protected the Burmese people even when it meant herself being locked up for decades. She will continue protecting the people no matter the criticism she receives. She is receiving criticism, because these news stations can't see the whole picture, reports one-sidedly, and are brainwashing people. People need to stop being stupid, wake up, and start doing your own research if you really care about these issues."

This is the same script Muslims used in Kosovo, Gaza, Kashmir and other theaters of Jihad. First they massacre non-Muslims, then when the kufrs fight back, the Al Jazeera and western OIC controlled news outlets spin into gear with ludicrous claims of genocide against Muslims.
This is how the modern international jihad works. Don't fall for it again.

One religion of peace is attacked by another religion of peace. so in retaliation the religion of peace forces the other religion of peace out of their homes, and kills those who have attacked them. so the religion of Peace decides to kick the other religion of peace out of their country. knowing that if they kill everybody related to that religion of peace. Then they will no longer be a religion of peace. but if they don't kill that other religion of peace... That religion of peace is going to eliminate all religions. Just to show us how peaceful they really are. it's a conundrum. only the most peaceful will win. or lose"

Si Thu Aung,"Hey Admin of Lawpith, 
Please make sure that you are using the correct information before explaining the Bangali (so far called themselves as Rohingya) issue. Myanmar is ethnic diversity country which living with 135 ethnicities. You claim that the Bangali do not have food and Medicine. In fact, the 69 INGO include UNHCR, WFP, SCI helping bangali in Rakhaine state. As a poor country, Myanmar could not provide every of them. Myanmar government provide them the citizenship to some of the Bangali (Rohingya)  people and as well as called ""white Card"" that have the equal right to vote in the election. So, three of Bangali have sat in Parliment as MPs in the previous government. when the government offer them citizen to Bangali, but they do deny with this because they can not accept the name of Bangali. they calim to become one of the ethnicity in myanmar rather than became citizenship. Please read the ethnicity law in constitution. 
the crisis happening now is between two community. It is not religious issue."

1. they are given Citizenship, voting rights and equal opportunities along with some years of UN observation military in Rakhine state. 

2. These should be minimum guarantees along with some protection from Constitution of Myanmar for minorities like a % share of Rohingya (or minorities) in the military force of Myanmar must be enforced so that even if any other right-wing governments form in future, it can' destroy a section of people in the Country as the Countries military is diversified - this is also very important for the well being of any Country if its forces share all communities if the Country."
DS YAMO,Any government with the capability to expatriate a group of its own citizens for no reason whatsoever is not a government and the failure of the UN to recognize this is telling.
musti mon,Only solution is war with myanmar
Foodie Katha,Susi is a crual wamen.
Prabhat Singh Paranjape,why is the UN trying to send rohingyas back to Myanmar from where they have fled in fear... Are they stupid ?   Its a case of when a whole population of a nation have decided almost tacitly to get rid of a section of it which they have already denied had ever existed in the first place at almost all international levels. No amount of change in the Government will undo what has already been done ... to send them back is to send them essentially to be exploited and killed at the end. Just accept the fact this cant be done... It would be far better for the rohingyas to find permanent stay at some other place ... either in Bangladesh or in the developed world where they would get the chance to live a free life. Myanmar is a lost home now and its time that it is accepted.

Lord Sky Dragon,"Sura 9, Last Testament of Mohammed  commands every muslim believer to seek out and hunt down each and every nonbeliever idolator Quffer; stating clearly that this is the ""holy duty"" of every muslim. So, it is easy to see the origin of this crisis and other similar ones in other parts of the world. These can only be resolved once we stop insisting on political correctness and are prepared to acknowledge the truth and so call a spade a spade and thus work towards reforming islam. "

Tau Arshad,"It's absolutely ignorant for the Burmese to call Rohingyan people Bengali, therefore claiming they belong in Bangladesh. They look alike about apart from that, they speak a different language, have different customs and different histories. It would be like saying a Ukrainian is basically Russian. The state in which they lived in wasn't called Rakhine but the ancient kingdom of Arakan. This is a systematic elemination of a culture."

They 'import' other group of ppl to rule over the locals, making tensions so both side need British to make balance. There was a time when these rohingya ppl did something very nasty to local ppl, where was western media then? If western really want to help, open your border let them flood in"
Thomas O'Mally,"Vox and main stream media is misleading the viewers of youtube. Reporting only Myanmar arm forces action on the conflict. They do not report what makes this action start. An armed insurgents of this so called Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army made a coordinated attack on police forces in Northern Rakhing State. 11 police members died. Myanmar armed forces took action after this.
Actually this so called rohingyas are illegal migrants from over populated Bangladesh. They are ethically, culturally and ginetically different from Myanmar."
la luan,"BBC is trying to cover up the crimes and misdemeanor British colonialists had committed during the occupation India, Burma and Sri Lanka.
British brought in Tamils to Sri Lanka from Tamal Nadu to employ in tea plantations. British brought in Bengalis to Burma to employ in rice fields. British profited from those tea and rice exports. Britain is the culprit of today's problems. French colony Vietnam and Cambodia have no such problems. Dutch colony Indonesia neither."

Rohingya cause a lot of problems in our country and if they come back here they will still cause problems like they used to.

Farhad Faisal,"Why not also report about the safety and sustainability measures that are already taken in Bhasan Char against any potential storm surge etc.? Also, why not hear the Rohingyas, who have already arrived in Bhasan Char, about how they themselves think (rather than only the UN and international NGO etc.'s view from a distance) about the safety and the living conditions in Bhasan Char? If these were done, the reporting could have been a lot better.

Sadly, so far, the UN, the international NGOs, and the international human rights organizations etc. have failed to oblige Myanmar to take back the nearly a million Rohingya refugees (who were violently ""ethnically cleansed"" out of Myanmar in 2017 and escaped in safety across the border into Bangladesh).

In spite of its own resource constrains, Bangladesh has been most generous in giving the Rohingyas protection and shelter. The Bangladesh government as well as the Bangladeshi NGOs are doing their best to help the Rohingya refugees now for years. The refugees are mostly saying in Cox's Bazar district in over crowed camps and most recently more than a thousand of them are moved in a spacious and well built new township in the island of Bhasan Char in the adjacent Bay of Bengal. It has been protected by high dams and high shelters against any plausible storm surge from the Bay of Bengal based on the records of the last hundred and fifty years.

The international community ought to, instead of hesitating, now enact international measures (diplomatic, economic etc.) that would compel Myanmar to take back the Rohingya refugees to their homes in Myanmar and, to ensure their physical safety, to regain (or compensate for) their destroyed property and, finally, to restore their rights as citizens of Myanmar."
Shojib Khan,"The whole bangladesh is a low land. The houses built for rohingas are 1000 times better than the houses of average bangladeshis. Only two problems: if rohingas are relocated there, they won't be able to do their drug business as the security is tight in that island. That's why these rohingas don't wanna move there. And foreign NGOs are against the relocation because their key employees will lose their lavish lifestyle in the 5 star hotels in chittagong and coxes bazar."

Re8et,Can the Rohinja abide their faith and join the Red revolution? A.Kyi can not heal Rohinja's land. Geopolitik interests are just too powerful this time for them to stay. It's hopeless to call for help or understanding or to ask to condemn to betray your own people. You can clearly see it with your eyes where also monks stands. Cities will grow there. It's not Islamophobia.

SeshagiriRao Devaguptapu,This is a Saudi paid prestitute story. There is noise when both hands meet. Where is the side of the Myanmar in this story. A free press is supposed to give both sides. Do you mean to say that there is no other side? That is preposterous unbelievable. The business world needs the Mayanmar resources so they are doing this to pressuring the government. Stop this and let them do what thy think is good for their country. Please redo the story with both sides. Thank you.
kc mohanan,"As clear as day, this has become an issue of ethinicity AND religion. Mostly religion in the current context. 
Sentiments are sych that even Buddhist monks are angry and politicised!! All over the non-muslim world, the Muslims are now looked upon with unwelcome suspicion and even hatred. The reasons for this need no elaboration.
Why can't any of the Muslim countries take them? Why are the other Muslim countries not coming to their aid?"

Ramacat66,"How many of these people immigrated (illegally) to Myanmar within the last 5 years? The last 20? The last 50? This is not an ethnic cleansing case, this is an instance of a permeable border, where massive numbers of migrants have followed into smaller long-standing communities. You would think that the BBC and Economist would catch on when every interview I've seen so far is in a Bengali dialect, not in Burmese. This is really Bangladesh's problem, and its an example of what is to come when countries can not or will not control their population growth and environmental degradation. Local people seek to flee to less populated areas, regardless of national boundaries. This condition will worsen in years to come with more advanced climate change. Its not Myanmar's responsibility to handle the refugees from Bangladesh, and poor countries  have fewer options."

Otherwise they will finish the Muslims from the world. Islam does not forbid to know science and technology. Every Muslim country is backward in science and technology except Pakistan, Iran, Turkey etc. But it is not enough. But they are not as good as America, Russia, Britain, France, China in science and technology specially in modern weapons. So we should develop in modern science and technology specially in modern weapons and rely on Almighty Allah, not weapons. And they should try to remove illiteracy, corruption, terrorism, ignorance, drug addiction, smoking, vulgarity from their country.  Because Islam does not  support it."

si si,Firstly Arkansas kingdom belongs to Rakhine people who is one of the major ethnic races in Myanmar .Rohingya are Bengali who were illegally migrated from Bangladesh .The kingdom which was destroyed in 18 century by Burmese was founded by Rakhine people not Bengali.
Darshan Devaiah Kaiblira,British imported Bengali labourers to Rakhine
Kham Wa,"I think you miss understanding something here. Arakannese and Rohingya are different ethnic group. Arakan used to have its own kingdom and belong to Arakannese not Rohingya. And the genocide first started between Arakannese and Rohingya and later on Burmese military forces got pulled in because of formation of Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army Group which Burmese think it's a terrorist group. Moreover, the vast majority of Arakannese are Buddhist but there's some Arakannese Muslim which is not Rohingya."

They overstayed their welcome and caused nothing but trouble (islamic terorism) to native Burmese people of Buddhist faith. And now they have to go back womp, womp.The end."
Billy Jean,"It seems like British citizens are not exempted from responsibility for this issue at all.
British governors need to stop blaming Myanmar government and take refugees of Rohingya to their country because YOU just brought them to that place to repress Myanmar natives!
How many problems did they make in the world? Most of the genocide on Middle East and Africa is based on crimes by imperialistic Britain government commited a hundred years ago. You British citizens should not to pretent to be innocent, please! Your ancestors are one of the most infamous criminals! Do you know what your ancestors did in India? Have you ever heard about Opium Wars? 

Please be careful when you blame others with issues around the world wide.
You must remember that you are not exempted from responsibility with what your ancestors did around the world."

Theres a few muslimmen in Rakhine kingdom of Rakhine people  and they r know as kamein muslims ( who got ethnic in myanmar), n some Arab trade men n some  Bengali) . You have left out about ethnic Rakhine . Arakan or Rakhine ethnic  is Rakhine buddhists land . In 1824 after first Anglo Burmese war ,  Burmese king lost Rakhine  to British . British imported mass Bengali into Rakhine ( their census showed how much they imported Bengali for cheap labour. Then second wave is in 1971( when there was bengladesh liberation war from Pakistan) . This mass Bengali muslims entered into myanmar is well mentioned in British record. During japan invasion , when British retreated in 1942, British armed Bengali muslims to defend for British . But instead Bengali Muslim  did massacred Rakhine ethnic people ( est50000) . They  looted more than 100 Rakhine  villages , n since then they continue  terrosism under the  namemujahideen , now  changed name to ARSA.they even created fake ethnic name Rohingya in 1951)  n planned to seize Rakhine ethnic land ."

F,"There is no ethnic namely Rohingya in Myanmar or world.
Rohingya is not an ethnic,they are Bangali( immigrated from 
Bangladesh).But their motherland's government (Bangladesh) don't want to
 accept them back. There is no problem if they love different cultures 
(especially buddhists' culture) and want to coexist peacefully. But 
their birth rate is increasing rapidly and ambitiously. Now, there are 25,553 Rakhine nationals and 444,390 Bangalis 
living in Maungdaw,and 46,192 nationals and 230,000 Bangalis in 
Butheedaung. Now, they make an ethnic name and claim for citizenship but
 they deny Myanmar's Citizenship law as  they realize there is no 
possibility of acquiring a nationality. So, they start islamization and 
exploiting Myanmar Crisis with Fake,fabricated by the help of muslim 
countries and wastren medias(like OIC and UN,etc..).A lot of burmese 
buddhist girls murder and rapes  by Rohingyas (Bangali) muslim for a 
long time. But I never seen about that on any medias. Why? Simple, Most 
of the countries on the world are Islamic countries. We coexisting with 
our christian ethnic like Karen, Kachen, Chin without any religious 
problems. Myanmar have a lot 
of foreign immagrants like indians, Napalese, Chinese and so on. We are 
coexisting with them without any problems for a long time. Why? They 
respect our cultures and don't claim for citizenship and ethnic. They 
don't want to invade our land.That is why~~and why? why???? Why did they
 destroy buddhism's honour and image? But I still loving our minority 
myanmar muslim brothers not immigrated Bangali. May all beings free from
 dangers/\"
Sub Zero,"If minorities are treated in a humane manner, if they are not deprived of their basic rights, then perhaps they would not mind being a minority! 

They would not procreate like rabbits to overcome this minority status...The number of conflicts would have sunken to a very low level!!??...If you get my point

The world is chaotic shxt right now and will probably stay that way for a long time but IMO if minority groups, ANY minority group (regardless of creed or religion) know no discrimination...If this day ever comes, then this might be the beginning of a more civilised/harmonious world!!

Just saying"
Aji Palloor,Why don't the UN direct the rich countries who are less populated to allow migration of Rohingyans! Especially gulf countries who will be happy to welcome people from their religion which can be on s special citizenship status? As such Myanmar or the neibhouring countries are struggling to feed own citizens including India.
Noel Relova,"rohingya are muslims, therefore ; muslim countries must absorb their believers."
Soko Tayu,God please please save the Rohingyas. Make this world peaceful. Burma should accept them as a citizen.
Dr. Terror,I hope someday U.S hit some military targets with cruise missiles in Myanmar. So far Bangladesh have done pretty good job in pressuring this Illegitimate Junta State. We will continue to do so until Myanmar take back Rohingya people in the country. We are extremely sick of this oppressive regime.
Ashik S,"Whether buddhist or Anyone cannot stand when their own members are being killed infront of their eyes.
It's time to retaliate not calling buddha always for help and be killed again and again.
""If you hurt us we will retaliate will full force""-This is the mindset that all countries must adapt not always peace. Peace is for those who understand them nt for those who are sinked in religion."

আবু রাইদ,"""One of the things I said in my book is that I went to the Indian National Archives in New Delhi, and I dug up documents from the British colonial period, some of them dating back to 1799, 1826, and 1824, which is when the British had done a census of that whole region. It clearly states that one in three souls in that region are Musulmans of Rohingya origin. The term existed back in 1799. So this idea that its a manufactured term, and these people are illegal, is false. The historical record shows theyve been there for centuries."" (Taken from Jen Kirby)"

They look different than the Burma people, they are more like the Bangladeshis (formerly East Pakistanis). They did not assimilate and when there were issues between the Burmese authorities and the Rohingyas, the Rohingyas formed their armed group and started to ambush the Burmese police patrols. Hence the Burmese, with the urging and support of the Buddhist monks started to call for their expulsion.
Rohingyas don't belong to Myanmar."

Ab by,"Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples:The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses seat.So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach.They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other peoples shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.
Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long;they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called Rabbi by others.
But you are not to be called Rabbi, for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.And do not call anyone on earth father, for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah.The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted"".

You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything, in Heaven above or in the Earth beneath, or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents up to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.

If my people who are called by my name, humble themselves and pray, AND TURN FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS, I will hear from Heaven, will forgive their sins, and will heal their land.

And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standingin the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father,who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.And when you pray, do not keep on babblinglike pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you needbefore you ask him.

This, then, is how you should pray:

Our Fatherin heaven,
hallowed be your name,
your kingdomcome,
your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts,
as we also have forgiven our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from the evil one.

For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.

""Matthew 5-7 NIV Bible Gateway"", we can use google search.
These are the teachings,
The Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ our God.
REPENT, and start doing what is right.
If you abide my teachings, you are really my disciples; then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.

A time is coming and has now come, that the true worshipers will worship the Father in Spirit and Truth. God is Spirit, so his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and Truth; they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.

In the New Heaven and New Earth,
only Righteousness dwells.
May the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God be with you all."

A certain amount of credit ( will ensure) others will speak out. If soldiers who carried out these heanus orders are too scared to come forward then the chances of a mass defection are decreased. This is a good start - and if good intell can be gotten.. then the two soldiers ought to have their sentences reduced - it is important they are not vilified for following orders. The real culprits are the Junta - Generals in charge. Indeed, the West could offer safe haven (but still hold them accountable within the law) to all those who choose to escape the military. It has happened in the past that many low and higher ranked military have fled Burma across the border seeking sanctuary."

weaverbird b,why are they now worried about the rohinga and sang su chi was the biggest prosecutor of the rohinga
Stephen Monash,"The international community by discrediting Suu Kyi has allowed the Junta to fill the void. They saw it as an opportunity to wrest back power and return to the repressive ways of ten years ago and before. A lack of solidarity - a vulgar hubris by the powers that be... Oxford Uni.. Canada.. South Korea and certain groups in the US... have seen the fall from grace of Suu kyi - but more importantly undermined the transition to democracy. This reckless abandonment of solidarity and recognition of decades of effort and sacrifice - just beggar belief.. Shame on ""London school of Economics"" - ""Oxford St Hughes College - Bob Geldoff - Amnesty international - Gwyey you human rights South korea - ""Elie Wiesal awards"" - US  - Freedom of city award from Oxford - and those who bestowed then reneged on the Honorary Canadian Citizenship. You all have blood on your hands. You carped from the sidelines for six decades - did nothing - then jumped on the bandwagon when Suu Kyi put Burma on the international map... then abandoned her whilst she was trying to work from within and transition Burma to democracy."

Aung San Suu Kyi  the so call nobel peace (????) prize winner  went to the UN and ICJ to defend the genocide on Rohingya.
codewalters,Nothing will change.  It's easy to protest but much more difficult to bring about real change.

Wrong doings are wrong doings cannot be exalted and must be condemned even if you are innocently condemned and that is righteousness.

Masaud Ismail,Aljazeera. I have one suggestion. Bring rohingya to your country please...
tracker one,"if people of myanmar don't want to live with rohingyas,nobody can force them to rehabilitate the refugees....rohingyas can get citizenship of more than 50 ""brotherly"" islamic nations as per the concept of ''ummah'' in islamic worldview....10 million rohingyas is not a small number but still they can be distributed among rich oic nations and economically supported and skilled to earn their livelihoods...."

So there are many young people supporting the Rohingiyas but it's still a long way.."
Shahadat Hossain,"The main question is, ""What is the thought of normal people of Myanmar about Rohingya??!!""  

If general people of Myanmar are so much desperate about their democratic right now, one question comes on mind, ""where were these people when Myanmar army were killing Rohingya people in their democratic era?"""
Esther Par,Please help Myanmar Burma please please
Balargus,"What is clear to all is that democracy and genocide cannot coexist. The fates of Burma's Rohingya and Burma's democracy are fundamentally intertwined.

Harrow,"Do not trust their words,the military are not aligned with any goodness in relation to the Rohingya,I mean just look at the displacement and thuggery by the military near the border towards the Kachin people,their land,culture and their ownership of the resourcefull land they own.
This is an example of the military and what they are continuing to do to theKachin people on the border,they are excluding them from any dialogue about their land,resources and repatriations,the military will not negotiate with them,also they are forcibly removing them from their ancestral lands and putting them in camps,the militaries human violations are continuing and ask the question who will be next???"
Abdul Rashid,"I feel, when democratic elected leader was in place, she ignored the plea of Rohingya people even supported her military in Hage court. At the time the Maynmar was with both Aun sang suki & the junta who both didn't not make any attempt to repatriate the Rohingyan people. Now that the military under pressure or not is willing to repatriate them, all of a sudden the whole country is a fan of the Rohingyan people. Was the whole nation asleep when the genocide was being committed? no one saw any demonstration for the Rohingya protection when the genocide was taking place. Hence the perception of safety net from both democratic elected gov & the military who committed genocide is removed & can not be trusted. 
Therefore the USA senators decision sounds much safer for the Rohingya than to trust any of them. At present Aun sang Suki supported are pretending to like the Rohingyan people so is the military. Military or Aun sang suki are no better than other when it come to atrocities against the Rohingya people, presently they are both using Rohingya as a political benefit as the wold has support for Rohingya."

She provided 100% cover to Military and downplayed the most brutal Massacre where Women and Children were burned alive.
Myanmar need Democracy under a new Democratic and Just leader Not Murderer Aung San Suu"
James Thomas Htun Kyaw,"The way Rohingyas show solidarity tell that Burmese people are united by culture. We may not share similar feelings, but you must remember, Myanmar has been a multi-ethnic country. The military, unfortunately, betrayed Aung San's ideals of multi-ethnic federal state and is now imposing back the centralisation and a constitution that empowers the army rather than civilians. Then we also have problems from the north, too, where our big neighbor doesn't want us to live in peace."

Uncle Chinsyou,"Myanmar has been suffering for centuries; first under British Colonialism, when the nation was placed inside Greater India, thus around 8 millions immigrants moved into small homogeneous country in long Colonial era; secondly through boycotted by the West, as impoverished Myanmar turned to Socialism for a relief. In fact, Myanmar has a sad saying that goes 'A poor young girl got raped and get hurt twice', referring to their nation's double tragedies. This on going crisis in Myanmar is product of Colonialism, when the nation was placed inside Greater India, thus around 8 millions immigrants poured into small homogeneous country in long Colonial era, including Rohingya Bengalis from populous but tiny Bangladesh which has a population of 170 million, that had been sending millions of illegal immigrants into Myanmar for ages that Myanmar has declared national emergency in Rakhine State ever since early 1980s, but Western news medias ignored it all, as Myanmar had been boycotted by the West, when impoverished country turned to Socialism after long painful Colonial era; and as a result, hardly any one out of Myanmar knew truths. It's all about Colonial masters & their South Asians they used as soldiers & servants to defend Colonial Empire worldwide, while master extracted wealth for centuries; and territorial expansion into next door Myanmar through immigration, which eventually end up a small homogeneous country, paying ultimate prices. Myanmar endured the worst immigration onslaught under long & painful Colonialism, when several million immigrants poured in, as small homogeneous country was put inside Greater India; while neighbors such as Laos, Cambodia & Vietnam under French Colonialism had no immigration issue at all. Like I said, there's hardly any Muslim, Hindu or Christian in Myanmar up until Colonialism, when the small homogeneous country was placed inside Greater India, and several millions South Asian immigrants poured in; while neighbors such as Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam under French Colonialism had no immigration issue at all.

Hallow, we have more than one million Indian people working in our country Bangladesh.... And we can identify them so easily. Kuch to sharam karo ye sab bolne se pehle.
Its true during 1971 and after that many Bangladeshi people migrated in India but many many Indians have migrated in Bangladesh also.
So stop spreading one sided view of your own. In border area it always  happens but now a days no Bangladeshi is migrating in India. They live a very happy life in Bangladesh.

ام احمد,"This video is old, but today I saw behind you in you, you are just an agent and mercenary agent from the government of Myanmar and defend it without the truth and you are not a definition of Rohingya history and its glory because we are from the original inhabitants of Arakan for thousands of centuries and our ancestors were of Hinduism and descendants a people  (Ariana ) and after the religion of Islam came, we embraced the doctrine of Islam 1440 years ago, (alhamdu lillah) we were peacefully living in each other (Muslim and Rakhine Mugh) and in 1484 AD and invaded and occupied the King of Burma (in Dubia) greed for Arakan's wealth because it is full of rivers 7 torments and the seashore bay with a transit  And the sea port of agricultural resources, breathtaking views, and the Amazon in Talal Hamalia, mineral, gases, petroleum and their agonies, and after the number of wars they killed and usurped thousands and after those who remained forced and displaced the Muslims and Rakhineh (Mog) who stayed to bangal( India )and after the occupation they returned to the Arakan this period  The role of (doush) after a British occupation came. We were a follower of British rule. 
As for what about the Muslims of Myanmar, do they see Arakan all over Myanmar?  And you don't know what happened in the capital Rangoon and Mandalay in 1912 (Indian)muslin schools and mosques were burnt and they are not Rohingya muslins !  And the second behavior that corruption erupted due to some Rohingya youth raped a Buddhist girl. This is a great accusation, and it is a shame for the truth because the Myanmar government made an anti-Rohnji film because the evidence and evidence is very clear that before the incident, the President of Myanmar (Tin Sen) Rohingy declared that he is not a citizen of Myanmar and  They deported them to other countries who love them!  In 2011 and a year later, with a bloody and bloody plan, the ten killings of Muslims were reported, and they have nothing to do with politicians, and lastly, I ask you to inform the Rohingya history and do not defend the murderer and criminal the fascist dictator so that you are not criminals,

Jesus is Lord,"The Gospel is the good news! And that good news is, Jesus died on the cross and rose from the dead, on the 3rd day. 
By Grace alone...faith alone...threw Christ alone. Christ shed his blood to cover our sins to make us clean. We're all sinners in a need of a savior. Hell  is real and you DON'T want to spend eternal there. 


Don't delay. Please wake from your worldly slumber. Take a moment to look around not just in your local area, but all over the world. So many events in scripture is happening before our eyes; these events all over, are impossible to ignore; please take the time to research and discern for yourself that we are INDEED in the end of times, the end of grace. Please except Jesus Christ as your Lord and savior while it's a gift of grace of faith alone. Please don't be the one who needs to see his presence/return to accept him. 
It's not to late, but the time is running out for the church rapture, and the events to come, as stated in the Bible. We all sin, and we sin differently than others, However we all my MUST repent the same and accept him the same. Build that relationship with God & Jesus as they're your ONLY FiRST love. Society has condemned those who struggle if they're or not good enough to enter the kingdom of heaven. God & Jesus love you so much and is waiting for that relationship, to have eternal life with you. Just by faith alone. Jesus paid that ultimate sacrifice, (willingly) and is waiting. Just take a moment to just think about it. May God bless and keep you! "

I recalled the ""Room"" of the movie.  I think that just only being born in a closed space is not unhappy for the child.  As long as there is a realistic hope of going out someday.  The right to abortion of a raped woman is claimed loudly, but the movie reminds me of the ""Annunciation"" painting, which makes me realize the preciousness of giving birth.
The case that became the subject is disgusting.  And I do not think that abortion is absolutely unacceptable, but I do not want to forget that the existence of children is a hope of living.  Feeling from the ""Annunciation"" painting."

Uday Sheorey,"Inder Mehta (newsreader) you must display a sticker ""presstitute"" proudly on your forehead. Do  you have no self-esteem that you read out such biased news for your paymasters?"
Uday Sheorey,"The Myanmar govt. appears to be too meek. It should forthwith declare that islam is not a religion, it never was. Islam was conjured up by a desperate warlord as a neo-political, viscious, hateful, violence-inciting cult, to collect together a bunch of looters, murders and rapists; then he craftily garbed it as a religion, with no exit option. Read the history for yourself, evaluate the facts and connect the dots (if you have an open mind on the subject); don't rely on the falsehoods propagated by imams and maulvis to shield their own agenda from scrutiny. You will come to the inevitable conclusion that the root-cause of the problem is the hateful & violence-inciting koran and the hadiths."
Ram deshpande,Myanmar need to be boycott by world till true democratic government form..
7 years and,what was the point of creating bangladesh . if they want to live in India ? Britian divided and allocated land based on  people's religion . now that demography is changed in north east due to uncontrolled infiltration . there are more than 20 million bangaldeshi in India . any one can get fake voter ID 's in India  for 400 rupees. Is India best place for more and more people ? here people are already suffering from over population and lack of infrastructure . BBC should report on problem of over population . also when some one is detained he must have committed some serious crime . otherwise why only 2000 people in jail not the 4 million who are not in NRC  list.. This is why BBC news is biased .you make news based only on one side to fulfill your own agenda . I agree to the people who commented here . Also I can see BBC smartness to film the bangladesh issue on a Hindu detainee guy to invoke  sentiments of the majority people . very pathetic when media 's work  only for propaganda

အုပ်စိုးပိုင် ၉ၐဲ-ၐဴ၅,This young lady has absolutely no idea of what's actually behind all this.
Jayde Moe,"The talk was pretty convincing. It is easier said then done in reality but it is a good start to lay possible solutions on the ground. Unfortunately, the strength and passion that you carried out was pampered by a lack of legitimacy in examples you have drawn: Aung San Su Kyi being the president, when in fact, she merely is a Democratic leader in the country and her actions are still restricted under previously laid out political constitution by the militant government over five decades. It is easier to point fingers and blame which side is wrong and which side it right, but population increase in Muslim minorities of northern Rakhine state have been a pressing concern the local Buddhist community residing within. Perceived fear of the size of a growing population of the Muslim minority have clearly raised concerns to the Buddhist majority. If you dig a little deeper to the facts, you will also learn people of different religions and chinese and immigrants of other descends are peacefully living next to each other in the major cities like Yangon and Mandalay in Myanmar. There will be people with there is only one best religion belief in society and there are people who embrace the diversity and commonly shared history. To reconcile these people together, people will have to discard those lens of religion and start planting seeds of humanity and love despite differences in skin color and belief systems. With a pressing concern about ISIS attacks, the world seems to have stepped back in accepting and integrating Muslims into the society in fear of compromising a status quo in the future. I hope hatred is not a way to incite people to act and I hope hatred does not resort to any further destruction in our world. I am expecting UN to place a pressure over Myanmar government to carry out remedial efforts for this influx of people and also am hoping the world see this matter not just from a perspective of the suffering body of Rohingya, but also of the Myanmar people, who may just have been acting in response to their fear of losing their hard-earned, newly-transitioned society and to racial propagandas raised by head military influencers."
Debjouti Dip,ur info regarding rohingya s living in border seems to be wrong. Bangladesh has received almost 100000 rohingyas. and feeding them for almost more then a year now though they hardly manage to feed there own people properly. and though united nations has ordered myanmar has to take them back. but they don't want to start the procedure.

How is the person who has no control over what is done by the military answer for their actions. It doesn't add up. The atrocities committed by the army needs to be prosecuted to its full extent but there is need for constitutional change to make this possible. Why she continues to defend the army which she doesn't have constitutional control over is what I don't understand?? It's the whole country brought to ICJ but it's the army that should be answering that. Burma is still very much under the hands of the army and she is going along with its atrocities.

Not mass peoples involved in this killing  except some Devil disciples. No Muslim country killed infidels but some by name Muslim sometimes oppress Non-Muslim.What we see in whole world everywhere people converted into Islam & that's the problem of Devil disciples & they create nuisance  in the community to stop conversion."
Mr.klowor Asoy,"I just wonder, why every where in the world have one common problem. Moslm ppl.. 
im not saying myanmar soldier is right, i mean f**k those soldiers for killing women n children. 
But did you ever ask yourself why same problem diffrent country? Why when moeslm is minority in a country u will get oppressed and killed, when you re a majority, u oppressed and killed the minority religion. Or you just fight among yourself. Why other religion dont hv a big problem in other countries?? For example, moeslm is majority in middle east, and see how that end up. In indo, see how you oppress other religion and still want to make your own Moeslm country and kick all others out. In Thailand, u start a war in suratani. In philipines, u start a war in mindanao. In India the hindus hates you so much, in malaysia, anti terrorist carckdown every month, in myanmar u you want independence and the govrbmnt hate u so much, in european uk austila usa u guys start kilking innocent in the name of religion and now the western ppl start to  have islamophobia in africa you got bokoharam killing and kidnaping other religion women and children. In gaza u fight israel stab rocket and bomb somebody who is much stronger then you. And expect to win in the name of allah? 

I Dont want to start argument here. I despise violent and killing of all living things. Innocent or not killing is not right. 

Im sure you got an excuse for all the countries that hates you. But we dont need excuse and reason. Just stop the violent. Excuse and reason doesnt makes violent and killing is right. 

And think why we dont have budhistphobia or hinduphobia or christianphobia or catholicphobia or atheistphobia in this world. 

Peace and i love you guys and all living things. And yes i wouldnt even kill a rat. Only mosquito and cockroach perhaps."

Where the feck were you all? When the military (actually) oppressed and murdered tens of thousands of MUCH MORE DISTINCTIVE ETHNIC TRIBALS all across the country... Dear VICE, you really should LEARN about history of BURMA before you want to cover some pop-up topics. The way all of you western media portraying the beef-up elaborated stories you cant actually prove yet, that is effectively making all of the other prominent minorities/ethnics (who were under discriminations/ facing that your proposed cleansing for many decades and it is still happening today) resented your stand. Come on so-called friends, where were you? Our country is officially still brawling the civil war thats started since 1948. And nobody gave a shit about it... oh yea US supported arms and choppers to the military junta in 60s as China backed up the communists.... then they bombed these anti comm shells on the villages of Karen, Karenni, Kachin, Mon and several other smaller tribes.... the army burnt down whole regions... WHERE WERE YOUR FLiPPING LIPS that is now so sadly spouting out non-stop...? You were never really here with us all these times! now... you guys just showed up right in time.... perhaps you guys got some good sponsors from some middle east shitty rich thingy.... probably... I'm not joking about that, we are feeling and thinking that way right now.... it is you guys who are effectively raising the anti-muslim mindset within our people with your bias nonsense, ain't you?

Shahid Mushtaq,"Mayanmar Army are killing Kachin Christians Too in the region of Kachin. 
Rohingya are just fighting for rights in mayamar. 
The army is killing people of Kachin and they demand independence for Kachin.
After seeing the comments i see how West and Americans are ignorant and Hypocrites.
Find out about Kachin it is a Christian Majority region in Mayanmar and they are fighting For independence and find out how Army is killing Kachin Christians.  The Americans and west even don't know that there is also a Christian ethnic group in mayanmar who is being prosecuted.
Now what would you say about this.
Blaming a religion for violence is not good.
I personally support all the minorities living under suppression and Occupation. 
You are blaming islam for voilence read the history and find out where does this terrorism first started.
They USA the Russia wanted control in world and destroyed poor nations.
But they got BLOWBACK in muslim nation.
Now tell me who started this who started Afghan war later where Al- qeada started.
Who funded them at the first place.
Who destroyed Iraq, Vietnam, syria.
Looks like American schools are not teaching you well.
You know  what we are now used to this calling us terrorist is not hurting us more."
Tobek,After that video I think Im rich
ravenshireful,This is perfect video showing western ignorance about islam.

Kaladan Valleys,"Actually Rohingyas are not people of Myanmar. They are people of Arakan state which was once an independent country and one of the largest rice exporter in southeast Asia. Arakan was one of the earliest Indianized kingdoms in southeast Asia. The Rohingya are descendants of the people of ancient Wethali (Veshali) kingdom of Arakan. Burma conquered Arakan in 1784 and killed millions of Arakanese people. Seven million Arakanese people killed  during occupation of and more were killed in different times after that. In the 10th century, the Rakkhines entered Arakan and killed the entire people of Waithali kingdom. Rohingya are people of Indo-Aryan origins having mixed blood of Arabs, Persians, Moghuls, Pathans and Bengalis.  they are the first inhabitants of Arakan and the Rakhines and Burmese entered Arakan after 10tth century. Rohingyas do not want to be ruled by Burma. Rohingyas have become a minority people from a nation in the hands of Burmese. Rohingyas want justice and their once an independent Arakan back which has been occupied by the Burma's Konbaung dynasty killing millions.

reported as an outrage, how dare they reciprocate, and not just lay down and accept
their fate."
KByville Pika,"I'm utterly disgusted by the comments here!
You people are the lowest forms of life on earth for being extremely hateful, Islamophobic and Brutal in a situation that you have no idea whatsoever. The Rohingya have been denied the rights that almost all human beings have of education, healthcare and movement etc and still you falsely accuse them of being Jihadists and Militants? The Rohingya have been living in the Rakhine state for centuries and their ethnicity + language are associated with that area, infact THEIR land has been confiscated by the corrupt burma Army. You don't know when evil dictators will exclude you from being a part of a country, it can be anyone. Just because they don't look Buddhist doesn't mean they don't belong there.

And about the Rohingya militant insurgency of resistance, when you treat people like animals sooner or later they'll start to behave like animals, some of them.

I'm glad about one thing, Hate destroys a person eventually and I hope you people in the comment section suffer from that fate very soon.

Genocides are very expensive. Other then boycotts and sanctions they have no idea what kind of economic demands China and Russia will make for its support. They will end up paying for decades.

 Afghanistan was also once Buddhist and this morning an illegal immigrant from Afghanistan murdered two women from Syria. He's now been ethnicaly cleansed from his home village Solihull Birmingham, his peace loving home, having to hide somewhere from the brutal regime of the British Police

This is a warning of how it could be if Islamic S Muslims ever win, the more extreme Muslims will just move on from murdering disbelievers (other faiths) to murdering less extreme Muslims

Where is UN calling for Islamic S to be put on trial for war crimes?

Sidhesh Patil,"Before you could answer the question of liability, whether it rests upon the state or individual/s, it is absolutely important to answer the question of control & relief.

a.) What has been done by the state to avoid further damage to the minority Rohingyas?

b.) What interim relief has been made available by the state to those affected?

On the issue of whether or not it is a case of genocide:

For mass killings to be referred to as a genocide (motion of the state), it is needs to be proven that the person/s who carried out the killings were simply the bearers of the intentions of the broader state. That, by questioning the response of the state to the incident in retrospective and as of date.  

If the answers to a.) & b.) is not reasonable, it ought to be genocide.

If those who carried out the execution are roaming freely, it ought be a case of genocide.

If those who carried out the execution received any reward (tangible/intangible) from the state, it ought to be a genocide."

Personally, i cant really blame both Myanmar defense army who only protecting Myanmar sovereign and Rohingya freedom fighter who fighting for their right to live and survive against extinction. In any conflicts, innocent life will be killed on both side in the crossfire. Both Myanmar defense army and Rohingya freedom fighter have their own motive and personal agenda which lead to these violence acts. There was a saying that 'Once innocent life is killed, it is as they killed all humanity', both Myanmar defense army and Rohingya freedom fighter did just that. I can only pray for the innocent life may their soul rest in peace and ask God for forgiveness to humanity...i can only hope both Myanmar and Rohingya, Muslim and Buddhist, to forgive themselves, stop this cycle of hatred and embrace each other as siblings in humanity..."

Hishamm Aezat,"We must be very careful when trusting a person who was brought up under military rule that they actually understand civil and human rights, and rule of law, before making them Nobel Peace Laureate.

Aung San Suu Kyi is powerless in a country still run by military rule.

For the past few years, Aung San has been downplaying a genocide that led an entire ethnicity to flee their country and calling it an internal conflict.

Aung San has been downplaying the numbers of Rohingya who fled their country.

Aung San has been downplaying the damages her armed forces have made to Rohingya's villages from burning them down to ashes, rape, murder and torture.

Aung San has been promising investigations but how many of her armed forces and high-ranking officers have been actually tried and sentenced for their crimes or did they mostly get exonerated or pardoned?

Aung San isn't actually aware of the plight of her people.

Aung San fear the military of her country and has no power over them.

Aung San might actually be a conspirator in this in order for her to please the military generals and gain their trust to secure more her office and authority. Unfortunately this how things go in third world countries."

Hewlet p,"Gambia is being quite hypocritical and economic with the truth. Why didnt they file a law suit during the persecution of Yazidis in Syria and Iraq, the persecution of Christians in Egypt, the persecutions of 
minority groups in many muslim countries?
The world is currently facing an Immigration and multicultural problem. And this is the challenge china is currently facing in Xinjiang. It has initiated what it calls re-education or correction centers and describes the exercise as  as reformed integration.
India also just enacted a law, which grants automatic Indian citizenship to religious minorities fleeing persecution from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Jains, Parsis and Sikhs are included in this list. It calls the exercise war on illegal immigration in defending the new law.
Europe & many other countries too are currently undergoing a cultural problem brought about by foreign ideologies and cultures. The far right secured big wins in recent elections.
Colonization also played a role to the problems the world is facing now. People who ought to have been together were separated and those who should have living separately were also forced together. Such differences in ideology is what brought about the separation of India and Pakistan.
I therefore don't condemn Suu Kyi neither do I support her.  I condemn the hypocrites."

Hishamm Aezat,"We must be very careful when trusting a person who was brought up under military rule that they actually understand civil and human rights and make them Nobel Peace Laureate. Aung San Suu Kyi is powerless in a country still run by military rule.

For the past few years, Aung San has been downplaying a genocide that led an entire ethnicity to flee her country and call it an internal conflict.

Aung San has been downplaying the numbers of Rohingya who fled her country.

Aung San has been downplaying the damages her armed forces have made to Rohingya's villages from burning them down to ashes to rape, murder and torture.

Aung San has been promising investigations but how many of her armed forces and high-ranking officers have been actually tried and sentenced for their crimes or did they mostly get exonerated or pardoned?

Aung San isn't actually aware of the plight of her people.

Aung San fear the military of her country and has no power over them.

Aung San might actually be a conspirator in this in order for her to please the military generals and gain their trust to secure more her office and authority. Unfortunately this how things go in third world countries."

All people know how difficult to survive in foreign countries whenever if you are going to study and get into professional industry or to work at factory as workers.  If you to live in a foreign country, you have contributed as in money or skill.  No body will give you for free.  Additionally, immigrants are always not getting the same facilities as host country's citizen that is the fact.  So,  they have to accept it.  The most important thing is they must respect and to follow law. If they breaks they law, there is always a consequences. See,  what happened in UK and US in the last fews days,  how they handel the situation when someone hurts or kills the innocent citizens. There is no way to tolerance the brutally acts of illegal immigrants to our country."

They are without citizenship, work, home, land and education. We the Malaysians and some NGO's have been helping them to survive. We know our government also lend a helping hand discreetly because legally they are not citizens. I wish we could give them citizenships and absorb them into the community but the political opposition (DAP) is against it and will use this effort to accuse the Malaysian government of betraying the people.

People are afraid to share what they have with the understanding that the share will become smaller and not enough. This is a sentiment of greedy people, a sentiment based on fear and a sentiment of small minded and calculative people.To them they see the world only in numbers.I wish they could see past their fears and small mindedness and see that sharing is always better for everybody."

Roronoa Zoro,"Get your facts checked and make sure you expose those people trying to make money off the struggling nations (instead of spreading Fake News). Why isn't anyone & the UN betting an eye on those families in separate cages at the Mexican-US border? For once, big public gatherings in Myanmar that dont involve the military whipping out their guns. 

First of all, Aung San Su Kyi isnt the president of . Myanmar citizens barely have their rights. Theres barely any justice on the ground. How can a terrorized country be accused of committing genocide? How can Aung San Su Kyi, who doesnt have much power over the military party, to fix everything the other party does for hundreds of years since her father was assassinated? Her own law advisor was assassinated a few years ago (presumably by the military). 
In this Bengali (Rohingya) case: all the oppositions accusations to this Noble Peace Prize Winner are like  youre a surgeon, why dont you operate on yourself? Because she Cant ? Shes doing all she can for the terrorists & the victims from BOTH sides (Myanmar & Bangladesh). Myanmar took on many refugees and helped them. But, if the refugees get involved with terrorists and rape Myanmar women, the military would get involved and abuse their power to ""calm the riots"". ASSK has nothing to do with the decisions. And also, Religion has nothing to do with this. They had no proof that Buddhists committed this. That was also a publicity stunt the Bangladesh terrorists made in the earlier times of this case to deter the truth from coming out. 

Where was the world court when Myanmar people were the true victims of genocides and injustice?

Firstly , Rakhine {Arakan} buddhist kingdom 3325 BC to 1784AD  and dynasties of four period and ruling times 5108 and kings 249 in Long history. There were no rohingya word. Rakhine written system was based on Brahmi +Nagari + traditional word+ sankriti +Pali. There were 3000 Arakan monks and 3000 Srilanka monks join first sangha conference at Vesali city in 638AD. There was another prove that portagul monk Sebastian Manrique who came to from Goa, South India in 1630, arrived at Mrauk -U city of Rakhine {Arakan} buddhist kingdom.the monk lived at city for five years and had experienced the coronation of the king in 1634-1635. After returning to his homeland ,He recorded ""The coronation of The king Thi Ri Thuddmma"" . He mentioned about Arakan kingdom in detain. Here are a few of them. He mentioned that the king took coronation after 12 year due to omen and the diamond clown of king was from Taunggoo kingdom,about 12 princes coroned before king.about king of 32 military elephants, Army 200 military elephants and 100 in two line elephants and many  horse forces and dancing and singing youth women between elephants and musicians, 3 house forces under the army ,1, mahameddin mughal house  forces  green men 600 with bow and arrow on white Arabia houses,2,Pegu forces purple men 800 holding swords and 17207inch Shields on black houses ,3, Tuaung goo forces men,wearing bamboo hats with short spears and knife holding colourful flags on houses and about culture and food and trading and many foreigners at city and were residential Houses of Dutch, Portuguese, and others were danish, Persia,Arabs, chinese, indian, srilanka,coching hona{Thai} kmer,mon, muttama,havaee, and Japanese, Viet, .But where were your bangali, or Rohingya name there? There were other books ""finishing kingdom""the Golden Mrauk-U"" the coils of Dr forchermer and ""the Arakan history"" by Dr San shew Bu and more but where were your Rohingya name? That is pretty funny things."

Hasan Imam,"firstly, I believe most of the Rohingyas aged less than 60 years and most of them are born in Myanrmar. This is the birth right of most of the Rohingyas to be considered as Myanmar Citizen, not immigrant.

Hence, if Rohingyas need to be return to homeland, then it should be either a) India b) UK because Bangladesh born in just 1971 only."

The Myanmarese Buddhists are very peace loving and under normal circumstances, they would never do such acts of violence.
The Rohingya Muslims originally came from Bangladesh. They started growing in size. Once they achieved a sizeable population, they started attacking the Buddhists and started their agenda  of spreading Islam, which pushed the peaceful  Buddhists to this extent
The media is not looking or trying to analyse the root cause, but showing only 1 side of the story

We in India really do not endorse the violence and killing of people of any religion."

Why they do that so there is nothing strange about police beat them back. Myanmar is a peaceful and free religion country. Welcome to Myanmar you all come and see and then you will see how Muslims, Christian, and Buddhism living peacefully in cities. I have Muslim friends, girls, and boys. One of my Muslim friends is my girl best friend. She is friendly to me and also I'm friendly to her. even those problem in Rakhine we still best friends .there is no problem. all of you guys misunderstanding on Myanmar. Truth has two faces.

Offer to help the 2 border countries with something they lack for a number of years in exchange for allowing the R to live autonomously in the border lands.

Sahih Bukhari (52:177) - Allah's Apostle said, ""The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. ""O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him."" 

Quran (9:5) - ""So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captive and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them."" 

Hadith 9:4 ""Wherever you find infidels kill them; for whoever kills them shall have reward on the Day of Resurrection.""

Quran (2:244) - ""Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things."" 

Quran (4:74) - ""Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward."" 

Quran (4:76) - ""Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah""

Quran (4:89) - ""They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks.""

They will deservedly and once again be the most powerful nation the world had ever seen.

The UN has eerily similar statements made about the Palestinians. One of the worst cases of oppression since WWII

Pakistan may be put into a corner and silenced out of fear or greed but at least they do not pick and choose which people are worth saving from persecution and which you should gleefully turn a blind eye too.

Almayra K,"I am from Srebrenica. I have a message for all of those in the comments that allow their emotion (which are justified) to overpower their reason.

I never met my grandfathers and two uncles, they were slaughtered. My mother tells me my grandfather used to carry us around as babies, but those few stories is all we have. Other uncles managed to survive the path trough the forest. My twin brother is deaf because of the war. I heard terrors from my other family that none of you can imagine. But we can still speak for ourselves.

We should be careful that our hurt does not go overboard. The person who really KNOWS a consequence of violence will always call for everything to avoid it again if they can.

The Serbs in Serbia were under so much intense propaganda. My family talks to me that some of their neighbours were telling them ""We cannot tell why, but you need to leave"" before the war. My mother took my brother to hospital during the war and she was driven by a Serb a part of the way. When she came there a nurse told to her ""you are slaughtering our children there"". My mother was ""What? All of the Serb women and children left because they knew what was coming"". 

I think the only way forward for us is communication. How can two people leave side by side for hundreds of years and do not know they worship the same God? How? They don't even know. Approach of let's live together and leave religion out of it obviously cannot work. The ignorance festers into hate. We need dialogue."

If we look closely at the history of Uyghurs, the period when the Han Chinese took over Uyghurs was only a small part of the entire Uyghur history. It is as if the Mongols remember the Yuan Dynasty and say that the present China belongs to Mongolia, and the history of China is included in the history of Mongolia. If Mongolia was a powerful country."

"xAle Jones lnformation war, war info for your mind","*Important, there is a genocide happening like during WW2.  Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and now they are doing it under the guise of a corona virus pandemic.*  Corona means crown, and a virus attacking the crown/government is some thing exposing government lies.(2Corinthians4:4).  Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 can only apply to one place on earth.  Research it well to learn who has been behind slaughters for centuries.  1John5:19 is trying to stop Daniel12:4,2:44,45.  Hitler was a Catholic and never excommunicated.  Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 is orchestrating this assault against humanity, but they are trying to blame it on innocent peoples, Countries and groups.  They are responsible for boycotts, civil disobedience, sabotage, and soon to be mass killings like against the Jews in Nazi Germany.  People were rounded up to go to concentration camps because of a supposed typhus epidemic, and were gassed on the way by vehicle exhaust, or later by zyklon B rodent extermination gas with the smell taken out (#%$&%$#$)cyanide.  Revelation mentions that people should leave the Revelation18:4 group if they don't want to receive her *plagues.  (Hello, if you don't want to receive her plagues!)*  According to Revelation 18 this group wears scarlet(Cardinals), and Purple(Bishops).  It refers to a city Kingdom (Rome is the only city kingdom in the world), that rules over the Kings of the earth.  Where are the Kings?  The Roman Empire broke in 2 and from those 2 divisions came 10 Countries.  5 Countries on each leg of the Roman Empire.  The (cross or X) is on the shields of the the Empire, and it symbolizes the ten Kingdoms, and the religious beliefs.  And through time nations and peoples have not been able to sell their goods to other nations with out this mark.  According to official writings no one may buy or sell or say a greeting to any one who has left the cross.  The X or cross originates from the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet the taw, which means a mark, both literal and figurative.  In The Bible book of Ezekiel, God put a taw(mark) on the people who were crying over the loss of wickedness.  The mark was not for salvation.  Revelation/Apocalypse 13:18 says you won't be able to buy or sell with out the taw(mark) of the beast(Empire).  The cross has been used through out history, including the Egyptians called it the anke, which was a symbol of power.  The cross has become associated with the Messiah(Christ), and that is where Xmass, and Christmas comes from.  Popes have always had a mitre(triple tiered crown) with 666 on it in Latin (Vicarivs Filli Dei).  Latin letters have a number associated with it, just like Hebrew and Greek.  Rome has called for mass destruction and sabotage to stop people from hearing this.  Government and Churches working together in self interest, not in the interest of the people.  The earth belong to the people collectively.  1John5:19 is getting people to attack the people trying to make you free.  *Clear your browser history and cache, and YouTube search and viewing history!  Please pray for me and you!*  God for warned about these things happening. 
The hate for Acts2:44 runs deep, and that is why Christian nations that are committing genocide under the guise of a corona virus, just as Hitler did under the guise of a typhus epidemic, are falsely attacking China saying that they are the ones committing genocide.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb-MNi8E-TA   The last war China fought was WW2, and that was because they were attacked.  Try reading your Bible and having a scrap of decency!   Muslim Countries have not condemned this because it is a fake, and a over for a WW2 like genocide happening.  Hitler exterminated under the guise of a typhus epidemic and now they are doing it under the guise of a corona virus pandemic. ;!(("

Sourish Halder,"Every country has Correctional Units/Centres for de-radicalization. Most of these are located inside prison complex, few of them have separately like China and Soviet Gulags. Similarly when PRC was established they also had a plan to combat counter-revolutionary extremism.

West needs some or the other party who oppose CCP to capitalize on their opposition for destabilizing China. Here they've found East Tusrkestan Islamic Party (ETIP) - an Islamic fundamentalist group which has an aim of separating Xinjiang from China and establish an Emirati or Caliphate system.

WS Chin,"If the story of China carrying out genocide on the minority Uyghurs is true, then why is it that over several years, the Uyghur population in Xinjiang has increased instead of decreased? If China actually wants to carry out genocide against a minority, then they they really need to take tutorial lessons on 'How to carry out genocide' from the  US since US are the champions at carrying out genocide of Muslim population in Middle East."

Patrick K,"Theres growing up in Africa, a generation which has no first-hand knowledge of colonial rule. These boys and girls, born since independence, will find it difficult to believe that there was a time when Africans could not walk in certain parts of every town, unless they had business there as servants. The limitations on our freedom, the crimes against our dignity as human beings, will seem to them remote and unreal.Its cheering to think that when they meet an European it will never occur to them to touch the imaginary forelock, or bow in servility, as some of our older Men still do, so hard is it to break long-established habits. The social effects of colonialism are more insidious than the political and economic. This is because they go deep into the minds of people and therefore take longer to eradicate. The Europeans relegated us to the position of inferiors in every aspect of our everyday life."

However this is by no means a solely Christian problem it is also happening in the Muslim, Jewish and Hindu worlds. Religious authorities of this day and age are not working for the Pleasure of God, they are working for a totally different agenda to God's, personal and economic gains are their motives. We are living, and have been for 100-200 years, in an age of deception."

Quran 9:123 ""O you who believe, fight those disbelievers who are near you, and let them find severity in you. Know well that Allah is with the God-fearing.""

Sahih al-Bukhari 6922 ""Some Zanadiqa (atheists) were brought to `Ali and he burnt them.

I would have killed them according to the statement of Allah's Messenger (), 'Whoever changed his Islamic religion, then kill him.'"""

Native American history after Columbus is absolutely tragic, and too many people dont see the extent of it. For example, the Tano peoples developed mass suicidal tendencies (e.g. mothers performing infanticide, men jumping off of cliffs, etc.) after endless mistreatment from the Spanish. Today, natives are still suffering from high rates of drug abuse, alcoholism, obesity, domestic violence, and sexual abuse. If you blame the natives themselves for these issues, you are highly ignorant. Who subjected them to slavery and destitution? Who forced them out of their homelands? Theres so much to native history that people arent aware of: the suffering, but also the sophistication of the cultures. It makes me very happy seeing these young natives reconnecting with their culturesalthough truthfully, they should never have been separated from them in the first place."

Bernardo chill,"The Canadian government said on Thursday it would direct more resources to First Nations police and address systemic racism in the justice system and law enforcement to tackle violence against Indigenous women, but gave no time frame for achieving its transformative changes.

The government promised to give Indigenous communities more control over some social services and improve access to healthcare. Its plan comes two years after a report into the deaths of more than 1,000 Indigenous women and girls in recent decades called it a national genocide.

The government said it would address systemic racism among the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the national law enforcement agency responsible for policing many rural areas in the country, through improved recruitment and training.

Ramneek Singh,This is exactly the case this interview exposes Pakistan's hypocrisy.
game.art 1200,I'm sick and tired of saying this to you dumb fools. Khan didn't condemn it cus he just wanted to there is alot of shit that goes behiend it. If khan did condemn China publicly then China will cut off all deals/supplies from Pakistan and considering Pakistan is run on 80% Chinese supplies the country will go bankrupt.
Y2K,he has kept quiet because of the financial impact this has. China owns Pakistan now. He is kissing his masters asses in China and Saudi Arabia
Osama Zahid,"As a Pakistani, let me tell you first hand why this hypocritical man is silent on Uyghur Muslims. 

It's because our economy runs on Chinese investment. China is like our spiritual father who spoon feeds Pakistan with cash in the form of investments. 

Dare our prime minister say anything against the Chinese government, we would be deprived and left bankrupt if China pulls out. 

Also, this hypocritical PM has an entirely corrupt cabinet. He's essentially a pupper who speaks on behalf of his masters. He'll speak about Kashmiri Muslims because of self-interest but won't condemn the situation in China, Syria, Iraq because that doesn't align with his interests. 

He's a hypocrite, a liar, and by far, one of the worst things to happen to Pakistan in recent times."

Bill Klien,"Is Pakistan only the Islamic country? Like I get it, I'm not a Pakistani nor do I know much about the east but I've been there and out of all of the ""Islamic"" countries, only Pakistan is doing everything for everyone. It's not like Pakistan is the most richest out of all of them but it's still trying to handle everything it can when it comes to Islam. Only Pakistan is the one Islamic country that stood for Gaza, Kashmir, Syria and even Afghanistan back in the day and they let people of Afghanistan live in Pakistan like one of them after helping them whilst not doing so well and being in a gigantic sea of debt and what did it got from the Afghans in return? A big F U, a huge kick in the balls and sided with their enemies. Pakistan is not even solving what's inside their country just so they can help the others in need and NONE of the ""other"" Islamic countries are doing a damn thing. Like why isn't Saudi Arabia doing anything about it? Why isn't UAE doing anything about it? And so on? Like if all of those so called ""Sheikh's"" who have teeth of golds came together and tried to solve these issues, I'm sure they have enough money to solve but they won't. Why? Because they are greedy degenerates. They rather reward those who do this to the Muslims. It's crazy that we Western people think that every ""Islamic"" situation is responsibility of Pakistan alone lol"

As muslims we know the the contract of misaq e madina . In which kufaar said we will not return anyone of you come to makka but you have to, Hazarat Muhammad PBUH accepted this condition but companions dont want but they saw the result after that . So the point of stating this example here is some time you have to step back for a moment to win . And politics is something different it doesnt follow the emotions ,the leaders make decisions for long time effect not instant,while making decisions their priority is larger group of people not smaller. And Im pretty he tried behind the door . He is loyal to ummah but he is bound in politics. 
P.s: Im not imran khan supporter Im just stating the facts as a pakistani, so if you dont agree dont create a fight in replies."

Hamza Sulaiman,"What a joke. I always wondered what Imran Khan response would be if someone was to ask him about the torture of Muslims in China. This just shows that as long as he's getting money, he'll let China do whatever they wants and to whoever they wants. I have no Respect for this Imran Khan anymore.
 
Before he talks about how western society sees Muslims after 9/11 and after the reporter asked him about the Muslims in China, his response completely changes and he started focuses on what's happening to Muslims in his border and he says he's focusing on what's happening in his country. He's just a puppet of China and can't say a word against them because they'll stop funding. Such a disgrace.

Hanwen Tan,"The following is what I borrowed from a Malaysian YouTubers comment:



Im from Malaysia. China has traded with Malaysia for 2000 years. In those years, they had been the worlds biggest powers many times. Never once they sent troops to take our land. Admiral Zhenghe came to Malacca five times, in gigantic fleets, and a flagship eight times the size of Christopher Columbus flagship, Santa Maria. He could have seized Malacca easily, but he did not. In 1511, the Portuguese came. In 1642, the Dutch came. In the 18th century the British came. We were colonised by each, one after another.



When China wanted spices from India, they traded with the Indians. When they wanted gems, they traded with the Persian. They didnt take lands. The only time China expanded beyond their current borders was in Yuan Dynasty, when Genghis and his descendants Ogedei Khan, Guyuk Khan & Kublai Khan concurred China, Mid Asia and Eastern Europe. But Yuan Dynasty, although being based in China, was a part of the Mongolian Empire. 



Then came the Century of Humiliation. Britain smuggled opium into China to dope the population, a strategy to turn the trade deficit around, after the British could not find enough silver to pay the Qing Dynasty in their tea and porcelain trades. After the opium warehouses were burned down and ports were closed by the Chinese in ordered to curb opium, the British started the Opium War I, which China lost. Hong Kong was forced to be surrendered to the British in a peace talk (Nanjing Treaty). The British owned 90% of the opium market in China, during that time, Queen Victoria was the worlds biggest drug baron. The remaining 10% was owned by American merchants from Boston. Many of Bostons institutions were built with profit from opium. 



After 12 years of Nanjing Treaty, the West started getting really really greedy. The British wanted the Qing government: 

1. To open the borders of China to allow goods coming in and out freely, and tax free. 

2. Make opium legal in China.

Insane requests, Qing government said no. The British and French (with supports from the US), started Opium War II with China, which again, China lost. The Anglo-French military raided the Summer Palace, and threatened to burn down the Imperial Palace, the Qing government was forced to pay with ports, free business zones, 300,000 kilograms of silver and Kowloon was taken. Since then, Chinas resources flew out freely through these business zones and ports. In the subsequent amendment to the treaties, Chinese people were sold overseas to serve as labor. 



In 1900, China suffered attacks by the 8-National Alliance (Empire of Japan, Russian Empire, British Empire (including India), France, USA, Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary). Innocent Chinese civilians in Peking (Beijing now) were murdered, buildings were destroyed & women were raped. The Imperial Palace was raided, and treasures ended up in museums like the British Museum in London and the Louvre in Paris. 



In late 1930s China was occupied by the Japanese in WWII. Millions of Chinese died during the occupancy. 300,000 Chinese died in Nanjing Massacre alone. 



Mao brought China together again from the shambles. There were peace and unity for some time. But Maos later reign saw sufferings and deaths from famine and power struggles. 



Then came Deng Xiao Ping and his infamous black-cat and white-cat story. His preference in pragmatism than ideologies has transformed China. This thinking allowed China to evolve all the time to adapt to the actual needs in the country, instead of rigidly bounded to ideologies. It also signified the death of Communism in actually practice in China. The current Socialism+Meritocracy+Market Economy model fits the Chinese like gloves, and it propels the uprise of China. Singapore has a similar model, and has been arguably more successful than Hong Kong, because Hong Kong being gateway to China, was riding on the economic boom in China, while Singapore had no one to gain from.



In just 30 years, the CPC have moved 800 millions of people out from poverty. The rate of growth is unprecedented in human history. They have built the biggest mobile network, by far the biggest high speed rail network in the world, and they have become a behemoth in infrastructure. They made a fishing village called Shenzhen into the worlds second largest technological centre after the Silicon Valley. They are growing into a technological power house. It has the most elaborate e-commerce and cashless payment system in the world. They have launched exploration to Mars. The Chinese are living a good life and China has become one of the safest countries in the world. The level of patriotism in the country has reached an unprecedented height. 



For all of the achievements, the West has nothing good to say about it. China suffers from intense anti-China propagandas from the West. Western Media used the keyword Communist to instil fear and hatred towards China. 

Everything China does is negatively reported. 



They claimed China used slave labor in making iPhones. The truth was, Apple was the most profitable company in the world, it took most of the profit, leave some to Foxconn (a Taiwanese company) and little to the labor. 



They claimed China was inhuman with one-child policy. At the same time, they accused China of polluting the earth with its huge population. The fact is the Chinese consume just 30% of energy per capita compared to the US. 



They claimed China underwent ethnic cleansing in Xinjiang. The fact is China has a policy which priorities ethnic minorities. For a long time, the ethnic minorities were allowed to have two children and the majority Han only allowed one. The minorities are allowed a lower score for university intakes. There are 39,000 mosque in China, and 2100 in the US. China has about 3 times more mosque per muslim than the US. 

When terrorist attacks happened in Xinjiang, China had two choices:

1. Re-educate the Uighur extremists before they turned terrorists.

2. Let them be, after they launch attacks and killed innocent people, bomb their homes. 

China chose 1 to solve problem from the root and not to do killing. How the US solve terrorism? Fire missiles from battleships, drop bombs from the sky. 



During the pandemic, 

When China took extreme measures to lockdown the people, they were accused of being inhuman.

When China recovered swiftly because of the extreme measures, they were accused of lying about the actual numbers.

When Chinas cases became so low that they could provide medical support to other countries, they were accused of politically motivated. 

Western Media always have reasons to bash China. 



Just like any country, there are irresponsible individuals from China which do bad and dirty things, but the China government overall has done very well. But I hear this comment over and over by people from the West: I like Chinese people, but the CPC is evil. What they really want is the Chinese to change the government, because the current one is too good. 



Fortunately China is not a multi-party democratic country, otherwise the opposition party in China will be supported by notorious NGOs (Non-Government Organization) of the USA, like the NED (National Endowment for Democracy), to topple the ruling party. The US and the British couldnt crack Mainland China, so they work on Hong Kong. Of all the ex-British colonial countries, only the Hong Kongers were offered BNOs by the British. Because the UK would like the Hong Kongers to think they are British citizens, not Chinese. A divide-and-conquer strategy, which they often used in Color Revolutions around the world. 



They resort to low dirty tricks like detaining Huaweis CFO & banning Huawei. They raised a silly trade war which benefits no one. Trade deficit always exist between a developing and a developed country. USA is like a luxury car seller who ask a farmer: why am I always buying your vegetables and you havent bought any of my cars? 



When the Chinese were making socks for the world 30 years ago, the world let it be. But when Chinese started to make high technology products, like Huawei and DJI, it caused red-alert. Because when Western and Japanese products are equal to Chinese in technologies, they could never match the Chinese in prices. First world countries want China to continue in making socks. Instead of stepping up themselves, they want to pull China down. 



The recent movement by the US against China has a very important background. When Libya, Iran, and China decided to ditch the US dollar in oil trades, Gaddafis was killed by the US, Iran was being sanctioned by the US, and now its Chinas turn. The US has been printing money out of nothing. The only reason why the US Dollar is still widely accepted, is because its the only currency which oil is allowed to be traded with. The US has an agreement with Saudi that oil must be traded in US dollar ONLY. Without the petrol-dollar status, the US dollars will sink, and America will fall. Therefore anyone trying to disobey this order will be eliminated. China will soon use a gold-backed crypto-currency, the alarms in the White House go off like mad.



Chinas achievement has been by hard work. Not by looting the world.



I have deep sympathy for China for all the suffering, but now I feel happy for them. China is not rising, they are going back to where they belong. Good luck China."

The population of the Muslim population in the Zinquang is actually increasing, contrary to the claims of genocide."
Yang Zhenjen,"By Ehab Bayoumi on US/Canada/Dutch declaration of genocide in Xinjiang.

Ehab completely exposed the nature of the US/Anglos beast:

I'm an ex-Muslim from Egypt but let's pretend for the purposes of this question that I'm still Muslim. Also thislll be long, sorry, but bear with me.

Right now about 4 or 5 million people in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and East Jerusalem are living under a 50-year-old Israeli occupation with blatantly inferior rights and in circumstances unsuitable for human life, which are quite explicitly designed to drive them out and replace them with foreign settlers.
Response from the Western world: Coddling up to Netanyahu's far-right government and ignoring and even cracking down on all domestic protest (BDS, anti-Israel activities at Western universities, etc.).

In 2003 Iraq, which was a functional state even after 10 years of US sanctions, was brutally invaded and its army, police, government, and ruling party dismantled in a matter of months, based on accusations of nuclear weapons and terrorist links which proved to be false. Iraq then experienced the bloodiest civil war of its history, not to mention the rise of ISIS. The death toll runs at least into the hundreds of thousands.
Response from the Western world: All is forgotten.

Right now Iran is suffering from the most brutal sanctions suffered by any nation in history (even worse than the ones applied to apartheid South Africa). Several Western countries have cut off diplomatic relations. Iran can't sell its oil, its currency is now worthless, it's cut off from the global financial system, it couldn't even access a World Bank loan to help it deal with coronavirus, and even international children's charities in it aren't allowed to hand out cash donations anymore, only food packages. You can't even send a letter to Iran right now. This is based on accusations of an illegal nuclear weapons program, accusations which are not supported by any evidence (remember Iraq?).
Response from the Western world: Totally ignored.

NATO bombed and destroyed the Libyan state of Muammar Al-Gaddafi based on accusations that he, among other things, was using a mercenary African army and even jet bombers against peaceful protesters. These accusations turned out to be false and now Libya has been at civil war for 10 years.
Response from the Western world: All is forgotten.

The Communist government of Afghanistan enlisted Soviet help against armed Islamic extremists. The US happily swooped in and turned those Taleban extremists into a proper army with funding, weapons, and political backing. 15,000 Soviets died, the Soviets pulled out, the Afghan government collapsed, a civil war happened, the Taleban seized power and ruled for a decade and turned the country back to the Stone Age.
Response from the Western world: All is forgotten.

Nobody in the Western world ever bore responsibility for these atrocities. No one was tried for war crimes, no politician even lost his office, not a penny was sent to these countries as compensation. Hell, until now there hasn't even been an official acknowledgement of wrongdoing. In fact the West has the nerve to complain about these countries producing refugees after it destroyed them.

Now the main point

There's supposedly an anti-Muslim genocide going on in China's Xinjiang. Despite the allegation of millions of Muslims being imprisoned, beaten, raped and tortured, there is no objective evidence of even one concentration camp or one death.
But here the Western world (US, Canada, Australia, Britain, EU) is suddenly extremely involved. It's denouncing and even insulting China every day. Every politician and every news organization is doing it. It's recognized the matter as genocide, it's giving money and political backing to Muslim separatist groups, it's shutting down Chinese institutions and sanctioning Chinese corporations, and it's trying to isolate China economically and diplomatically.

Muslim nations talked to China and sent observers to Xinjiang. They decided nothing was going on. But the Western world is being extra vigilant. Its conscience just can't rest. Suddenly it loves Muslims so much that even when they say they're not being oppressed, it still says they're being oppressed.

Huh? Why's the response so different this time? Why does the West suddenly care so much about Muslim suffering? The West really loves oppressed Uyghurs, but shows no such concern for Libyans, Syrians, Palestinians, Afghans, Iraqis or Iranians.

You might have a very poor image of Muslims, you might think they're all idiots. But I assure you they're not too stupid to see that the West is trying to enlist Muslim allies in a smear campaign and economic war against its #1 rival and only non-Western rising superpower, based on bogus horror-claims and a pretence of humanitarianism.

And what better way to weaken both China and Muslims?

The West is turning for help to the very same Muslim countries it wrecked, and whose problems it otherwise totally ignores. But the Muslim world will never turn its back on a great power that has always shown it respect and friendship, to prostitute itself to a Western world which offers only arrogance, violence, neocolonialism, chaos and death.

It's just not gonna happen, the Muslims aren't buying it. Trust me I know we're not the most educated, enlightened, logical population (you might even call us barbarians), but we are just not that dumb. We know true friends from lying backstabbers."

The West  should humbly learn from China by adopting favourable ethnic policies towards people of  minorities( including Urighurs,Tibetans,

Mongolians & etc in China ) by making them easier to make good living in China. Also the West should learn from China by allowing minorities to establish autonomous provinces and regions( including Xinjiang, Tibet, inner Mongolia, HongKong, Macau & etc) to run their own Government ! 

I wonder there are any autonomous states or provinces in USA and the five eyes' nations being run  by native people within their own inherited ancestral states and provinces??  So don't be hypocritical just criticize other countries but themselves done nothing good to minorities!!! In fact most people of minorities in China have better living conditions than those natives in USA or the 5 eyes immigrants nations. However, the West never has such favourable ethnic  policies towards minorities living within USA or the five eyes nations instead just keep discrediting/ demonizing China or other countries but themselves done  nothing good to minorities people  so as to make them feel great or supreme than others!  Those keep fabricating fake news to discredit other countries are Really devils and will surely  be punished by God to hell soonest!

 US police kill black, natives, color people at higher rates than US murder rate.  More than 28 per cent US police killings were black, natives or color  Americans despite blacks, natives and color  accounts for 13 per cent of US population.  Just in 2020, US had 592 mass shootings and 41509 people got killed which means  in average 119 people got killed a day ! Blacks, natives and color people were 3 times likely to be killed by US police.  One in four young  Native or Asian Americans had been target of racial bullying. People of blacks,  native and color account for two thirds of all US imprisoned minors.  During most current pandemic period, more than half million Americans died of Coronavirus due to US govt mishandling of Covid19,  blacks, natives and color   made up 25 per cent of all Covid19 deaths when blacks, natives and color  just accounts for 13 per cent of US population. 
Money tainted  US politics  distorted and suppressed public opinion turning elections into one or two men show of wealthy class just for purpose of selecting an old Grandpa president with age over 78 which means  most young Americans are becoming less  competent  in the world including competing  for this local US president  post!!!

Witch-King,"Is Hinduism a peaceful religion?
When a man was lynched on rumors that he ate beef, a magazine belonging to Hindu terror outfit justified the killing by saying that Vedas say kill those who slaughter cows. Whether Hinduism is peaceful or violent can be gauged from the fact on how it treats its own Shudras leave aside what it says about other religions, every 18 minutes a crime is committed against a Dalit and all these has scriptural sanction. Some Hindus also say that Hindus dont use verses from their scripture to justify killing of non-Hindus

Lets take a look  

Brahma Purana 106.121 There is a hell named Gudapaka. It is full of boiling eddies of treacle and molasses. A man responsible for mixture in castes is thrown into it. He is burnt therein.

Yajur Veda 13.12
O king, make progress in thy duty of administration, extend happiness to the virtuous. O terrible chastiser, burn down the irreligious foes. O splendid person, humiliate and consume utterly like dried up stubble, him, who encourages our foe.
Atharva Veda 12.5.62

Rend, rend to bits, rend through and through, scorch and consume and burn to dust, the one who rejects the Vedas
Atharva Veda 12.2.23

He who dwells fixed in the atmosphere, smiting the blasphemers of the god that do not sacrifice to him be reverence with ten Sakvari-stanzas.

Spread the message about the evil of Hinduism!"

In Hungary there was segregation on Gypsies from 2004 and ended by judge decision in 2020..
And I think the victory of gypsies was because some of them fought by law and some psychically fought, like attacking authorities (police etc).. They used some how slicing strategy and it worked.. because racist commie left-right wings preferred the justice ""by law""..
And UN (Swedish Ombudsman to Hungary) just started appearing on Gypsies side..

But how many muslims have openly condemned the killing of security forces either in J and K or stone pelting on the medics in many places or the hate spread by some Mullahs against Hindus ? How many of you have openly come out, protested on the streets or wrote editorials or commented on news channels? Hate was sown by whom? I still see many Muslim leaders coming on news channels and defending the actions of their people. Is it acceptable.  Peace can prevail only if all agree to abide by the rules laid by government.

Shanto Antony,"Ill Tell What Is Happening

Indian Hindus Are Shifting Out Of India Which Leads To The Decrease in Population Of Hindus In India, And  In Major States Hindu's Are Converting Thier Religion, As Per Data Per 3 Hindu Convertors 2 Are Converted Into Muslim And 1 To Other Religion
But In North Hindus Are Dominating The Land By More Population Then Other Religion Still The Population Of Hindu Has Been Decreased If We See According To The Population Of India 
Hindu Population Data:
1947 : 89% 
1964 : 84%
2010:  81% 
2019 : 72% ( The Population Of Hindus Has Been Drastically Fell Down Between 2010/2019

 

And Muslims From Arab's And Middle East Is Shifting To India Manly To Kerala Which Whill Lead The Population Of Muslims In India 
And Now As From Indian Law Per Couple Should Have 2/3 Childrens But For This, Muslims Male's Are Marrying 2/3 Wifes But Now Its Decreasing In India, Now Muslim Male's  Can Only Marry A Single Woman, But Still There Population Is Growing Faster Than Hindus And Christians, And Now The Muslims Have 39% Populations Of India, According To The Indian Population Data, Till 2050 The Population Of Muslims Will Be Around 44% And Other 56% Will Be Other Religion Including Hindu And Christian


About Christians, There Majority Poplulation Is Increasing But Not At That Much Speed Of Hindus Or Muslims 
But According To Data 20% Christians Are Converted Of Other Religion Mainly From North States,
And The Same Goes For Christians, Many Youth Christians Are Shifting To Western Countries


So My Dear Hindu Friend We Are Dumb We Should Have Faith In Our Religion, Its Not Muslim's Fault That They Are Increasing In Population Then Hindu

Thats It , No Hate Thank You"

The reporter deliberately dramatized this video beginning with the background music then using a concealed camera for some shots when I have seen numerous other Vblogers openly using their cameras without issues in Xinjiang. Hardly surprising security is tight and there is a airport like security check point entering the Urumqi markets, its for public safety following a string of terrorist attacks in the city.. Again understand if a young foreign woman is wandering around at night talking to local men it causes suspicion, is she a drug customer or a prostitute?  We are often reminded to report suspicious activities. Then she is lying to the police about being a reporter. Later the video chops to Istanbul. and the blue East Turkistan flag. The flag of the terrorist organisation  ETIM.  Uyghur separatists who fight along side ISIS and AlQaeda in Syria and Afghanistan with intentions of returning to Xinjiang and creating a ISIS style caliphate. Dont buy the propaganda, do your own research."

V Lau,"Human rights issue in Xinjiang - horrific crimes against Uyghurs and even genocides, what? Here are the hard facts that I believe, and not biased rhetorics and propaganda. Don't fall for it again like the rhetoric about having weapons for mass destruction in Iraq. The ensuing invasion of Iraq was the real cause of the humanitarian issues and horrific crimes against Iraqis. In the most recent UN General Assembly sessions on human rights discussion, 62 countries signed a joint statement supporting China. Together with other countries deliberating at the UN sessions, there were over 100 countries on Chinas side. This is compared to just 43 countries including the US and its western allies, who are alleging human rights abuse on the Uyghurs (Muslim ethnic minority) in Xinjiang. There is one critical fact that is often overlooked - none of these 43 countries is a Muslim country. On the contrary, there are many Muslim countries supporting China. Between 2010 to 2018, the Uyghur population grew from 10.2 m to 12.7 m (much faster than Hans 8.8m to 9.0m). Between 2010 to 2019, Xinjiangs GDP grew close to 3 times from RMB 542 billion to RMB 1.36 trillion. Such facts do not support the notion of genocide, as Xinjiang would have been beset with social unrest, refugee issues, poor economies, and a declining population. Time is the best judge. Given its pivotal position in the Belt and Road Initiative, I envisage Xinjiang will prosper even further with improving regional integration, trading activities, and infrastructure. Perhaps in 10-20 years, do you think I am right about Xinjiang, or the viewpoints of these western media and propagandists?"

To be honest, at first, I was sympathetic to the Uyghur moment and decide to research more. The more I do my research I more felt like I had been fooled. For example, the World Uyghur Congress accuses China of Uyghur sterilization but if you check on World Uyghur Congress leader Rebiya Kadeer's family you be surprised how many kids she and your children have. Also, the Uyghur population in Xinjiang multiply doing the time when China had 1 child policy. 
She also got caught using fake photos and lying on national tv.

Some say that it is the world's largest prison with the most monitoring tools per unit area on the planet.

So I have no clue what she's talking about meso-american civilization, which didn't even exist until about 500 AD.  Nobody wiped out the Egyptian civilization or any of the other civilizations I have no idea what she's talking about who wiped them out? They were conquered by Macedonia which then transformed the region into a Hellenistic pluralistic civilization as was part of India conquered by Alexander's generals.

Al Y,"The United Nations Genocide Convention article two defines genocide as ""..any of the following acts committed with the INTENT TO DESTROY in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.""
Included are things like:
- Killing members of the group
- Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group
- Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in     whole or in part
- Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group
- Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group""

She is unfortunately very broadly casting that word about to the extent that the word loses much relevance because it could describe almost anything she wants it to mean. 
There has to be ""intentional action to DESTROY in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.""   
How many of the examples she glibly cited fit that ""intent to destroy"" criterion?
Yes, the early Islamic invasions occasioned massive slaughter that no doubt  qualified as attempted genocide.
But let us not conflate everything under one term. It won't work.
By her definition, trying to introduce Western ideas of empowering women is ""genocide."" Introducing and teaching English language is ""cultural genocide."" Trying to stop Dalits from being mistreated by there fellow Hindus is also ""cultural genocide."" 
 So practically any form of modernization can be interpreted by her definition to be ""cultural genocide.""  

The Jews were subjected to an intentional attempt at extermination during the holocaust. 
That is genocide without doubt. 
Kapoor is misusing the word so much as to render it almost meaningless as a means to accurately describe and compare different situations.  By the way, Dr. Kapoor has a doctorate in statistics - not history so please don't represent her as an expert in this area just by emphasizing ""Dr."" in front of her name.

Once again Hindus and Indians will be used as cannon fodder in strategic wars of attrition if you are not careful. India professes to be democratic but the ruling class still has the say.
I find Christianity is essentially Old Testament or Torah judaism and similar to Islam in many ways, not really Christian. Christianity is a reformation of Judaism and very different in practice.

Russell Hawkins,"This is a side of history that we hear virtually nothing about.  Is there not a single group on the planet that hasnt experienced the madness of maniacs? These are gross terrorist actions that were carried out against these people.  Which is kind of bizarre because all religions preach peace, therefore no terrorist/genocidal maniac is religious  they just wear the uniform, chant the chants and sing the songs.  Like spectators at a sporting event who will only ever stay in the stands yet never play the sport.
Its not Islam versus Hinduism or vice versa its Psychotic Maniacs versus innocent people just wanting to get on with their lives, and using the religion as a uniform, like a football thug / hooligan wears a football strip but never plays the game.
Hinduism has some fantastic aspects to its philosophy, with world leading yogic practices, and the Hindu texts on cosmology were giving the top 10 theoretical physicists on the planet the direction to go in for their research..  Also the Hindu Texts on human history and the history of the planet mirror exactly the geological records to perfection..  We know accurate human history because it all contained in the Hindu texts. And they state that the Earth has been home to 5 very advanced human civilisations over millions of years and each one was destroyed through natural catastrophe. To support this there are five super impact meteor craters on the planet, and in the UK we have five layers of anthracite coal, with a dead zone above and no fossil records,   yet, Slowly over time the fossil record returns as life recovers.   When the geologist saw this it terrified them.  But it proves that there is much truth contained in Hinduism which could benefit the whole world as it seems to be the oldest and most knowledgeable of faiths in many areas."
Kevin Guizan,"Biblical Christianity was distorted by Roman Catholics and in the name of Christianity Catholics have perpetrated great crimes in history. Dr. Melissa is referring to professing (not practicing) Christian European colonisers and warring Islamists.
Study well the works of Apostle Thomas beginning with his arrival in Cranganore (Kerala) in 52 AD ... He was martyred by Hindus in Mylapore near Chennai.
Abrahamic faith? Jews were living peacefully in India before Catholics and Islam brought great destruction to India. The British? They were expressly forbidden to convert Hindus, which is why a peaceful William Carey (non catholic British) had to find refuge in Serampore (under Protestant Danish) in his early works in Kolkata. He along with Ram Mohan Roy were instrumental in scorching British conscience to ban Hindu ritual wife burning called SATI.
   Simply generalising religions is not helpful. Read John 4:8-18 and 8:1-11 to discover how Jesus treated women... Some weep even today when they come across such compassion."

The Indian genocide in the greatest in the past 2000 years, it exceeds all others and other invasions by the Catholic Church, the European colonial powers, the Huns, Ghenghis Khan and the Indian empires of the West, Egypt  or Mesopotamia. World history is gross propaganda  and the world current leaders continue to deny the glory of Vedic Culture, which in our Vedas record 155.52 Trillion years till now.

This is a most refreshing video.

         ""216 The Islamic Connection - Total Onslaught - Walter Veith ""  Shocking news you present. I thought I would add to the shock by giving you and other viewers  this well founded and riveting  news. Dr. Veith  shows convincingly how the Roman Catholic church created the Islamic faith to destroy the enemies of the Catholic church. If you have ever wondered how the Islamic fighters  could Conquer most or all of the Holy Land, where Jesus disciples were very thick, you will have a few answers."
Uni Faqir,"Seems BJP funded concocted story  calling it research to hasten the genocide of Muslims in India. If this tale ""Hindu kush"" happened why Hindu historians and intellectual have been silent until now?. BJP/RSS agenda is not peace but strife , disharmony and destruction for India. People,  please don't sleepwalk into Hitler's Ideology, research the history and facts your selves."
hoong chan,What happened to the Chinese civilisation??
Francis Lobo,The talk of Dr. Melissa is not only informative but awe-inspiring and thought provoking how much genocide of Hindus has taken place for centuries. It is disheartening and so I am really sorry over this being an Indian. Why do our people stop all this? This should be one of our agenda. But hats off Dr. Melissa.
tean tan,"What I don't understand, Mellisa said, ""10s of millions of Hindus were killed by the British"", why are the current Indians still hold the British in High Regard, that is really puzzling me. The situation now is that the Indians are really suspicious of the Chinese and respecting/trusting the British, it should be the reverse. Those who can explain to me please do."

After downfall of tipu when the kodava jamma mapla came back to Hinduism to get reconverted the kodavas did not accept them back because they haded to give them property. That's the sad truth of kodava Jamma mapla.

Dr. Uasa,"Genetic scientific research 
performed by the University of  Utah ,  USA  clearly proved that the DNA of Brahmins ( and other Dwij / twice born / upper castes in lndia ) belongs to Eurasia steppes especially around Caspian sea ."
Dr. Uasa,"Eurasian steppes ( grasslands) Ashv-rohi ( Horse ridders) Aryans ( Brahmins , Kshatriyas , Vaishyas ) invaded Southern lndian sub-continent to enslave Dravidians ( Tamil , Telegu , Malayalam , Kannada  , Tulu ) long before Turkic-Persian rulers'  invasions on Aryan race of Northern lndia . Brahmin dharm ( Hindu religion ) was revived by Adi-Shankracha by destroying Buddhism in lndia . Buddhists monks were killed and forced to take refuge in neighbouring Buddhist countries ; Pali language Buddhist literature was burn to ashes ; Aryan Sanskrit was established by removing Buddhist Pali / Prakrit . Buddhist religious places of importance were forcefully occupied and converted into Brahmin religion temples . Later on , Buddhists took their revenge and relieved themselves from the tyranny of last Brahmin King of Sindh Raja Dahir by welcoming Muhammad bin Qassim in Sindh ... and many Buddhists and Hindus among them willingly accepted lslam due its principles of equality , social justice and fraternity. Jai Bharat."
MSR,Malabar was not captured by arabs so how were they able to forcefully converted local malabaris to Islam? Kerala was the very first place in entire South Asia where Islam spread and it did through the interaction with Arab merchants. Arab didnt conquered malabar and made the people Muslim through sword

shahul hameed,"Mapplies, lebbai, marikar, rawothar etc are indigenous Tamil origin clan of south India who originally converted to Muslims by knowing Islam increasingly through Arab traders...This is main reason you will find a close bonding between Hindus, Muslims and Christians in southern parts of India especially Tamilnadu and Kerala which you will never see in rest of India. Its obvious that they naturally cannot go against each other because of their genetic bonding that manifest between them in every walks of their life...these people will know and only speaks Tamil or Malayalam in their house hold and even their forefathers speaks the same and dont know Urdu or Hindi..."

Ashmeed Abdulla,"Complete nonsense and filled with lies distorting history to spread hate, being from Coorg and student of history Muslims inhabited Coorg well before Tippu Sultan and there are ample historical evidences for those who have an open mind. Even though Tippu converted few of the coorgis to Muslims the Muslim population in coorg was evident before it with mosques and dargas constructed before him. Historically Islam was spread in Kerala by arab traders and local hindu rulers also supported them financially providing land and helping them build mosques during the time of prophet Muhammad itself."

Muslims and Hindus in Kerala are living with harmony and peace, so do called pseudo intelle tual professor do not spread disinformation and manipulate the history, if Muslim Arab traders were trying to convert Hindus forcefully then now in Kerala the percentage of Muslims become at least 90% instead of 25 to 30%."

Because the fraternity between Hindus And muslims in kerala is that much stronger especially 8n malabar areas..
Where muslims are welcomed to hindus homes n vice versa for evening coffees..Functions.  
They share home in same courtyard...
They celebrate onam, eid, and all the religious n non religious restives together

M Talukdar,A good fiction to inflame hatred. A conflict between zaminders (landlord) and their  tenants /laborers working under them has been very nicely painted as a religious war.  The story of Zamindars (mostly Brahmins) supported by the mighty British India government and zaminders' private gundas  mercilessly massacred tenants (mostly Muslims) has been turned upsidedown.  This is nothing short of a trick to keep India weak.
Farry Bunny,"*PRESENT MOPLAH UPRISING MOST SERIOUS OF ALL*

*Was Organized Months In Advance*

*BY THOMAS STEWART RYAN.*
*(Chicago Tribute Foreign News Service)* MADRAS, DEC. 12 - Of all their thirty-five outbreaks against the British, the Moplahs present revolt is the most serious, both in extent and by virtue of its coincidence with the Gandhi crisis.

The British declare that the rising was organized for months in advance. Others were riots. This is rebellion. Gandhis promise of Swaraj in August ran like wildfire through the combustible Moplah country. Grievances of the Moslems against the Hindu landlords were dug up, though many Hindus shared the unrest and Gandhi Ki Jai was the watchword.

Volunteers appeared in uniform. Agitators reverted from non-violence to picturing houris in paradise for warriors fallen in battle. The Moplahs are Sunni Moslems who revere the sultan-caliph and loathe his enemies.

Dec. 6.Charges that the Moplahs of Malabar have put to death, many Hindus and forcibly converted others to Mohammedanism were denied and characterized as part of a British plot to discredit the Moplah movement for Indias independence. In a cablegram from Variamkunnath Kunhamed Haji. The Moplah leader. Received today by the friends of the freedom for India.

A few cases of conversion of our Hindu brethren have been reported to me, the message said. But after proper investigation we discovered the real plot. The vandals that were guilty of this crime were members of the British reserve police and British intelligence department and they joined our forces a as patriots to do such filthy work only to discredit our soldiers. There were Christians.  Hindus and Moplahs among these British agents and spies. They have deservedly been put to death.

V Kumar,My heart goes for those who went through all these brutalities. This genocide seems even worst than jallianwala bagh massacre
Pramod Nair,The saddest part is that this tragedy is still getting played out in Malabar and any hindu can be slaughtered still there. They live under the benevolence and mood swing of the moplahs

ken p,"Equal Education policy needed for India:
If English medium education is better in India then why not translate all English curriculum and Sanskrit literature in regional languages and provide equal education/information to all? Don't people read PM's Mann k Bt in all regional languages on websites? Don't they teach the Bible in all Indian languages? Sanskrit scholars provide Vedic knowledge to westerners in English via translation and transliteration but not the same way to fellow Indians who protect languages and culture in Indic scripts.Gujarat has given great political leaders as well as simple script to the nation and yet Hindi is taught in a complex printing ink wasting script despite its simplification into Gujangari script.
If pundits were happy with the complex printing ink wasting Devanagari script they may not have created various scripts under different rulers for vernacular languages to divide the country. Nowadays Devanagari Lipi Parishad prefers a single Devanagari script despite it's simplification into Gujangar script for all Indian languages to slowly eliminate vernacular scripts the way they did with Maharashtra's MODI script.
Westerners learn Sanskrit in English via translation and transliteration and challenge Indians but Indians are not allowed to learn Sanskrit the same way in vernacular languages.Why not make the same efforts in teaching mother language as you do for Sanskrit? How modern Sanskrit is going to be better than Vedic Sanskrit in providing knowledge? Does the government spend an equal amount of money on the promotion of all state languages.

Also India has more English speakers than Great Britain and yet Indian English doesn't have it own Indian English dictionary with pronunciation key to challenge IPA with highly phonetic Indic alphabets.http://sanskrit-ai.com/threads/mappings-for-devan%C4%81gar%C4%AB-indic-roman%C4%81gar%C4%AB.333/

farheen begam,"The Mappila or Malabar Uprising of 1921 marks a watershed in 20th Century Indian history.

Appu Kamath,MK Gandhi was an anti-national; it was Nehru and his cartel who tried to idealize him.  In case he was alive he would not have let Sardar Patel integrate Hyderabad.
Krishnakumar P,First and foremost most historians betrayed this nation for decades with their tales suited for their masters. Our whole history is fully distorted glorifying mughals with no mention of great warriors who truly fought for our great motherland. Our children read this shit and believe to trust others. We must never forget such heinous acts of crimes and reminder no to let this repeat. Secondly hindus are the most ignorant and are not united unless a fire rages in their backyard even after knowing history. One day they will get wiped out in the most humiliating and gruesome way if they do not act now. Rich cultural upkeep and heritage are more important than secularism. Others should blend with these and not the other way round. Many nations very proudly pronounce their cultural heritage and religion and stand by to protect it. Here secularism or anti hinduism are well portrayed to pacify the vote bank because of us - our ignorance and lack of unity.

The Visitor,"Muslims are rejected and mistreated and even sometimes killed in the West, in India, in Europe, in China, in Israel (Palestine) and recently in Korea toono one understands us muslims, no one cares to study about what Islam actually teaches, thay all purposefully let themselves be filled by what their corrupt medias falsely claim about Muslims because of their hatred of Islam. We Muslims arent afraid of you, we Muslims arent giving up hope, because we know full well that God Almighty is with us. Even the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was persecuted and exiled from his own hometown of Mecca and yet he was patient, he endured hardships, beatings and was nearly killed by stones being thrown at him and yet he endured and was patient through it all. May Allah Almighty grant us the patience that our Prophet had, may Allah bless and protect all of our Muslims brothers and sisters, may Allah grant you all Jannah and forgive you from your sins and inequities. Keep in your hearts my brothers and sisters that this world is transient, this world is nothing but a test for us and remember that God is indeed aware of what the disbelievers and the wrongdoers do against you, He will avenge you, He will reward them with what they deserve. Even if the whole universe turned against us Muslims we stand FIRM together!!   *I BEAR WITNESS THERE IS NO GOD BESIDES ALLAH AND THAT MUHAMMAD IS HIS LAST AND FINAL MESSENGER* .

*(42). And never think that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do. He only delays them [i.e., their account] for a Day when eyes will stare [in horror].*
*(43). Racing ahead, their heads raised up, their glance does not come back to them, and their hearts are void.*

But now by marking out  Muslims as the other they have managed to get the vote of the lower castes who by the way happen to share the political space and had common cause with Muslims. And why is this being done simple as a smoke screen to hide the corruption lack of governance the complete and absolute destruction of the indian economy the shambles that's been made of the armed forces among other things....a smoke screen to hide poverty hunger and death

Since 2 months, continues interviews conducted, Marketing and direct sales with salaries and commissions, the Educational requirement put down to zero as the requirement as we kept meeting people and appointed, the story begins once we start operations shamelessly they see what is the job stands right in front of your store or office, no money, no knowledge, 10 guys invest spoils the work and also the market, coming to girls appointments, 
the funniest part ever seen in my working life, interviews attended by husbands, their conditions are the most shameful ever heard in my entire life, in a line if i can descrbie their demand is 
I am the Husband, I can'T offer her comfort, peace, attentions, life promised before marriage, or sit like a queen at my home, so you must hire her and keep her in your office, she cant speak well, even gujarati, english to dur ki baat hain, she has no knowledge of communications, emails, writing, dressing sense, behaving like a professional women, but hire her, pay her and teach her, on top of it salaries that i tell you not what you offer,

Total number of CV boys and girls 192 
deserving person 0 of 192
males 78 of 0 selected
females lol
Now I am just having this thought in my mind as they all come from a small area as this was part of job requirement where hardly 20000 to 30000 thousand people lives, we see 100's of ad for job, if i got about 200 CV interviews conducted I am sure Indians are expecting a lot more then what they deserve, Narendra modi is totally wrong when he is expecting these Indians to work or when he says india is future having youngest population, what indians are is only shame on their own land, full of corruption, full of dirt around them, (but every house of their own is the most cleaned) only full of big words of being proud to be indian, read news papers see tv and make only statements but in real wont change them first and expect others then, worst educated presentation, worst family and life style full of control, only money greed no honesty or moral responsibilites, i am getting short of words but at the end Yes I AM TOO AN INDIAN CONSIDERED A BIG FOOL MYSELF BEING BORN AS INDIANS OR AMONGS THESE INDIANS
AND YES ABUSERS AND OPPSORS IF YOU HAVE ANY THING TO SAY AGAINSTS WHAT THESE REAL FACTS ARE THEN PLEASE FIND ME A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN TELL ME TO EXPERIENCE THESE FACTS ARE WRONG IF NOT DONT PUT RESPONSES JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE A BIG COMMUNITY LIKE PATEL, RAJPUT, DALIT, SUTHAR AND ETC ITS ABOUT INDIANS IN COMMON BECAUSE IF YOU WERE NOT HUMAN THEN YOU WONT HAVEN BEEN INDIAN,.

R Singh,PM Modi has already started tightening the noose on China one of the examples is banning Chinese business in India. It has already started showing the effect. Businesses in China are closing down and unemployment is increasing. Chinese labours are entering illegally in Taiwan and other neighbouring countries and  are being caught. So these illegal labours are either put in the jails or pushed back to China. Other major countries like USA and Europe and the UK are following Modi's example. Soon China will be like Pakistan.

Swapan Chakravarthy,"Civil rights are for all mankind but rarely goes beyond lines in a textbook. The issues in Northern part of Burma is as old as 1948 when they gained independence. First it was the Indian population which under PM Shastri found a solution however distasteful. Second, nationalisation took place post 1962, and of course with Buddhist majority, anything beyond following that faith was unacceptable. Social misdemeanours and difficulties in access meant lax impositions until about 20-years ago. Now let me add that Bangladesh is finding it very difficult with the Rohingyas who have been sheltered by them to warn that religion is no bond. Indeed civic rights and dispute resolution is the key. Taking up even medieval arms is sufficient provocation. The fate that LTTE has undergone in another Buddhist majority state should be a fair indicator of political domination is the overwhelming factor that defines the conflict."

For your kind information, this video is moving over Internet more than one month and INDIA TODAY waked up today. This was a reaction of siege to Rohingya people by the #Burmese military and Burmese government made this siege as they do not respect the #KofiAnnan suggestion regarding citizenship law.

What is INDIATODAY's personal interest to call terrorist only Rohingya people while there other ethnic groups are fighting against Burmese cruelty since decades such as Kachin, Shan, Karen etc. Why you are not calling them terrorist?

Sorry to say you are not a media. Just because of you like media, this world is going to worse and worst.

Zubair Mohammad,"Let's see what history says about the rohingya and who the real oppressors are:
8th Century: The Rohingya, a people of South Asian origin, dwelled in an independent kingdom in Arakan, now known as Rakhine state in modern-day Myanmar.
9th to 14th Century: The Rohingya came into contact with Islam through Arab traders. Close ties were forged between Arakan and Bengal.
1784: The Burman King Bodawpaya conquered Arakan and hundreds of thousands of refugees fled to Bengal. He feared the spread of Islam in the region. From then on he began to persecute the Muslims.
1790: Hiram Cox, a British diplomat sent to assist refugees, established the town of Coxs Bazar in Bangladesh, where many Rohingya still live today.
1824 to 1942: Britain captured Burmanow known as Myanmarand made it a province of British India. Workers were migrated to Burma from other parts of British India for infrastructure projects.
1942: Japan invaded Burma, pushing out the British. As the British retreated, Burmese nationalists attacked Muslim communities who they thought had benefited from British colonial rule.
1945: Britain liberated Burma from Japanese occupation with help of Burmese nationalists led by Aung San and Rohingya fighters. Rohingyas felt betrayed as the British didnt fulfill a promise of autonomy for Arakan.
1948: Tensions increased between the government of newly independent Burma and the Rohingya, many of whom wanted Arakan to join Muslim-majority Pakistan. The government retaliated by ostracizing the Rohingya, including removing Rohingya civil servants.
1950: Some Rohingya resisted the government, led by armed groups called Mujahids. The insurgency gradually died down.
1962: General Ne Win and his Burma Socialist Programme Party seized power and took a hard line against the Rohingya.
1977: The junta began Operation Nagamin, or Dragon King, which they said was aimed at screening the population for foreigners. More than 200,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh, amid allegations of army abuses. The army denied any wrongdoing.
1978: Bangladesh struck a U.N.-brokered deal with Burma for the repatriation of refugees, under which most Rohingya returned.
1982: A new immigration law redefined people who migrated during British rule as illegal immigrants. The government applied this to all Rohingya, and stripped off them citizenship. They were denied ability to travel freely and access to resources were limited.
1989: The army changed the name of Burma to Myanmar.
1991: More than 250,000 Rohingya refugees fled what they said was forced labor, r@pe and religious persecution at the hands of the Myanmar army. The army said it was trying to bring order to Rakhine.
1992 to 1997: Around 230,000 Rohingya returned to Arakan, now known as Rakhine, under another repatriation agreement.
2012: Rioting between Rohingya and Rakhine Buddhists killed more than 100 people, mostly Rohingya. Tens of thousands of people were driven into Bangladesh. Nearly 150,000 were forced into camps in Rakhine.
2016: Rohingya resistance group Harakah al-Yaqin, after being pushed to breaking point by oppression, attacked border guard posts, killing nine soldiers. The army retaliated. More than 25,000 people fled Rakhine to Bangladesh, bringing accounts of killing, r@pe and arson. Aung San Suu Kyis government denied the atrocities. 
.Coming up update more information in 2017 over 600.000 Rohingyan have been flee to the Bangladesh and more than 4000people have been killed brutality by Burmese military and Buddhist.
Rohingyan people  still more and more continuously fleeing to the Bangladesh   . It's last step taken Burmese military genocide to the poor innocent Rohingyan people."
Zubair Mohammad,"No1.That death body are all Rohingyan an a few Rohingyan Hindu  killed by Burmese military and Buddhist..
That what Burmese government always do.
And Burmese military are biggest lies government in the world  please don't listen to this fake news made up by Burmese military..
2nd also Because of the pressure international community to Burma military so military don't know what to do. But don't worried my brother and sister in India or all over the world please be patient truth always will come up soon or later..
3rd reason why Burmese government not allowed the international investigation enter into the Burma???
4th in Arakan State Rohingyan and Hindus we live as a brother and sister and also we speak same language. That why Burmese government trying to make us dividing it creating more problem in the society..
So they can get way from international pressure and to get attention. And Rohingyan people and Rohingyan hindu have been facing genocide many decades in Burma.. I hope you all understand thanks..."

KO YE ONE,"During colonial time, the British Government conducted nationwide census in Burma and there was no record of ethnicity ""Rohingya"" in the census reports. Do fact checks in the old news papers, census reports and university literatures in the British libraries.

It's too late to deceive the world with a new invented ethnic name that didn't exist before 1948. 

Those Bengali adult people used to come across the border into Rakhine state for working in the paddy fields in 2 seasons a year, planting seasons and harvesting seasons. They tried to save money during those 2 working seasons and during off seasons they went back to their homes in now Bangladesh. Rakhine state was prosperous and it was too costly for them to live in. 

Those people are illiterate and not able to learn, read nor speak Burmese Language. If their claims of living in the Rakhine state for generations are really true, majority of those people should be able to read, write and speak Burmese National Language. They speak Chittagonian, one of the dialects spoken inside Bangladesh.

The British armed local Rakhine and those Bengali people for Japanese resistance during the second world war. After having arms from the British, those Bengali people came up with a Mujahidin rebellion against the Burmese government that gained independence from the British Colonial rule. 

They failed the ambitious plan of getting autonomy, an independent state and annexation to then so called East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).

This is the time those muslim people in the northern Rakhine state have to drop their new ambitious evil plans of making the region one of the Islamic Caliphates without having contented with the status quo. 

Those people do not even have their own written language so before the recent attacks on Myanmar Border Police Posts, those muslim militants and helpers in the villages communicated with only voice mail messages using the mobile phones among themselves. 

Burmese government has intercepted and gathered enough intelligence information to act appropriately. Those people use mobile phones with Bangladeshi mobile networks and Bangladesh has now banned Rohingya using mobile phones. 

Those Rohingya supporters in the outside world are acting blur and actually they know what exactly those people are doing by getting donations from some Middle Eastern Countries. 

Today's advanced science and technology can examine, identify, solve the mystery and reveal the truth. Ancestry DNA check on those people in the Northern Rakhine State can easily prove that they belong to Chittagong and elsewhere in Bangladesh.

Which nations on earth would grant the Jihadists the citizenships of their country after witnessing countless terrors and atrocities committed by those extremists all over the world?"

To say that the many military type weapons are a result of the one killing rade conducted on a group of Myanmar police officers is ludicrous.  People are not that gullible; how about telling the truth.
Rosa Frausto,"The Rohingya keep on portraying themselves as innocent bystanders who are targeted by the Myanmar Military for no reason at all!  Now, people, is this rational thinking?  Has the world forgotten the slotter of Buddhists (by Islamists) all over the Middle East!"
Rosa Frausto,"It is about time that the existence of the ARSA is RECOGNIZED.  Their atrocities also need to be divulged!  Buddhists do not rape--it is NOT part of their culture; however, jihadists do, as it is sanction by their beliefs.  It is also most unfortunate that the Rohingya & some media outlets keep on projecting Rohingya ARSA practiced on to the Myanmar Military."

Han Maung,"Why adverse comments from muslims? 

Firstly, even though Myanmar government gave citizenships and equal rights to many immigrant so called Rohingyas, their desires still cannot be fulfilled. They want to make Rakhine state their own state. They want to falsely claim that they are the native people. They allied with Taliban as well as Al Qaeda, and they want to kick Rakhine people out of Rakhine state. They want to govern Rakhine state as their own state.

Secondly, the only freedom of belief in Islam is the freedom to become Muslim; blindly following their Wahabism and ""muslim ummah"" and devoid of critical thinking. Thus, there is no way for a muslim to reform or assimilate and advance forward or freeing themselves towards a common humanity and morality. People who have left Islam were Muslims for many years or decades, and their insight and warnings are particularly eye opening, frightening, insightful, and more. Ali Sina, Ayan Hirsi Ali, Hassan Mosan Yousef, Nonie Darwish, Brigitte Gabriel, Wafi Sultan, Salman Rushdie, Ibn Warraq are all highly recommend - read their books, watch their youtube videos, see their websites.....

Thirdly, if Buddhists (or Buddhism) were at fault, they should probably be attacking Christians and Hindus too. At least some type of discrimination against Christians which is the 2nd largest religious community in Myanmar which has never happened In fact. Hindus have suffered a large brunt of recent islamic terrorism. Christians and Hindus, the 2nd and 4th largest communities, by population, are integrating just fine"

Shrihari kulkarni,"The conflict in the region arises chiefly from social differentiation and conflict between Rohingya Muslims and local Rakhine Buddhists. DuringWorld War II in Burma(present-day Myanmar), Rohingya Muslims (allied with the British and promised a Muslim state in return) fought against local Rakhine Buddhists, who were allied with the Japanese. Following independence in 1948, the newly formedunion governmentof the predominantly-Buddhist country denied citizenship to the Rohingya, subjecting them to extensive legal discrimination in the country, widely compared toapartheid.[according to whom?]From 1947 to 1961,local Rohingya mujahideenfought government forces in an attempt to have the mostly Rohingya populated region around theMayu peninsulain northern Arakan (present-day Rahkine State) gain autonomy or secede, so it could be annexed byEast Pakistan(present-dayBangladesh).[24]During the late 1950s and early 1960s, the mujahideen lost most of its momentum and support, resulting in most of them surrendering to government forces.[25][26]

In the 1970s Rohingya Islamist movements began to emerge from remnants of the mujahideen, and the fighting culminated with the Burmese government launching a massive military operation namedOperation King Dragonin 1978.[27]In the 1990s, the well-armedRohingya Solidarity Organisationwas the main perpetrator of attacks on Burmese authorities near the MyanmarBangladesh border.[28]"

Peta Gonkyi,Dalai Lama came to India in 1959 but before that Nehru sold Tibet to China in 1954.
Peta Gonkyi,Syed Assim Bhukari should know how many Muslims are given asylum in India millions. Compared that with Tibetan refugee is very small compared to Muslim refugees in India.  Syed is talking as if that India has not taken Muslim refugees but only Tibetans and Hindus. How many millions of Bangladeshi have come to India in 1970s?
Peta Gonkyi,Tibetans and the Dalai Lama will leave India if India abrogate 1954 treaty India signed China behind the back of Tibetan. To make Tibetan stateless will only invalidate the McMohan line invalid as border as it was signed with Tibetan as an independent Tibet in 1914 which Nehru falsified in 1954.
Peta Gonkyi,Why the lady and anchor is bringing up the Dalai Lama. He has brought glory to India in the world.
Peta Gonkyi,"India had to endure border issue with the China for giving asylum to the Dalai Lama and Tibetan but the anchor should know that Tibetans had lost Tibet as India deceptively signed treaty with China in 1954 converting Indo-Tibetan border to Sino-Indian.

Who sacrificed more Indians or Tibetans?"

Mukesh Pandey,Sanju Verma is only making good point here.
AUTHENTIC WARRIOR,Informative debate...let India be free from future terrorist attacks and let not others give chance of abusing govt later that they should have been deported at early stage..
Mohan Rama,First of all they are not Indians and they should be deported to their country i.e. Burma.India govt should talk to Burma and ask them to accept them as they are not Indians and cannot stay illegal in any country for that matter. Also it is a big National Security issue.Infact their cannot be any debate on this. I think Indian govt is doing the right think and they should be send to Burma with respect in consultation with the Burma govt as they belong to Burma and not India.
Shray Pandya,Good job by anchor..
Vinay Shetty,Will people supporting the Rohingyas give an undertaking in the courts...stating that they are guaranters for the Rohingya and if any Rohingya commints any crime all of them should be held responsible and should be treated as equally responsible for the crimes and ready to be punished accordingly...Even if it is 40000 Rohingyas why should even any loss of life happen to citizens of my country

Karen Karen,"Grassed up: Facebook leads Myanmar police to weed-growing Americans
AFP AFPApril 25, 2019
Police raided the 20-acre site in Ngunzun township to find nearly 350,000 marijuana plants - after being tipped off by photos on Facebook

More
Myanmar police have arrested one American and two locals after photos on Facebook led them to a huge plantation of towering marijuana plants near Mandalay.

Pictures of the fields of weed started circulating on the platform last week -- a rare sight online in a country where police photos of seized heroin and methamphetamine are far more common.

Police raided the 20-acre site in Ngunzun township Monday to find nearly 350,000 marijuana plants -- some up to two metres tall -- 380 kilograms of seeds and 270 kilograms of marijuana, the Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC) announced Wednesday.

A released photo showed arrested US citizen John Fredric Todoroki, 63, standing alongside Myanmar nationals Shein Latt, 37, and Ma Shun Le Myat Noe, 23.

Another man, 49-year-old Alexander Skemp Todoroki, is still ""at large"", the CCDAC said.

Police confirmed he is also American.

The detainees have been charged under the Anti-Narcotics Drug and Psychotropic Substances Law, though it remains unclear what penalties they will face if found guilty.

""We didnt know this (marijuana plantation) existed,"" one local police officer told AFP, asking not to be named.

""We only found out when we were tipped off about it.""

Seizures of heroin, pills and crystal meth by authorities are more common in Myanmar, where weak rule of law and conflict-riddled border areas allow for the industrial-scale production of harder drugs.

Reaction on Facebook was swift, with some offering high praise for the arrests.

Others questioned how the pot growers had been able to get away with it for so long.

""How could the plants have grown so big without you allowing it?"" Facebook user Kg Zoe Law commented at the police.

But not everyone's nose was put out of joint by the agronomists' antics.

""Let me know where it'll be burned so I can get in position,"" San Yu Ko Ko pleaded."

Coco Productions,Dalai lama has called for the help from India to stop this
Aimee May,"It is true that Myanmar's government doesnt give them an equal right or consider them as Myanmar citizens.But it is not true that they committed genocide.It all started with Rohingya armed forces ambushing a lot of police stations in Rakhine State and also killed other innocent ethnic groups residing there .And they claimed that those ambushes and attacks were for their rights.That was when Myanmar military stepped in to protect the innocent people in Rakhine state from Rohingya armed forces.I think Rohingya should have protested peacefully for their rights instead of killing other innocent people and police in Rakhine State.
I am not saying what myanmar military did was right.I am burmese and I know how corrupted myanmar military actually is.
But it was not ethnic cleansing like most media portrayed.I think the world should listen to stories from both sides.
Lastly,I hope one day all  rohyingya brothers and sisters get the rights they deserve."

Extreme Islam is spreading and causing major problems for this country and the local cultures and towns.

Myanmar is in a fragile state...the Rohingya issue is just another issue on top of many."
Abee Fone,They are not Myanmar people. They were illegally entered to Myanmar from Bangala. Myanmar people are not acceptable them to stay together. Because of different culture. Also they are not following laws of Myanmar. So that they cannot be Myanmar citizens.

F,"There is no ethnic namely Rohingya in Myanmar or world.
Rohingya is not an ethnic,they are Bangali( immigrated from 
Bangladesh).But their motherland's government (Bangladesh) don't want to
 accept them back. There is no problem if they love different cultures 
(especially buddhists' culture) and want to coexist peacefully. But 
their birth rate is increasing rapidly and ambitiously. Now, there are 25,553 Rakhine nationals and 444,390 Bangalis 
living in Maungdaw,and 46,192 nationals and 230,000 Bangalis in 
Butheedaung. Now, they make an ethnic name and claim for citizenship but
 they deny Myanmar's Citizenship law as  they realize there is no 
possibility of acquiring a nationality. So, they start islamization and 
exploiting Myanmar Crisis with Fake,fabricated by the help of muslim 
countries and wastren medias(like OIC and UN,etc..).A lot of burmese 
buddhist girls murder and rapes  by Rohingyas (Bangali) muslim for a 
long time. But I never seen about that on any medias. Why? Simple, Most 
of the countries on the world are Islamic countries. We coexisting with 
our christian ethnic like Karen, Kachen, Chin without any religious 
problems. Myanmar have a lot 
of foreign immagrants like indians, Napalese, Chinese and so on. We are 
coexisting with them without any problems for a long time. Why? They 
respect our cultures and don't claim for citizenship and ethnic. They 
don't want to invade our land.That is why~~and why? why???? Why did they
 destroy buddhism's honour and image? But I still loving our minority 
myanmar muslim brothers not immigrated Bangali. May all beings free from
 dangers/\"

As I know, Burma government lock down the Rohingya place for many years, Why their media are so sure that many Rohingya are being persecuted. It's a shame that they don't even bother about other minorities in Myanmar, including Hindu. According to the Burma news report, over 100 Hindu are killed by those Rohingya too. Why you guys are so being silence?, why you guys are being on one side?  AJ is a Musilm media and so biased.

Mitsu Saha,"First of all i am a human and I felt the pain of those people crying in the video it made my eyes moist and my heart heavy. Majority has done and are doing their job why just Burma take the example for Bangladesh and Kashmir where thousands of Hindus were killed and thousands have fled the same way. Now I am not justifying here or taking sides. Those who got killed, tortured and chased are poor people and above all humans like you and I. I am extremely sad after watching all these videos of violence. If we go back to history Muslims were never part of that society hence it will be obvious for a particular group which is racially, ethnically, and religiously different being attacked. Acceptance, tolerance, awareness, recognition and respect towards each other can only solve this problem in Burma. Regarding the person and his team who went for the interview and documentary or fact finding thing one thing i must say Thank you for showing me the other side of the coin as well, now i know that violence effects the minority the most. But a small suggestion also take some steps in your country as well. Also check whether your country has the same policy or your people in your country treat the minorities or immigrants the same way because if they do you must know what pain they have been through to reach there and what they aim and hope to receive from you. I don't support  the Buddhist here the Muslims have now become very much part of their country and they must make strong laws to make everyone safe and equal rights be given to every one. I am from India and in my country some crazy Muslims and Hindus live but they cannot go berserk because our laws are strong. Its a racial thing here in Burma more than religion for example if all of them (Muslims) were Hindus and by appearance they did not look mongoloid they would face the same consequence as the Muslims did. Anywhere in the world even in America religion will come into play always.. A crime committed will become a Muslim did this to our Burmese sister not as a criminal committed this crime if a mongoloid does the same crime it will become a normal news and will not receive much hype because he is considered part of that ecosystem."

Holy Nightwing fan,"I think these so called ""buddhists"" have never read nor followed their own teachings:





""Hatred is never appeased by hatred in this world. By non-hatred alone is hatred appeased. This is a law eternal."" (Dhp I - 5)





""One who, while himself seeking happiness, oppresses with violence other beings who also desire happiness, will not attain happiness hereafter."" (Dhp  X - 131)





""Overcome the angry by non-anger; overcome the wicked by goodness; overcome the miser by generosity; overcome the liar by truth."" (Dhp XVII - 223)





""One should not strike a holy man, nor should a holy man, when struck, give way to anger. Shame on him who strikes a holy man, and more shame on him who gives way to anger."" 


""He who does no evil in deed, word and thought, who is restrained in these three ways  him do I call a holy man."" 


""Not by matted hair, nor by lineage, nor by birth does one become a holy man. But he in whom truth and righteousness exist  he is pure, he is a holy man.""(Dhp XXVI - 389, 339, 391)





""He abused me, he struck me, he overpowered me, he robbed me."" Those who harbor such thoughts do not still their hatred.

""He abused me, he struck me, he overpowered me, he robbed me."" Those who do not harbor such thoughts still their hatred. (Dhp I - 3,4)"
Holy Nightwing fan,"Those people are not real buddhists! Differently from other religions scriptures there is NONE that supports discrimination! Buddha was even against the caste system!

""Not by matted hair, nor by lineage, nor by birth does one become a holy man. But he in whom truth and righteousness exist  he is pure, he is a holy man."" Dhp XXVI-393

Nigrodha, you may think: The contemplative Gotama says that just to get more disciples. But you shouldnt think that way. May your master remain your master. 

Or you may think: He wants us to abandon our rules. But you shouldnt think that way. May your rules remain the same. 

Or you may think: He wants us to abandon our way of life. But you must not think that way. May your way of life remain the same. 

Or you might think: He wants us to do things that according to our teaching are wrong and are considered by us to be. But you shouldnt think that way. May those things that you think are wrong continue to be considered that way. 

Or you may think: He wants to keep us from those things that according to our teaching are correct and are considered by us to be like this. But you shouldnt think that way. May those things that you think are right continue to be considered that way. Nigrodha, I do not speak due to any of these causes ...


There are, Nigrodha, awkward things that have not been abandoned, contaminated, that lead to rebirth, terrifying, that produce painful results in the future, associated with birth, aging and death. It is for the abandonment of these things that I teach Dhamma. 
If you practice accordingly, these contaminated things will be abandoned, and the things that lead to purification will develop and increase, and you will achieve and remain, performing for yourself in the here and now the fullness of the perfection of wisdom.  (DN 25)"

Seed Lord,The comments here are disgusting and abhorrent. The Rohingya have been in Myanmar for centuries yet they are called illegal immigrants. They were asked for proof of ancestry in order to gain citizenship yet the government razes the only places they can possibly get evidence from as individuals. People justify an ethnic genocide by claiming an entire ethnic group should be prosecuted because a pathetically small decimal of a percentage of people who share the same faith have committed terrorism. A religious Buddhist figure in Myanmar claims that Muslims will become like Jackals if they ever become strong yet he says so without the slightest self awareness as to how his people have been committing inhumanly cruel acts unbefitting of any animal. If you don't care about what I said then fine. But what of the kids? the babies who drown while trying to get to safety from murder? Must they suffer because of what ever unreasonable hatred you have to the Rohingya as an ethnic peoples?

The country would shut down as the military takes over again. Would you want that to happen? I have faith in her and she knows many things that we dont. She stayed under house arrest for 15 years just so she can help the many strangers; some who are ungrateful; from the clutches of an uncaring cruel military that cashed in on the country's riches and oppressed any minority they can find.

Juan Vargas,"Burma: A Human Tragedy, dir. Neil Hollander. Angelica Huston, Aung San Suu Kyi. On a moral scale, the genocide of the Rohingya, these crimes against humanity, are tantamount to the genocide of Jews by the Nazis. 1) The world ignored the evidence they were quickly becoming aware of. 2) The world felt it was none of their business if some ethnic or religious group get killed so long as it doesn't land on their doorstep. 3) World leaders turn their backs. The United Nations is typical in its paralyses, but largely doesn't care, so long as they get their paychecks. 4) Mass graves have just been reported and 2 reporters are in all likelihood ""disappeared. 5) Aung San Suu Kyi has shown herself to be a narcissist hypocritical war crimes collaborator  she should be stripped of her Nobel ""Peace prize. Her name will live in infamy. She is ow an unindicted war criminal. 6) The Burmese military junta is using HIV as weapon of war, to commit genocide. They order their soldiers, especially those with AIDS or HIV to rape the Rohingya with impunity. 7) The military junta has as its aim to Burmacize the population through rape and genocide. 8) In a world climate where Trump has declared war on Muslims there is little hope that the US will use any of its power or will to intercede, thus making it complicit in the murder of children, the rape of girls and women, and the genocide of the Rohingya and Karen peoples  for trump this is par for his course.

Test Konto,"I spent the last hour reading up on this matter.
- The Rohingya are deprived of the right to free movement and the right to higher education. 
- They have been denied Burmese citizenship since the Burmese nationality law was enacted. 
- They are not allowed to travel without official permission.
- They were previously required to sign a commitment not to have more than two children, though the law was not strictly enforced. 
- They are subjected to routine forced labour. (Typically, a Rohingya man will have to give up one day a week to work on military or government projects, and one night a week for sentry duty.)
- The Rohingya have also lost a lot of arable land, which has been confiscated by the military and given to Buddhist settlers from elsewhere in Myanmar.
Then the myanmar goverment has the gall to say that they want them out because they commit more crime? Ofcourse they do! They have no other options for fucks sake.
This is like apartheid 2.0.
Despicable."

uk kl,Aung San Suu Kyi is right. Most people want peace. For this reason and reason alone all all illegal bengali must be removed from Rakhine state as well as other parts of myanmar. The place to send them is BBC's country UK and place them in East London. There the mayor of London being a muslim will look after their walfare.
Vickielindstrander,"British Army had brought the Rohingya from Bengal. British gave the land which had taken away from Burma.
But British Army kicked away by Japanese army. Then Rohingya had lost their country & land.
Rohingya & Myanmar needs apology from BBC, not a blame.All these causes are in UK. Britain is obligated to accept these refugees."
uk kl,bbc is fake news. if you don't believe ask the US president Donald Trump. He will tell you so. The Americans and Brits do not believe them. They do not watch nor listen them. We the people of myanmar are so naive to believe them.

John Pereira,Deportation of the Rohingyas is a neccessary step. The Rohingyas do contain highly radicalized young men who will strive to destabilize India and  give a bad name to the the indigenous Muslim population who are quite peaceloving. Hypocrite Prashant Bhushan can't see beyond the tip of his nose.
vishnu mr,Abrahamic people should give them refuge..it's not a responsibility of dharmic people
vishnu mr,White women just love them muslims
madiam 4u,France take them. Enjoy more Charlie Hebdo and Nice. Soon France will be Islamic State.
ജോസപ്പേ,Send the rohingyas to France..France is more developed than India.
Shambhu Rai,"These is the very problem of these western peoples they know nothing about India and it's plural soceity but preach that they know everything. I really feel sorry for them becoz this  type of wrong judgements create problems. The Rohingyacrisis is a matter of concern for every human being but then these crisis should be resolved by the concerned parties (theLeadership of Myanmar & Rohingyas & the Buddhists). At last I would say that before commenting on India they should also take in consideration the very fact that India has accepted many immigrants then any other nation 
1) consider zorastarians from Iran travelled all the way to India 
2) Jewish as they say ""India is the only place where we have not been persecuted"" rest of the thing is clear
3) Bangladesh - Millions of Bangladeshi refugees arrived in India even many of them have become Indian citizens.
I think atleast west should not teach us moral lessons  as everyone knows 
1)Jewish were treated as untouchables all over the Europe 
2) Germans were regarded inferior mostly in France 
Everything is recorded in history ...."
Shashank Shrivastava,"Mira Kamdar must stay in India for sometime to understand the complex socio economic construct in a nation of billion plus people. It is easy to stay abroad and make sweeping comments about a country and claim authority over the same just because of ancestry or heritage. India's economic growth has slowed down and there are millions who are anxiously waiting for jobs and social security. Who is going to get jobs for Rohingya's while the citizens are jobless? It is putting strain on over burdened economy. Also, India has its own aspirations with respect to South East Asia. There is an urgent need to open North East for trade and Myanmar is the gateway to South East Asia. There are also issues about insurgency and India needs co-operation of the Myanmar Government. None of these issues were touched upon by the respected guest and the rhetoric of anti muslim sentiments were played out without proper research. 
This was a disappointing discussion with lack of agenda and imagination to take a holistic view of a dynamic, multi facet and evolving crises."
ChristianP,Where aren't muslims a security threat?
Richie Rodrigues,"if rohigya dont leave people in india should kill them and force them out

bec their leader is atta ullah from pakistan, and he is will isi, they can target indian cities"
Melodic Nostalgic,"We Indians have nothing in common with Rohingaya, Different Culture, Different Religion, Different Food. Why force us to accept them ? Let them head to Bangladesh and Indonesia which they will find more suitable."
sree,"There is sympathy for these people. But we cannot ignore the very basis of existence of countries in the Indian sub-continent. In 1947, Indian subcontinent was divided into Pakistan and Bangladesh for muslims and India for Sikhs and Hindus. Hindus and Sikhs have India as a homeland where they are welcome from neighbouring countries. Muslims like Rohingyas have Pakistan and Bangladesh as their homeland and it is where they should be. They cannot carve out land for themselves and then move into other people's land. It is disgraceful that Pakistan has not taken in any of the current set of Rohingya refugees when the very creation of their country was to be a homeland of these people."
Suraj Sahu,"I think india should Send those Rohingyas to these 2 ladies house & let's see after 1 month they come back to the same channel and deliver your dramatic lecture and Send them all to France also lol this Cheap journalists and anchors, by the way this Terriorist dont belong to India then why we need to keep them who are killing cows in our country and don't respect our religion or country..or neither following India's rules and regulations
If France wants than we can airlift them to France. And What about the Racial Genocide of Hindus and Sikhs in Kashmir, inside Pakistan from 1947   Hindus were 27% in Pakistan and  now it was  less than 1 % and happinning same at Bangladesh also and there are  many  muslim nations in this world maybe more then 50 and who have enough wealth so your French News channel should ask them to take these so called refugees and this all

Daneshwari Hammond,"UN and international amnesty can find another place for Rohingyas. Globe is large enough to accommodate Rohingya. UNO can find alternative accommodation for Rohingya but infedel over populated India where water crisis and malnutrition as well poverty are ongoing issues.

America, Canada, Australia can accommodate Rohingya or even Myanmar can take back Rohingya into budhist fold. What's so great about Islam that stubborn Rohingya can not give into budhist monks instructions on living?"
Daneshwari Hammond,"Rohingya have  arrived to India, so as to secure Islam. Rohingya were pressurised to conversion into Buddhism by budhist monks. That Rohingyas resisted. And so, instead chose to move into India where Islam can be exercises. 

It appears Rohingyas are in wrong. 

What's so special about Islam that Rohingya can not accept budhist instructions."

Unlike Tibetians, they are illegal migrants in our country! We have taken lakhs of muslim refugees during the Bangladesh war and till date lakhs of Bangladeshis are crossing over to India as illegal migrants. However, Mr. Owaisi, I do not hear any strong speech or concern from you against the ouster of Kashmiri Pandits from their homeland and they are living like refugees in their own country! I am asking you, what duty have you shown towards rehabilitating these Kashmiri Pandits.  Moreover, we are a country with massive population and we have our own problems to resolve, we cannot take more burden of taxation to feed them in the name of seculiar or democracy! I have a suggestion, why don't you provide food, shelter, love and compassion  to at least 10 - 20 Rohingyas refugees  by opening your house door to them, you can surely afford to do so, can't you, till the center decides something for them!"

วิวัฒน์ ชูติกมลธรรม,"The root of Rohingya problems came from the vicious policy of ""Divide and Rule"" by the past British Empire.  During the colonial era, the Brits brought in a large number of people from Bengal (nowadays Bangladesh) into the western state ""Rakine"" of Burma to work as agricultural and mining labors.  Some were employed as the low-ranking soldiers to suppress/beat up the local Rakine people who were non-submissive to the British Rule, hence created enmity and hatred of Rohingya among the Burmese people.  It is surprising that people of the UNited Kingdom are very quiet and low-profile, pretending they have nothing to do with this Rohingya problem, though their previous generations were in fact the root of this mess.  Shame on all Brits that you shrug off the responsibility for the sins of your previous generations."

Rohingyas are living in miserable conditions and these torch-bearers of 'Indian Tradition of welcoming anyone and everyone' did not even accommodate a single Rohingya family in their homes so that at least one Rohingya Family could get adequate food and that family's children could get an education.
All these hypocrites can do is to sit in their AC rooms and advocate for Rohingyas to stay here in India and eat into the already scarce resources of poor and deprived Indian people and then wait for them to do some bomb-blasts to kill few hundred middle and lower class Indians. These hypocrites are presenting themselves as saviour of humanity at the cost of food and life of poor Indian people."

HOWEVER, the Myanmar military have been using this as an excuse to mass murder average everyday Rohingya civilians at large, which is why so many sought asylum in Bangladesh. ALL Rohingyas have to pay for the crimes of a rebel group? Why? Especially from the army of a sovereign nation? Not to mention, the Myanmar military was ethnically cleansing ALL Rohingyas so that they leave Myanmar.

It's not right that the Myanmar government and its soldiers committed atrocities against the Rohingya people.

Life is a gift from God, and neither side in this conflict is right in murdering innocent men women and children, who are not combatants. My wish is that all sides in this conflict will sit down and come to some agreement that all sides can bear."

Juan Carlos Rodriguez La Santa,"This proves that religion and government should be divided. Religion should be used to foment your moral values and government to create the rules of society. If religion fails to teach good moral values you end destroying the society you want to create. A religion that speaks of segregation of the people based on religious belief should never be used as a means of government. No religion should be used ever as a means of government; period. A society without a central government will inevitably collapse. A society should be ruled based on rules that constitute the will of the people of that society; named a constitution. They ruled themselves by Islam and the price of ruling themselves by religion is, the collapse of what they want to accomplish. You either take a religious book to rule a country or make a constitution that is fair and up to date, to create a society. Islam does not respect life. What kind of society do you want to create with a religion that is so divided? Not even a chaotic society, because religions are made of rules that are too stiff and depend on the belief that changes from person to person. On one side religion impose ruling by obeying a supreme being, whose rules written in a book, may come from a supreme being or from a bunch of murderers, thieves, sexual predators, criminals, or psychopaths. On the other side, a constitution is made by people with objective thinking and moral values, that encompass the needs of every individual in a civilization. The reason why society can not be ruled by religion."

Bangladesh has given shelter to a number of refugees that many European and wealthier nations have objected to provide shelter for the forceful displaced people around the world. Bangladesh has done It's part more than expected simultaneously dealing with several other national calamities being one of the most natural disaster risk prone countries. The global community should acknowledge the fact and thereby facilitate repatriation of the Rohingya people to their homeland in Myanmar.

1275783508 Thanga,"Myanmar Muslims have well established Mosques and temples and most of them are in central Burma. They speak Burma's official language Burmese language very well. So called Rohingya Muslims are simply illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. 


---- Most of them are descendants of Bangladesh Vs Pakistan war refugees in 1970s. Most of them are anti-establishment of Bangladesh and sympathizers of the united East and West Pakistan nation. 

----- Rohingya of Bangladesh migrants are trying to be recognized as one of Burma's ethnic nationals instead of going through the law of the land. That kind of falsifying claim and campaign backfired their dream to come true, and even lost the possibility to get permanent residency. 

--- Muslims around the world should learn that false claim doesn't work anymore in this social network era and please start telling the truth that will help your daily status and will earn compassion of other religions! Nobody likes liars (by nothing concerned to religion) but the liars themselves. 

---- PS: India and Bangladesh intelligence communities intercepted three long phone call between high ranking Pakistan intelligent officer and leader of ARSA (Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army) before ARSA terrorist group attacks at 30 Burma security outposts on August 25, 2017. 

---- Now those people again become refugees between wars against terrorist ARSA. Victims of lies!"
