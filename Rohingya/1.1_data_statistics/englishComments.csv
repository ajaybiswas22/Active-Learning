Emon Rahman,"The Rohingya people are a stateless Indo-Aryan-speaking people who reside in Rakhine State, Myanmar. In 1989, the junta officially changed the name of Burma to Myanmar. In the 1990s, the junta changed the name of the province of Arakan to Rakhine State, which showed a bias towards the Rakhine community, even though the Rohingya formed a substantial part of the population. The name of the region was historically known as Arakan for centuries. The Rohingya population is concentrated in the historical region of Arakan, an old coastal country of Southeast Asia. It is not clear who the original settlers of Arakan were. Burmese nationalist claims that the Rakhine inhabited Arakan since 3000 BCE are not supported by any archaeological evidence. By the 4th century, Arakan became one of the earliest Indianized kingdoms in Southeast Asia. The first Arakanese state flourished in Dhanyawadi. Power then shifted to the city of Waithali. Sanskrit inscriptions in the region indicate that the founders of the first Arakanese states were Indian. Arakan was ruled by the Chandra dynasty. Following the Konbaung Dynasty's conquest of Arakan in 1785, as many as 35,000 people of the Rakhine State fled to the neighbouring Chittagong region of British Bengal in 1799 to escape persecution by the Bamar & to seek protection under the British Raj. The Bamar executed thousands of men & deported a considerable portion of people from Rakhine population to central Burma, leaving Arakan a scarcely populated area by the time the British occupied it. According to an article on the ""Burma Empire"" published by the British Francis Buchanan-Hamilton in 1799, ""the Mohammedans, who have long settled in Arakan"", ""call themselves Rooinga, or natives of Arakan"". However, according to Derek Tokin, Hamilton no longer used the term to refer to the Muslims in Arakan in his later publications. The numbers & the extent of post-independence immigration from Bangladesh are subject to controversy & debate. In a 1955 study published by Stanford University, the authors Virginia Thompson & Richard Adloff write, ""The post-war (World War II) illegal immigration of Chittagonians into that area was on a vast scale, & in the Maungdaw & Buthidaung areas they replaced the Arakanese."" The authors further argue that the term Rohingya, in the form of Rwangya, first appeared to distinguish settled population from newcomers: ""The newcomers were called Mujahids (crusaders), in contrast to the Rwangya or settled Chittagonian population."" According to the International Crisis Group (ICG), these immigrants were actually the Rohingyas who were displaced by World War II & began to return to Arakan after the independence of Burma but were rendered as illegal immigrants, while many were not allowed to return. ICG adds that there were ""some 17,000"" refugees from the Bangladesh liberation war who ""subsequently returned home"". A separate administrative zone for the Rohingya-majority northern areas of Arakan existed between 1961 & 1964. Known as the Mayu Frontier District, the zone was set up by Prime Minister U Nu after the 1960 Burmese general election, on the advice of his health minister Sultan Mahmud. The zone was administered directly from Rangoon by the national government. After the Burmese military coup in 1962, the zone was administered by the Burmese army. It was transferred to the Ministry of Home Affairs in 1964 by the Union Revolutionary Council. The socialist military government inducted the zone into Arakan State in 1974. Racism towards people with links to the Indian subcontinent increased after the 1962 Burmese coup. The socialist military government nationalized all property, including many enterprises of the white collar Burmese Indian community. Between 1962 & 1964, 320,000 Burmese Indians were forced to leave the country. As a result of Operation King Dragon by the Burmese junta, the first wave of Rohingya refugees entered Bangladesh in 1978. An estimated 200,000 Rohingyas took shelter in Cox's Bazaar. Diplomatic initiatives over 16 months resulted in a repatriation agreement, which allowed the return of most refugees under a process facilitated by UNHCR. The return of refugees to Burma has been the second largest repatriation process in Asia after the return of Cambodian refugees from Thailand. In 1982, the citizenship law enacted by the Burmese military junta did not list the Rohingya as one of the 135 national races of Burma. This made much of the Rohingya population in Burma stateless in their historical homeland of Arakan. After Burmese military junta began persecuting the political opposition following Aung San Suu Kyi's victory in the 1990 election & the earlier 1988 Uprising,or 8-8-88 Uprising, military operations targeting Muslims (who strongly favored the pro-democracy movement) began in Arakan State. The Rohingya-led NDPHR political party was banned & its leaders were jailed. Suu Kyi herself was placed under house arrest by the junta led by General Than Shwe. As the Burmese military increased its operations across the country, the Maungdaw, Buthidaung & Rathedaung townships in northern Arakan became centers of persecution. The 23rd & 24th regiments of the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Army) were responsible for promoting forced labour, rape, the confiscation of houses, land & farm animals, the destruction of mosques, a ban on religious activities & the harassment of the religious priests. An estimated 250,000 refugees crossed over into Bangladesh. Both Bangladesh & Burma mobilized thousands of troops along the border during the crisis. The government of Bangladesh emphasized a peaceful resolution of the crisis. After diplomatic negotiations, a repatriation agreement was put in place to allow the return of refugees to Burma under a UNHCR-supervised process. The Rohingya have faced military crackdowns in 1978, 19911992, 2012, 2015 & 20162017. On 22 October 2017, the UN reported that an estimated 603,000 refugees from Rakhine, Myanmar, had crossed the border into Bangladesh since August 25, 2017. This number increased to 624,000 by November 2, 2017 & over 625,000 by December 6, 2017. The majority are Muslim while a minority are Hindu. According to Human Rights Watch, under the 1982 Myanmar nationality law ""effectively deny to the Rohingya the possibility of acquiring a nationality"". Despite being able to trace Rohingya history to the 8th century, Myanmar law does not recognize the ethnic minority as one of the eight ""national indigenous races"". They are also restricted from freedom of movement, state education & civil service jobs.


The Rohingya community was recognized as an indigenous ethnic nationality of Burma, with members of the group serving as representatives in the Burmese parliament, as well as ministers, parliamentary secretaries & other high-ranking government positions. But since Burma's military junta took control of the country in 1962, the Rohingya have been systematically deprived of their political rights.",11,yRnWtbZv83w

They then botched up the border when retreating after WW2, leaving the rohingyas within a hostile fragmented Myanmar where they were constantly persecuted by the scumbag Myanmar army thereon. Also to those stating these people should go back to Bangladesh by that logic then the one million plus Burmese/ Myanmar origin people in Bangladesh should go back to Myanmar. Oh wait the Burmese/ Myanmar origin people in Bangladesh  are actually recognised as citizens in Bangladesh, allowed to go to school, vote etc despite  being against Bangladesh in its independance war in 1971.

View visions of a place Called peace that profoundly place a heart within me.
Rest soundly, share my dreams. 

Come into my village, to this hut clad in straw,  through it's door... 
Share my home....Share brown rats knawing bamboo flooring, 
Clawing in crevices for lone grains of rice, twice... 
Mistaking the tips of my toes for disposed seeds, 
My warm flesh supplying insatiable needs, 
Look close, see me bleed, stay here, share my poverty. 

Share chilled droplet dew, eloping from palm rooves... a pre-cursor to the monsoon.
Like Blood spots from Rangoon this moisture hangs waiting to swiftly awaken me.
Lay damp down Beside me... lie here....share my chill.

Share surprise as my eyes try to reach for the light, try to bleach out the night, but... remain Tightly shut as I strain to prise lashes matted closed with the ashes of sandlewood Fires ...that kept me warm in the twilight, then lost that fight by dawn's plight, stay blind... Share my darkness.


Feel the sun try to warm me, feel its beams rudely storm me,  and though
They can't warn Me, too soon they shall mourn me...
Stay here, share that morning.

Share the bark of  my dog, smell the fear in his eyes as he strains at the vine chain,
Hear him Whimper then die as steel finds his neck, slices through fur,
Come friend..... hear the Darkness return to the cur.
Share the crack of a twig as large boots snap branchlets and rifles are
Shouldered to tare up my hamlet with voluntary violence and flames that engulf, stay still share my horror, hold your Breath, share my truth.
Share  the rage at my side, as the first fist impacts me, know the bruise as it swells, Like the Shadows around me, watch them pile into Kadir, at two he's the youngest, the lightest, The babe, the infant, the sweetest. share disgust as his skin swiftly sucks in the blade, share Blood gushing from him, be shocked, be affraid, as he flies like a football on the end of a Kick,  then lies limp like a hooked fish being beaten by sticks,
 Don't you dare look away now,  stay Here,share my guilt.
Share the laughter of strangers as they turn on my sister, share her spluttering cries as they line up to kiss her, as they rip at her torso, like wolves in a pack, don't you dare turn away now, feel This brutal attack. share the facts as they happen, in colour 3d, not through your Tv, your smart phone, your pc.

 Stay here, suffer with me, look on share my rage.
Share screams as my hair is being torn from my skull, share the drain on my courage as it Seeps from my soul, share urine now running down a teenagers legs, Mouth pleas as I Blubber, I cower, I beg, Share howells from my mother being dragged through the dirt, taste the salt in her teardrops, wallow helpless in her hurt as her daughter is raped like a ragdoll before her and is left here to die, share real fear as it stuns her.
Share My eyes as they falter with a short final breath, stating ""I am Rohingja"", be here ...share my death.
Share in my wish, that ethnic cleansing won't last, let it surf from this tide of distopian iconoclasts, who crave for ideals that their lands should be pure, share this mortal's dismay  as destruction  endures.
Share the prize of a lady, share her gold centrepiece, she won it for freedom, she won it for peace, But now she says nothing as my race is  erased, share my people uprooted,denied and Displaced. Share in the silence of Aung San Suu Kyi, share in the violence her hypocracy Brought me, I am Rohingja and Myanmar haunts me.
Stay here as I die, share this hell as it taunts me.

Share my dreams, as I sleep, 
Share dreams buried deep in this childs perished frame, my name........ was Ayesha, I was your host, I am Rohingja,  Myanmar's ghost.

Demon Slayer,"This topic is still debated in INdia as the Norther-eastern part of India is still affected by a sort of misrepresentation of identity. Not because we're trying to chase people away but these group of people who happed to called ""Mias"" here seem to representing the ethnic indigenous people here and have distorted the history. 
To understand this, we really need to go back to the history about the formation of the Bengal state under the British GOvt and the creation of East Pakistan. 
So just to mention the gist of it, the Region of Bangladesh did not have these ""Rohingya"", ""Mia"" or ""Bengali"" population as an ethnicly indigenous group. Even now in Bangladesh they do recognise Communities such as ""Mechs"", ""Kochs"", ""GAros"", ""Jaintias"", ""Chakmas"", as the indigenous of the Country/region.
That is why these people cannot claim citizenship as a historically indigenous community, which they happen to most often do. However, other forms which are cosidered legal forms of claiming citizen are always tolerated surely in Myanmar and definitely in India. 
All of these confusions starts with the communal Hindu-Muslim conflicts and the reason for the Muslims' needing to creat a seperate country for themselves. This is a sad reality but, all of us, i'm sure who border this country of Bangladesh, surely cannot understand why theire fraternised populas has been fleeing their country which they formed inorder to safeguard their religious community.",1,5bDgDiBO4Co

Look at them, they are indistinguishable from Bangla Deshis too.
Its unfortunate that the genuine Rohingya became victims of their brethren from across the sea.
A few hundred have been accepted back into Myanmar.
There are ""Rohingya"" refugees that has indicated that they will refuse to go back into Myanmar. 
The term Rohingya refugee is advantages to those people, and the United Nations in sorting out the crisis.
Those Bengalis have no home. Their mud flats of the delta region in Bangla Desh  has been washed away by climate change. Bangla Desh don't want to  take responsibility for them. The country is over populated. So for the UN its Myanmar.

Arakan and Bengal had a friendly relationship of Busines, Cultural ties, and people's movement for hundreds of years. We also have a well respected big community of Rakhine people in Bangladesh with Bangladeshi citizenship. All the problem happened after Burmese annexation of Arakan. British colonies made this problem even bigger by dividing countries with an ethnic and religious line. Simple we can say Rohingya people, and their land is wrong borderline. Northern Arakan should be included in Bangladesh or Arakan itself should be one single country as it was historically.  Finally, modern-day countries can not be based on only one language, religion or ethnic group. Everyone should live peacefully and respect the fellow human being regardless of their ethnicity, belief, and language. We should search for the strength in unity and diversity. Rather than destroying the Rohingya community Myanmar should use this community to develop its economic and cultural relations with Bangladesh and the Muslim world!

The Rohingya issue has a past which most don't know. In 1942 they were given greater provincial control of Rakhine province by the British in exchange for support in WW 2. They had then suppressed the local Buddhists........it's only that things have come a full circle and that they are on the recieving end now.

Also, the protector of the Rohingyas...i.e. the Arakan National Army which has fought with the Tadatmaw throughout, has links with the ISI( Pakistan) and Islamic state extremists. Their leader is a Pakistani national funded by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. 

India has never in it's history deported refugees, but we have deported Rohingyas precisely because of the extremist threat which we are already dealing with on our western and Eastern borders.

So basically, stop being idiotic liberals who start shouting about human rights at any opportunity they have....America has enough of those idiots . The world has complex geopolitical issues...understand the whole story and come to a conclusion....you'll realize that the world isn't as is portrayed by half ass journalists who dont have the interest neither the attention span to come to the truth.

They must show some documents or proof that they have been living in Myanmar since before the beginning of the crisis. Also, these Rohingyas don't want to return to Myanmar and very few have returned since the government starts accepting them. Our country is very poor.
Myanmar can grant them citizenship but do not accept them as one of the ethnic groups. We have Chinese, Indians, Muslims, Armenians, in our country as well. They are citizens but not ethnic groups.

In Rohingya language, the Rohingya people call Rakhine State 'Rahinya' or 'Rahingya'. And the Rohingya language is a branch of (70 to 80 per cent the same with) Chitagonian bangladeshi (bangali) dialect.
So to put it simple, the word Rohingya refers to the people of Rakhine State or the Rakhine State in this Bengali dialect. This term 'Rohingya' is the word used by the bangali or banglas who settled in Rakhine State to differentiate and show where they are from (to say that they are bangalis who settled in Rakhine State).

Shreemayi Dasgupta,"In my view Rohingyas are not persecuted based on religion. The issue dates back before India's independence. Most of them moved from  Chattagram district of undivided Bengal (now Bangladesh) to Arakan area of Myanmar (earlier BURMA). AS THE AREA BECAME A MUSLIM MAJORITY AREA , they started demanding partitioning of Myanmar to separate that area from Myanmar to form a separate MUSLIM STATE. THEY FORMED THEIR OWN ARMY AND FORCEFULLY TRIED TO ESTABLISH A NEW  ISLAMIC COUNTRY. They got support from some Muslim Fundamentalist group from  some Muslim countries. They also wanted support of MR.JINNAH but was not very successful as MR.JINNAH was busy partitioning India to create ISLAMIC STATE OF PAKISTAN. Myanmar government deployed army to tackle the ROHINGYA ARMY. Initially, the Myanmar army was not successful, but after reinforcement they defeated the Rohingya Army and drove them out of Myanmar. Hence, I don't find any ""religious persecution"" on the part of Myanmar Government in the case of Rohingya Muslims. THEY TRIED TO PARTITION MYANMAR AND HENCE, THEY WERE DRIVEN OUT. HENCE, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THEY WILL NOT JOIN THE SEPARATIST GROUPS IN INDIA AND WILL NOT BECOME A POTENTIAL SECURITY THREAT FOR INDIA. THEREFORE, THEY SHOULD BE SENT BACK TO MYANMAR OR BANGLADESH (AS THEY HAVE ENTERED INDIA THROUGH BANGLADESH) AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.",1,ZKvEtxJrL94

Now in order have eternal life Say this prayer: Lord Jesus Christ, today I receive you as my Lord and savior, forgive me of all my sins, I believe you died for me on the cross of Calvary so that I may not die in my sins. O Lord, write my name in the Lambs book of life.  Now get a bible, KJV and read it. Obey all the commandments of Jesus Christ. Your eternal security depends on this. You must confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe that God raised him from the dead and then you will be saved. Romans 10:9-10. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten  Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
SOME SCRIPTURES STATE BELLOW ABOUT JESUS CHRIST AS WRITTEN IN THE BIBLE
Colossians 2:9 - For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily Titus 2:13 - looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ Jesus Christ the faithful witness says in Revelation 1:8 - I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, says the Lord, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty. 1 Timothy 3:16 - And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, Justified in the Spirit, Seen by angels, Preached among the Gentiles, Believed on in the world, Received up in glory. Philippians 2:5-7 - Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bond-servant, and coming in the likeness of men.  1 Timothy 6:14-16 - our Lord Jesus Christ's appearing, which He will manifest in His own time, He who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see, to whom be honor and everlasting power. Amen.   Isaiah 9:6 - For unto us a Child is born, Unto us a Son is given; And the government will be upon His shoulder. And His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.  john 1:1-4 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.2 The same was in the beginning with God.3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.4  In him was life; and the life was the light of men.  John 1: 14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.  Psalms 45: 6-7 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre. Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.

The legislatures under Rockefeller's leadership set up the American League of Municipalities which controlled all the towns in the U.S., and the American Association of State Government which controlled the states. He used the state legislatures to draft new methods for controlling doctors and hospitals. All doctors and hospitals had to be licensed through the state legislature. You had to go through John D. Rockefeller to get a medical license and a hospital license. That's why we're put on medications for the rest of our lives. It's against the AMA procedures to cure anyone. You buy from the Rockefeller drug companies and go to the Rockefeller hospitals. They created Medicare and Medicaid to control the doctors and hospitals with taxpayer money so the drug companies can get the money for their drugs. The people who can't afford the drugs, our government, through our tax dollars pay for them. ""Murder By Injection,"" Eustace Mullins

Not only do they control the doctors, they control their education, here and all over the world.

( Be Just )

Quran 5:8
'' O you who believe! stand out firmly for God, as witnesses to fair dealing, and let not the > HATRED OF OTHERS TO YOU < make you swerve to wrong and depart from justice. Be just: that is next to piety: and fear God. For God is well-acquainted with all that ye do. ''

Quran 4:58
 '' Indeed, God commands you to render trusts to whom they are due and when you judge between people to judge with justice. Excellent is that which God instructs you. Indeed, God is ever Hearing and Seeing.''

( God's The Rules Of  War )

Quran 2:190
'' Fight in the way of God > THOSE WHO FIGHT YOU < but do not transgress. Indeed. God does not like transgressors. ''

Quran  2 :193 

 '' And fight them on until there is no more oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in God; but if they cease, Let there be no hostility except to those who practice oppression. ''

Quran 4:90
 ''.........So if they withdraw from you and cease their hostility and offer you peace, in that case Allah has not granted you permission to fight against them.''

Quran 8:61
''And if they seek peace, then you also seek it, and put your trust in God. He is the Hearer, the Knowledgeable.''

( Stand Up For Justice )

Quran 4 :135
 '' Ye who believe! stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to God, even as against > YOURSELVES, < or your parents, or your kin, and whether it be (against) rich or poor: for God can best protect both. Follow not the lusts (of your hearts), lest ye swerve, and if ye distort (justice) or decline to do justice, verily God is well-acquainted with all that ye do.''

( Who Are The Good Human Beings? )

Quran 2.177
'' Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but [true] righteousness is [in] one who believes in God, the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets and gives wealth,> IN SPITE OF LOVE FOR IT,< to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveler, those who ask [for help], and for freeing slaves; [and who] establishes prayer and gives charity; [those who] fulfill their promise when they promise; and [those who] are patient in poverty and hardship and during battle. Those are the ones who have been true, and it is those who are the righteous. ''

( Freedom To Believe And To Reject )

Quran 2:256
'' Let there be no compulsion in religion. Truth stands out clear from error ''

Quran 10:99
'' And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed - all of them entirely. Then would you compel the people in order that they become believers? ''

( Tolerance For Other Religions )

Quran 109: 1- 6

Say,""O disbelievers,

I do not worship what you worship.

Nor are you worshipers of what I worship.

Nor will I be a worshiper of what you worship.

Nor will you be worshipers of what I worship.

For you is your religion, and for me is my religion.""

( Protection for Idol Worshiper )

 Quran 9:6
 ""And if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that he may hear the words of Allah. Then deliver him to his place of safety. That is because they are people who do not know. ""

Quran16:125
Call people to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good teaching, and argue with them in the most courteous way

Quran7:199 Be tolerant....

( Friendship With Non Muslims )

Quran 60:8
'' God does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, God loves those who act justly. ''

( Do Christians And Jews and  ""OTHER"" non-Muslims go to Heaven? )

Quran 2:62
'' Those who believe (in the Qur'an), and those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), and the Christians and the Sabians,-> ANY <- who believe in God and the Last Day, and work righteousness, shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. '' ---> { On Judgement Day }

( According to the Quran Christians and Jews worship TRUE God )

(Quran 3:113-114)
'' Not all of them are alike: Of the People of the Book ( Christians and Jews ) are a portion that stand (For the right): They rehearse the Signs of God all night long, and they prostrate themselves in adoration. They believe in God and the Last Day; they enjoin what is right, and forbid what is wrong; and they hasten (in emulation) in (all) good works: They are in the ranks of the righteous.''

Note: According to the Quran that Jesus is not God nevertheless Christians still worship one '' TRUE '' God.
 
( Allah Is The Protector Of  Monasteries, Churches, Synagogues And The Mosques )

Quran 22:40
[They are] those who have been evicted from their homes without right - only because they say, ""Our Lord is God ."" And were it not that God checks the people, some by means of others, there would have been demolished monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which the name of God is much mentioned. And God will surely support those who support Him. Indeed, God is Powerful and Exalted in Might.

( Why  Are There So Many Different Religions In The World ? )

Quran 5 48
''...... If God wanted He could have made all of you a single nation. But He willed otherwise in order to test you in what He has given you;(scriptures) therefore try to excel one another in good deeds. Ultimately you all shall return to God; then He will show you the truth of those matters in which you > DISPUTE <.''

NOTE:
Quran 3:85
''If anyone desires a religion other than Islam ( > submission < to God), never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (All spiritual good)''

My explanation of above verse

Islam mean > submission < to God

( The above verse saying is that God will not accept a religion from the ""MUSLIM"" and the Non-Muslims but total > submission < to God.)

Question: How Can Muslim And the Non-Muslim > submit < to the God?

Answer: Be kind to other human beings and Do not lie, Do not steal, Do not cheat, Do not hurt others, Do not be prideful and Do the charity work.

 ( God Allow Muslims To Marry And Eat Food From the Christian And Jew And Vice Versa )

Quran 5;5
''This day [all] good foods have been made lawful, and the food of those who were given the Scripture ( Christian and Jew) is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them. And [lawful in marriage are] chaste women from among the believers and chaste women from among those who were given the Scripture ( Christian and Jew) before you, when you have given them their due compensation, desiring chastity, not unlawful sexual intercourse or taking [secret] lovers. And whoever denies the faith - his work has become worthless, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.''

( Kindness Toward Atheists / Apostate )

Quran 60:8
'' As for such [of the unbelievers( atheist)] as do not fight against you on account of [your] faith, and neither drive you forth from your homelands, God does not forbid you to show them kindness and to behave towards them with full equity: for, verily, God loves those who act equitably. ''

( All The Terrorists / Killers Will Enter Hell Fire )

 Quran 5:32
""......Whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely......""

( Turned Your Enemies Into Your Best Friends )

Quran 41:34
""The good deed and the evil deed are not alike. Repel the evil deed with one which is better, then lo! he, between whom and thee there was enmity (will become) as though he was a bosom friend.""

( The Husband and  The Wife Are > Protecting Friends < One Of Another )

Quran 9:71
''And the believers, men and women, are > Protecting Friends < one of another; they enjoin the right and forbid the wrong, and they establish worship and they pay the poor-due, and they obey God and His messenger. As for these, God will have mercy on them. Lo! God is Mighty, Wise.''

 Quran16:97
  To whoever, male or female, does good deeds and has faith, We shall give a good life and reward them according to the best of their actions. 

 Quran 30:21
  And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you > affection and mercy <--> { Love }

 The Prophet Muhammad said, Heaven lies under the feet of your mother.

( Human Are One family )

Quran 49:13
"" O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise (each other). Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of God is (he who is) the most righteous of you. And God has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things).""

( All The Racist People Will Enter Hellfire )

Quran 30:22
 ""And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the diversity of your languages and your colors. Indeed in that are signs for those of knowledge.""

My comment:

The > BASIC < message of God to the human is that '' YOU '' believe in God and be kind to other human beings / animals and in the > RETURNED < God will > REWARD < you with a new life in Paradise.

* The Quran ONLY guides you how to become a good human being ""Nothing Else"".

* You are a good  human being or a bad human being that is YOUR choice.

* No one can force you to become a good human being.

* You MUST work HARD to become a good human being.

* Why  should ''YOU'' do good deeds and avoid bad deeds?

* Do Good - it's for You. Do Bad - It's against you.

* '' YOUR'' life is a TEST from God that you will choose to do either Good or Bad.

* Find the excuse to help others and forgive others NOT the other way around.

* '' YOUR '' final destination is either Hell or Heaven.
.
* So work HARD toward choice of  YOUR destination.
.

With better living, food, education for the children, health, shelter, and some means to lead their livelihood involving agriculture. UN is not doing their part so far and not supporting these measures. Last three years more than a million Rohingyas just destroyed the ecology of Cox's Bazar and at the same time, the Rohingyas need to be relocated to a better place. In my opinion, most of the UN and NGO workers don't want to be relocated to a remote place as it will cut some of their personal benefits; presently they are living in the 5start hotels in the heart of the main touristic district of Bangladesh. At the same time, the UN and the world community have totally failed to create any pressure on to Myanmar govt to bring them back though.

Sky Watcher,"Things are far more complicated. Part also of the history was when the British was retreating from Arakan in WW2, they armed the Rohingya to fight off the Japanese when they reach the area.  The Rohingya however killed the local Burmese.  

As cited in the video, the Rohingyas came from India and Bangladesh (called Eastern Pakistan back then) to work for the British for agriculture and others. The Rohingya enjoyed favor from the British to ensure their loyalty, which they know they cannot expect from the Burmese who were against their colonization.  The Burmese were considered the bottom tier or lowest class in their own land

The Rohingya weren't an innocent victim at all.  In more recent years, they killed locals and attacked over 15 police stations and a military camp, killing policemen and soldiers. 

ARSA was the most recent rebel secessionist group they had. They issued videos resembling that of ISIS, Al Qaeda and Taliban, standing behind a flag with the speaker flanked by armed masked men.  

The ARSA can be partly blamed for the exodus of the Rohingya. They forget the Tatmadaw is a very fierce force to contend with. 

What sparked the public's anger was the rape and murder of a Burmese woman by 4 Rohingyas.  All hell broke loose after the incident.  

The Rohingya is a sad victim of history and Imperial Britain who did not fulfill their promise of a state of their own. They remain a stateless people to this day. 

The Rohingya still long to go back to Myanmar which they consider home.  Only Myanmar can give them hope.  One can only hope for reconciliation and a peaceful resolution to the Rohingya crisis.",6,w-3cT6pL75c

Nigrodha, you may think: The contemplative Gotama says that just to get more disciples. But you shouldnt think that way. May your master remain your master. 

Or you may think: He wants us to abandon our rules. But you shouldnt think that way. May your rules remain the same. 

Or you may think: He wants us to abandon our way of life. But you must not think that way. May your way of life remain the same. 

Or you might think: He wants us to do things that according to our teaching are wrong and are considered by us to be. But you shouldnt think that way. May those things that you think are wrong continue to be considered that way. 

Or you may think: He wants to keep us from those things that according to our teaching are correct and are considered by us to be like this. But you shouldnt think that way. May those things that you think are right continue to be considered that way. Nigrodha, I do not speak due to any of these causes ...




There are, Nigrodha, awkward things that have not been abandoned, contaminated, that lead to rebirth, terrifying, that produce painful results in the future, associated with birth, aging and death. It is for the abandonment of these things that I teach Dhamma. 
If you practice accordingly, these contaminated things will be abandoned, and the things that lead to purification will develop and increase, and you will achieve and remain, performing for yourself in the here and now the fullness of the perfection of wisdom.  (DN 25)",0,2YUzH6gJ8aw

Suu Kyi has two decades of sacrifice .. endured punishment.. walked the talk.

The criticism as mentioned by the man in the video.. should be targeted at the Generals who are using Suu Kyi as a scape goat.. with the intent of saying . there it happened on her watch. These generals are pure evil.. and have duped the outside world yet again.. By the way the outside world states.. non govt organisations have sat idly by for six decades whilst the Burmese people were subjected to rape.. murder.. torture.. and jail... but did NOTHING. Now they want to blame Suu Kyi .. who has with no assistance from the outside world .. fought the Junta for two decades, hence, her numerous human rights awards. Then leaders in the West.. UK and US led the charge of praising Suu Kyi for having bought Burma to a democracy.. when Suu Kyi .. was trying to calm the hysteria and explain.. that Burma was merely in transition to democracy and had a long way to go. But no. ... on they went ignoring the ethnic conflicts.. ignoring that twenty five percent and proxy or rogue govt soldiers out of uniform made up even more seats in the parliament. Suu Kyi's role was and is a benign one.. as any changes for instance to the badly designed constitution can not be undertaken unless the military approve. The military can also appoint members to parliament and take them out.. unless they consent with the govt. The outside world are doing the Junta's job for them ... The Junta has left Suu Kyi to confront the Hague. defend them... and just sit back immune to criticism. IN other words the gravitas of exigencies in Burma are not understood or grasped by other nation states. And now Gambia with human rights abuses of its own.. joins with other Muslim states to take the charge of genocide to the Hague.  Really...so terrorism is to be snuffed out in other nation states.. but not in Burma. This is a Muslim star chamber who have colluded to use the ethnic crisis in Burma to band together with the Islamic community in Burma many of whom are moderates. It is astounding how inept the international so-called political scientists and analysts are.. completely out of their depth. Suu Kyi meanwhile is once again left holding the bag... her transition to democracy undermined at every turn. Really, pick one world leader who could match her record on human rights... Trump.. or the UK idiot Boris.. whatever his name is.. what about their war crimes .. far worse. If they argue that Suu Kyi is guilty by association.. then they too are guilty by saying and doing nothing for six decades which is far worse..

This was in fact, the Military's intention from the outset  when it formed a parliament and allowed for a general election to take place in 2015. By allowing the NLD to win government it managed to stay in the background and divert both domestic and international criticism away from them whilst the incumbent government took on the responsibility for running the nation. Naturally, as Aung San Suu Kyi said herself, the responsibility falls on their shoulders and so of course they will be criticised harshly not only by the International Community for not living up to the ideals they once espoused but by the people of Burma themselves when they discover that their nation has not moved ahead as promised. The strange thing is that Aung San Suu Kyi knew fully well that her hands would be tied somewhat as both a politician and leader of a nation whose constitution is a farce and whose real power still rests with the Military establishment and yet she went ahead with it, regardless. She must now hold her tongue and pay tribute to them because she has 'sold her soul to the Devil' so to speak.

Of course she is unable to stop it.. Does anyone (well of course a lot of idiots) of any intelligence really think she fought for two decades... would throw it all away.. and suddenly abandon her ethics.. does her sacrifices have no utility. Oxford university counsel - Canada - Amnesty international ought to be ashamed.. and condemned for this shameful withdrawal of her human rights awards. Why is it these so-called exemplars of efficacy were no where to be found for six decades of oppression. Ethnic conflict has occurred in Burma for thousands of years.... to blame an iconic figure like Suu Kyi is reprehensible .. and decries any hope for mankind. How dare these people who have never spent a a day or a week in Burma pontificate in such an indifferent and ignorant manner.. how dare they carp like hypocrites with their bandwagon mentality. They all ran to be in the photo so to speak when she took the people of Burma to winning an election.. but were absent when the real struggle of two decades.. and five decades for the people was all too apparent. Burma was the silent country.. not just within.. but outside too...the international non govt organizations and leaders were acting as though they were impotent.. did nothing to stop the atrocities of the military junta... and now they have the audacity to blame a seventy one year old lady.

Pls go teach those media vultures who lack total knowledge in politics in Myanmar. It is also worth noting the foolishness in attacking Md. Suu Kyi as a practising Buddhist and taking Buddhism as the measure as yardstick. Oil and water do not mix and even the wisest man will act according to the event and circumstances, the compassionate Lord Buddha said. The call to strip her off the Nobel Peace prize is also telling us the the media is sensationalising this issue to make a quick buck and arouse the audience. In short the media capitalize on peoples' / nation's misery to make news. Do they understand the politics and events leading to the awarding of the Nobel Peace prize?

Truth Over Happiness,"Khaleefah Abdul-Majid I, declared his intention to send 10,000 to aid Ireland's farmers. However, Queen Victoria intervened and requested that the Sultan send only 1,000 because she had sent only 2,000 herself.

So theSultansent only the 1,000, but he also secretly sent five ships full of food. The English courts attempted to block the ships, but the food arrived in Drogheda harbor and was left there by Ottoman sailors. That 10,000 that the Sultan pledged to the Irish would be worth approximately 800,000 ($1.7m) today.

It's a wonderful story.

The movie, still in post-production, is built around this charitable act from a Muslim country to a Christian nation, separated by 4,000 miles. At the time the Ottoman Empire was experiencing enormous internal difficulty, but the Sultan Khaleefah Abdul-Majid was determined to help the starving men and women of Ireland. A friendship between two different cultures was formed. In the movie, a Turkish sailor meets an Irish farm girl and she finds herself torn by her emotions.",0,ZosTP9BJ-Hk

If these people had a little of human in them they wouldn't be standing around with  cameras but helping the people and trying to rescue the people that are injured or hurt or lost there lives,there are mothers,fathers burned alive people are running for there lives why don't all the movie directors go and make a movie there right now so people can get the real truth!!!

Hikarinx,"Everywhere I search up Rohinjyas in Burma, all I see are one sided news. You're a news network, at least do your job right and stop being so biased and reporting only from one side. This all started with the Rohinjya terrorist group in Burma called Harakah al Yakin. This terrorist group made up of Rohinjyas attacked government security forces in October 2016 resulting in 40 deaths excluding civilians. They attacked more government posts again in November 2016, more casualties and deaths followed. The terrorist group would bomb these posts and then storm in with a large number of people and slice the necks of whoever was still alive. Also they didn't only target the Burmese people when it came to these brutal murders, they also targeted Hindus and anyone else who was not of their religion. Aung San Suu Kyi has protected the Burmese people even when it meant herself being locked up for decades. She will continue protecting the people no matter the criticism she receives. She is receiving criticism, because these news stations can't see the whole picture, reports one-sidedly, and are brainwashing people.

Then they will no longer be a religion of peace. but if they don't kill that other religion of peace... That religion of peace is going to eliminate all religions. Just to show us how peaceful they really are. it's a conundrum. only the most peaceful will win. or lose",4,wuogyqaQhHQ

Please make sure that you are using the correct information before explaining the Bangali (so far called themselves as Rohingya) issue. Myanmar is ethnic diversity country which living with 135 ethnicities. You claim that the Bangali do not have food and Medicine. In fact, the 69 INGO include UNHCR, WFP, SCI helping bangali in Rakhaine state. As a poor country, Myanmar could not provide every of them. Myanmar government provide them the citizenship to some of the Bangali (Rohingya)  people and as well as called ""white Card"" that have the equal right to vote in the election. So, three of Bangali have sat in Parliment as MPs in the previous government. when the government offer them citizen to Bangali, but they do deny with this because they can not accept the name of Bangali. they calim to become one of the ethnicity in myanmar rather than became citizenship. Please read the ethnicity law in constitution.

No amount of change in the Government will undo what has already been done ... to send them back is to send them essentially to be exploited and killed at the end. Just accept the fact this cant be done... It would be far better for the rohingyas to find permanent stay at some other place ... either in Bangladesh or in the developed world where they would get the chance to live a free life.

Farhad Faisal,"Why not also report about the safety and sustainability measures that are already taken in Bhasan Char against any potential storm surge etc.? Also, why not hear the Rohingyas, who have already arrived in Bhasan Char, about how they themselves think (rather than only the UN and international NGO etc.'s view from a distance) about the safety and the living conditions in Bhasan Char? If these were done, the reporting could have been a lot better.

Sadly, so far, the UN, the international NGOs, and the international human rights organizations etc. have failed to oblige Myanmar to take back the nearly a million Rohingya refugees (who were violently ""ethnically cleansed"" out of Myanmar in 2017 and escaped in safety across the border into Bangladesh).

In spite of its own resource constrains, Bangladesh has been most generous in giving the Rohingyas protection and shelter. The Bangladesh government as well as the Bangladeshi NGOs are doing their best to help the Rohingya refugees now for years. The refugees are mostly saying in Cox's Bazar district in over crowed camps and most recently more than a thousand of them are moved in a spacious and well built new township in the island of Bhasan Char in the adjacent Bay of Bengal. It has been protected by high dams and high shelters against any plausible storm surge from the Bay of Bengal based on the records of the last hundred and fifty years.

The international community ought to, instead of hesitating, now enact international measures (diplomatic, economic etc.) that would compel Myanmar to take back the Rohingya refugees to their homes in Myanmar and, to ensure their physical safety, to regain (or compensate for) their destroyed property and, finally, to restore their rights as citizens of Myanmar.",14,QDgkFvzy6vg

And foreign NGOs are against the relocation because their key employees will lose their lavish lifestyle in the 5 star hotels in chittagong and coxes bazar.",69,QDgkFvzy6vg

You would think that the BBC and Economist would catch on when every interview I've seen so far is in a Bengali dialect, not in Burmese. This is really Bangladesh's problem, and its an example of what is to come when countries can not or will not control their population growth and environmental degradation. Local people seek to flee to less populated areas, regardless of national boundaries. This condition will worsen in years to come with more advanced climate change.

Theres a few muslimmen in Rakhine kingdom of Rakhine people  and they r know as kamein muslims ( who got ethnic in myanmar), n some Arab trade men n some  Bengali) . You have left out about ethnic Rakhine . Arakan or Rakhine ethnic  is Rakhine buddhists land . In 1824 after first Anglo Burmese war ,  Burmese king lost Rakhine  to British . British imported mass Bengali into Rakhine ( their census showed how much they imported Bengali for cheap labour. Then second wave is in 1971( when there was bengladesh liberation war from Pakistan) . This mass Bengali muslims entered into myanmar is well mentioned in British record. During japan invasion , when British retreated in 1942, British armed Bengali muslims to defend for British . But instead Bengali Muslim  did massacred Rakhine ethnic people ( est50000) . They  looted more than 100 Rakhine  villages , n since then they continue  terrosism under the  namemujahideen , now  changed name to ARSA.they even created fake ethnic name Rohingya in 1951)  n planned to seize Rakhine ethnic land .",2,Q89BxDBBNSY

Rohingya is not an ethnic,they are Bangali( immigrated from 
Bangladesh).But their motherland's government (Bangladesh) don't want to
 accept them back. There is no problem if they love different cultures 
(especially buddhists' culture) and want to coexist peacefully. But 
their birth rate is increasing rapidly and ambitiously. Now, there are 25,553 Rakhine nationals and 444,390 Bangalis 
living in Maungdaw,and 46,192 nationals and 230,000 Bangalis in 
Butheedaung. Now, they make an ethnic name and claim for citizenship but
 they deny Myanmar's Citizenship law as  they realize there is no 
possibility of acquiring a nationality. So, they start islamization and 
exploiting Myanmar Crisis with Fake,fabricated by the help of muslim 
countries and wastren medias(like OIC and UN,etc..).A lot of burmese 
buddhist girls murder and rapes  by Rohingyas (Bangali) muslim for a 
long time. But I never seen about that on any medias. Why? Simple, Most 
of the countries on the world are Islamic countries. We coexisting with 
our christian ethnic like Karen, Kachen, Chin without any religious 
problems. Myanmar have a lot 
of foreign immagrants like indians, Napalese, Chinese and so on. We are 
coexisting with them without any problems for a long time. Why? They 
respect our cultures and don't claim for citizenship and ethnic. They 
don't want to invade our land.That is why~~and why? why???? Why did they
 destroy buddhism's honour and image? But I still loving our minority 
myanmar muslim brothers not immigrated Bangali. May all beings free from

The world is chaotic shxt right now and will probably stay that way for a long time but IMO if minority groups, ANY minority group (regardless of creed or religion) know no discrimination...If this day ever comes, then this might be the beginning of a more civilised/harmonious world!!

It clearly states that one in three souls in that region are Musulmans of Rohingya origin. The term existed back in 1799.

Ab by,"Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples:The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses seat.So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach.They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other peoples shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.
Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long;they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called Rabbi by others.
But you are not to be called Rabbi, for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.And do not call anyone on earth father, for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah.The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted"".

You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything, in Heaven above or in the Earth beneath, or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents up to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.

If my people who are called by my name, humble themselves and pray, AND TURN FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS, I will hear from Heaven, will forgive their sins, and will heal their land.

And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standingin the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father,who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.And when you pray, do not keep on babblinglike pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you needbefore you ask him.

This, then, is how you should pray:

Our Fatherin heaven,
hallowed be your name,
your kingdomcome,
your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts,
as we also have forgiven our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from the evil one.

For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.

These are the teachings,
The Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ our God.
REPENT, and start doing what is right.
If you abide my teachings, you are really my disciples; then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.

A time is coming and has now come, that the true worshipers will worship the Father in Spirit and Truth. God is Spirit, so his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and Truth; they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.

In the New Heaven and New Earth,
only Righteousness dwells.

A certain amount of credit ( will ensure) others will speak out. If soldiers who carried out these heanus orders are too scared to come forward then the chances of a mass defection are decreased. This is a good start - and if good intell can be gotten.. then the two soldiers ought to have their sentences reduced - it is important they are not vilified for following orders. The real culprits are the Junta - Generals in charge. Indeed, the West could offer safe haven (but still hold them accountable within the law) to all those who choose to escape the military. It has happened in the past that many low and higher ranked military have fled Burma across the border seeking sanctuary.",0,8hRIoS7WFgk

Ab by,"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.

This, then, is how you should pray:

Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your name,
your kingdom come,
your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts,
as we also have forgiven our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from the evil one.

For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.

They saw it as an opportunity to wrest back power and return to the repressive ways of ten years ago and before. A lack of solidarity - a vulgar hubris by the powers that be... Oxford Uni.. Canada.. South Korea and certain groups in the US... have seen the fall from grace of Suu kyi - but more importantly undermined the transition to democracy. This reckless abandonment of solidarity and recognition of decades of effort and sacrifice - just beggar belief.. Shame on ""London school of Economics"" - ""Oxford St Hughes College - Bob Geldoff - Amnesty international - Gwyey you human rights South korea - ""Elie Wiesal awards"" - US  - Freedom of city award from Oxford - and those who bestowed then reneged on the Honorary Canadian Citizenship. You all have blood on your hands.

Abdul Rashid,"I feel, when democratic elected leader was in place, she ignored the plea of Rohingya people even supported her military in Hage court. At the time the Maynmar was with both Aun sang suki & the junta who both didn't not make any attempt to repatriate the Rohingyan people. Now that the military under pressure or not is willing to repatriate them, all of a sudden the whole country is a fan of the Rohingyan people. Was the whole nation asleep when the genocide was being committed? no one saw any demonstration for the Rohingya protection when the genocide was taking place. Hence the perception of safety net from both democratic elected gov & the military who committed genocide is removed & can not be trusted. 
Therefore the USA senators decision sounds much safer for the Rohingya than to trust any of them. At present Aun sang Suki supported are pretending to like the Rohingyan people so is the military. Military or Aun sang suki are no better than other when it come to atrocities against the Rohingya people, presently they are both using Rohingya as a political benefit as the wold has support for Rohingya.",23,OLCof3wyO9o

Uncle Chinsyou,"Myanmar has been suffering for centuries; first under British Colonialism, when the nation was placed inside Greater India, thus around 8 millions immigrants moved into small homogeneous country in long Colonial era; secondly through boycotted by the West, as impoverished Myanmar turned to Socialism for a relief. In fact, Myanmar has a sad saying that goes 'A poor young girl got raped and get hurt twice', referring to their nation's double tragedies. This on going crisis in Myanmar is product of Colonialism, when the nation was placed inside Greater India, thus around 8 millions immigrants poured into small homogeneous country in long Colonial era, including Rohingya Bengalis from populous but tiny Bangladesh which has a population of 170 million, that had been sending millions of illegal immigrants into Myanmar for ages that Myanmar has declared national emergency in Rakhine State ever since early 1980s, but Western news medias ignored it all, as Myanmar had been boycotted by the West, when impoverished country turned to Socialism after long painful Colonial era; and as a result, hardly any one out of Myanmar knew truths. It's all about Colonial masters & their South Asians they used as soldiers & servants to defend Colonial Empire worldwide, while master extracted wealth for centuries; and territorial expansion into next door Myanmar through immigration, which eventually end up a small homogeneous country, paying ultimate prices. Myanmar endured the worst immigration onslaught under long & painful Colonialism, when several million immigrants poured in, as small homogeneous country was put inside Greater India; while neighbors such as Laos, Cambodia & Vietnam under French Colonialism had no immigration issue at all. Like I said, there's hardly any Muslim, Hindu or Christian in Myanmar up until Colonialism, when the small homogeneous country was placed inside Greater India, and several millions South Asian immigrants poured in; while neighbors such as Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam under French Colonialism had no immigration issue at all.

Myanmar government must follow the international laws and should take care of everyone with love.

ÿßŸÖ ÿßÿ≠ŸÖÿØ,"This video is old, but today I saw behind you in you, you are just an agent and mercenary agent from the government of Myanmar and defend it without the truth and you are not a definition of Rohingya history and its glory because we are from the original inhabitants of Arakan for thousands of centuries and our ancestors were of Hinduism and descendants a people  (Ariana ) and after the religion of Islam came, we embraced the doctrine of Islam 1440 years ago, (alhamdu lillah) we were peacefully living in each other (Muslim and Rakhine Mugh) and in 1484 AD and invaded and occupied the King of Burma (in Dubia) greed for Arakan's wealth because it is full of rivers 7 torments and the seashore bay with a transit  And the sea port of agricultural resources, breathtaking views, and the Amazon in Talal Hamalia, mineral, gases, petroleum and their agonies, and after the number of wars they killed and usurped thousands and after those who remained forced and displaced the Muslims and Rakhineh (Mog) who stayed to bangal( India )and after the occupation they returned to the Arakan this period  The role of (doush) after a British occupation came. We were a follower of British rule. 
As for what about the Muslims of Myanmar, do they see Arakan all over Myanmar?  And you don't know what happened in the capital Rangoon and Mandalay in 1912 (Indian)muslin schools and mosques were burnt and they are not Rohingya muslins !  And the second behavior that corruption erupted due to some Rohingya youth raped a Buddhist girl. This is a great accusation, and it is a shame for the truth because the Myanmar government made an anti-Rohnji film because the evidence and evidence is very clear that before the incident, the President of Myanmar (Tin Sen) Rohingy declared that he is not a citizen of Myanmar and  They deported them to other countries who love them!  In 2011 and a year later, with a bloody and bloody plan, the ten killings of Muslims were reported, and they have nothing to do with politicians, and lastly, I ask you to inform the Rohingya history and do not defend the murderer and criminal the fascist dictator so that you are not criminals,

By Grace alone...faith alone...threw Christ alone. Christ shed his blood to cover our sins to make us clean. We're all sinners in a need of a savior. Hell  is real and you DON'T want to spend eternal there. 


Don't delay. Please wake from your worldly slumber. Take a moment to look around not just in your local area, but all over the world. So many events in scripture is happening before our eyes; these events all over, are impossible to ignore; please take the time to research and discern for yourself that we are INDEED in the end of times, the end of grace. Please except Jesus Christ as your Lord and savior while it's a gift of grace of faith alone. Please don't be the one who needs to see his presence/return to accept him. 
It's not to late, but the time is running out for the church rapture, and the events to come, as stated in the Bible. We all sin, and we sin differently than others, However we all my MUST repent the same and accept him the same. Build that relationship with God & Jesus as they're your ONLY FiRST love. Society has condemned those who struggle if they're or not good enough to enter the kingdom of heaven. God & Jesus love you so much and is waiting for that relationship, to have eternal life with you. Just by faith alone. Jesus paid that ultimate sacrifice, (willingly) and is waiting. Just take a moment to just think about it. May God bless and keep you! ",0,EM5zwTUi73o

The right to abortion of a raped woman is claimed loudly, but the movie reminds me of the ""Annunciation"" painting, which makes me realize the preciousness of giving birth.

Read the history for yourself, evaluate the facts and connect the dots (if you have an open mind on the subject); don't rely on the falsehoods propagated by imams and maulvis to shield their own agenda from scrutiny.

Is India best place for more and more people ? here people are already suffering from over population and lack of infrastructure . BBC should report on problem of over population . also when some one is detained he must have committed some serious crime . otherwise why only 2000 people in jail not the 4 million who are not in NRC  list.. This is why BBC news is biased .you make news based only on one side to fulfill your own agenda . I agree to the people who commented here . Also I can see BBC smartness to film the bangladesh issue on a Hindu detainee guy to invoke  sentiments of the majority people . very pathetic when media 's work  only for propaganda,2,UZ0FsF2M6hg

Jayde Moe,"The talk was pretty convincing. It is easier said then done in reality but it is a good start to lay possible solutions on the ground. Unfortunately, the strength and passion that you carried out was pampered by a lack of legitimacy in examples you have drawn: Aung San Su Kyi being the president, when in fact, she merely is a Democratic leader in the country and her actions are still restricted under previously laid out political constitution by the militant government over five decades. It is easier to point fingers and blame which side is wrong and which side it right, but population increase in Muslim minorities of northern Rakhine state have been a pressing concern the local Buddhist community residing within. Perceived fear of the size of a growing population of the Muslim minority have clearly raised concerns to the Buddhist majority. If you dig a little deeper to the facts, you will also learn people of different religions and chinese and immigrants of other descends are peacefully living next to each other in the major cities like Yangon and Mandalay in Myanmar. There will be people with there is only one best religion belief in society and there are people who embrace the diversity and commonly shared history. To reconcile these people together, people will have to discard those lens of religion and start planting seeds of humanity and love despite differences in skin color and belief systems. With a pressing concern about ISIS attacks, the world seems to have stepped back in accepting and integrating Muslims into the society in fear of compromising a status quo in the future. I hope hatred is not a way to incite people to act and I hope hatred does not resort to any further destruction in our world. I am expecting UN to place a pressure over Myanmar government to carry out remedial efforts for this influx of people and also am hoping the world see this matter not just from a perspective of the suffering body of Rohingya, but also of the Myanmar people, who may just have been acting in response to their fear of losing their hard-earned, newly-transitioned society and to racial propagandas raised by head military influencers.",11,jaTDV_oOA78

The atrocities committed by the army needs to be prosecuted to its full extent but there is need for constitutional change to make this possible. Why she continues to defend the army which she doesn't have constitutional control over is what I don't understand??

Not mass peoples involved in this killing  except some Devil disciples.

im not saying myanmar soldier is right, i mean f**k those soldiers for killing women n children. 
But did you ever ask yourself why same problem diffrent country? Why when moeslm is minority in a country u will get oppressed and killed, when you re a majority, u oppressed and killed the minority religion. Or you just fight among yourself. Why other religion dont hv a big problem in other countries?? For example, moeslm is majority in middle east, and see how that end up. In indo, see how you oppress other religion and still want to make your own Moeslm country and kick all others out. In Thailand, u start a war in suratani. In philipines, u start a war in mindanao. In India the hindus hates you so much, in malaysia, anti terrorist carckdown every month, in myanmar u you want independence and the govrbmnt hate u so much, in european uk austila usa u guys start kilking innocent in the name of religion and now the western ppl start to  have islamophobia in africa you got bokoharam killing and kidnaping other religion women and children. In gaza u fight israel stab rocket and bomb somebody who is much stronger then you. And expect to win in the name of allah? 

I Dont want to start argument here. I despise violent and killing of all living things. Innocent or not killing is not right. 

Im sure you got an excuse for all the countries that hates you. But we dont need excuse and reason. Just stop the violent. Excuse and reason doesnt makes violent and killing is right. 

And think why we dont have budhistphobia or hinduphobia or christianphobia or catholicphobia or atheistphobia in this world.

Where the feck were you all? When the military (actually) oppressed and murdered tens of thousands of MUCH MORE DISTINCTIVE ETHNIC TRIBALS all across the country...

The way all of you western media portraying the beef-up elaborated stories you cant actually prove yet, that is effectively making all of the other prominent minorities/ethnics (who were under discriminations/ facing that your proposed cleansing for many decades and it is still happening today) resented your stand. Come on so-called friends, where were you? Our country is officially still brawling the civil war thats started since 1948. And nobody gave a shit about it... oh yea US supported arms and choppers to the military junta in 60s as China backed up the communists.... then they bombed these anti comm shells on the villages of Karen, Karenni, Kachin, Mon and several other smaller tribes.... the army burnt down whole regions... WHERE WERE YOUR FLiPPING LIPS that is now so sadly spouting out non-stop...? You were never really here with us all these times! now... you guys just showed up right in time.... perhaps you guys got some good sponsors from some middle east shitty rich thingy.... probably...

This is like a time capsule of how a country becomes a democracy. australia did this to the aborigines. they still steal there kids of there parents and lockas many as they can up. just because a country becomes a democracy doesnt mean its one of the good places now where they have freedom. they still remain silent on certain issues and lie all the time and aim to make all countries democratic at any cost of peoples lives. how a country becomes a democracy can be seen in the treatment of the rohingas.,4,7DCTkNGUvXA

Arakan was one of the earliest Indianized kingdoms in southeast Asia. The Rohingya are descendants of the people of ancient Wethali (Veshali) kingdom of Arakan. Burma conquered Arakan in 1784 and killed millions of Arakanese people. Seven million Arakanese people killed  during occupation of and more were killed in different times after that. In the 10th century, the Rakkhines entered Arakan and killed the entire people of Waithali kingdom. Rohingya are people of Indo-Aryan origins having mixed blood of Arabs, Persians, Moghuls, Pathans and Bengalis.  they are the first inhabitants of Arakan and the Rakhines and Burmese entered Arakan after 10tth century. Rohingyas do not want to be ruled by Burma. Rohingyas have become a minority people from a nation in the hands of Burmese. Rohingyas want justice and their once an independent Arakan back which has been occupied by the Burma's Konbaung dynasty killing millions.

The Rohingya have been living in the Rakhine state for centuries and their ethnicity + language are associated with that area, infact THEIR land has been confiscated by the corrupt burma Army. You don't know when evil dictators will exclude you from being a part of a country, it can be anyone. Just because they don't look Buddhist doesn't mean they don't belong there.

And about the Rohingya militant insurgency of resistance, when you treat people like animals sooner or later they'll start to behave like animals, some of them.

Where is UN calling for Islamic S to be put on trial for war crimes?
UN is the political Wing of the first billionaire terrorist group to commit genocide throughout the world.

a.) What has been done by the state to avoid further damage to the minority Rohingyas?

b.) What interim relief has been made available by the state to those affected?

On the issue of whether or not it is a case of genocide:

For mass killings to be referred to as a genocide (motion of the state), it is needs to be proven that the person/s who carried out the killings were simply the bearers of the intentions of the broader state. That, by questioning the response of the state to the incident in retrospective and as of date.  

If the answers to a.) & b.) is not reasonable, it ought to be genocide.

If those who carried out the execution are roaming freely, it ought be a case of genocide.

If those who carried out the execution received any reward (tangible/intangible) from the state, it ought to be a genocide.",0,2FzP7NXayr8

Aung San Suu Kyi is powerless in a country still run by military rule.

For the past few years, Aung San has been downplaying a genocide that led an entire ethnicity to flee their country and calling it an internal conflict.

Aung San has been downplaying the numbers of Rohingya who fled their country.

Aung San has been downplaying the damages her armed forces have made to Rohingya's villages from burning them down to ashes, rape, murder and torture.

Aung San has been promising investigations but how many of her armed forces and high-ranking officers have been actually tried and sentenced for their crimes or did they mostly get exonerated or pardoned?

Aung San isn't actually aware of the plight of her people.

Aung San fear the military of her country and has no power over them.

Aung San might actually be a conspirator in this in order for her to please the military generals and gain their trust to secure more her office and authority. Unfortunately this how things go in third world countries.",0,2FzP7NXayr8

minority groups in many muslim countries?
The world is currently facing an Immigration and multicultural problem. And this is the challenge china is currently facing in Xinjiang. It has initiated what it calls re-education or correction centers and describes the exercise as  as reformed integration.
India also just enacted a law, which grants automatic Indian citizenship to religious minorities fleeing persecution from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Jains, Parsis and Sikhs are included in this list. It calls the exercise war on illegal immigration in defending the new law.
Europe & many other countries too are currently undergoing a cultural problem brought about by foreign ideologies and cultures. The far right secured big wins in recent elections.
Colonization also played a role to the problems the world is facing now. People who ought to have been together were separated and those who should have living separately were also forced together. Such differences in ideology is what brought about the separation of India and Pakistan.

For the past few years, Aung San has been downplaying a genocide that led an entire ethnicity to flee her country and call it an internal conflict.

Aung San has been downplaying the numbers of Rohingya who fled her country.

Aung San has been downplaying the damages her armed forces have made to Rohingya's villages from burning them down to ashes to rape, murder and torture.

Aung San has been promising investigations but how many of her armed forces and high-ranking officers have been actually tried and sentenced for their crimes or did they mostly get exonerated or pardoned?

Aung San isn't actually aware of the plight of her people.

Aung San fear the military of her country and has no power over them.

Aung San might actually be a conspirator in this in order for her to please the military generals and gain their trust to secure more her office and authority. Unfortunately this how things go in third world countries.",1,H05aVCQ78Es

We know our government also lend a helping hand discreetly because legally they are not citizens.

Roronoa Zoro,"Get your facts checked and make sure you expose those people trying to make money off the struggling nations (instead of spreading Fake News). Why isn't anyone & the UN betting an eye on those families in separate cages at the Mexican-US border? For once, big public gatherings in Myanmar that dont involve the military whipping out their guns. 

First of all, Aung San Su Kyi isnt the president of . Myanmar citizens barely have their rights. Theres barely any justice on the ground. How can a terrorized country be accused of committing genocide? How can Aung San Su Kyi, who doesnt have much power over the military party, to fix everything the other party does for hundreds of years since her father was assassinated? Her own law advisor was assassinated a few years ago (presumably by the military). 
In this Bengali (Rohingya) case: all the oppositions accusations to this Noble Peace Prize Winner are like  youre a surgeon, why dont you operate on yourself? Because she Cant ? Shes doing all she can for the terrorists & the victims from BOTH sides (Myanmar & Bangladesh). Myanmar took on many refugees and helped them. But, if the refugees get involved with terrorists and rape Myanmar women, the military would get involved and abuse their power to ""calm the riots"". ASSK has nothing to do with the decisions. And also, Religion has nothing to do with this. They had no proof that Buddhists committed this. That was also a publicity stunt the Bangladesh terrorists made in the earlier times of this case to deter the truth from coming out. 

Where was the world court when Myanmar people were the true victims of genocides and injustice?

ahmad puad abu bakar,"Kami sebagai rakyat Malaysia mohon dan merayu kepada kerajaan Muhyiddin Yassin supaya bertindak dengan cepat dan segera isu Rohingya di negara ini. Kami rakyat Malaysia sudah letih dah tengok bangsa ini dgn berbagai2 masalah dan isu. Dah berapa kali nak bagi tahu kepada kerajaan Muhyiddin Yassin. Namum tidak ada sebarang tindakan terhadap pendatang asing dan Rohingya mereka makin BESAR KEPALA di bumi Malaysia. 

Kamu Muhyiddin dah dapat kuasa kena lakukan yang terbaik kpd rakyat Malaysia. Kamu kena ingat PRU 15 akan datang penentu kuasa kamu kekal atau tidak. Kalau kamu tidak dapat menyelesaikan isu ini secepat mungkin, jangan ingat kerusi empuk PM akan kekal. Pendatang asing dan Rohingya ini boleh mengancam keselamatan negara, kalau dibiarkan. Kalau kamu tak mampu nak ambil tindakan, kami boleh pilih orang lain sebagai PM, PRU 15 ni.

Sehingga bangsa Rohingya menuntut hak sama rata macam Bumiputra dari kerajaan Malaysia. Ini sudah kurang ajar. Itu sebabnya kenapa kerajaan Myanmar bunuh dan halau bangsa ini?  Bangsa yang tak sedar diri dan tak tahu dek untung. Mereka bangsa Bangladesh yang tinggal di Myanmar menuntut hak autonomi kat kerajaan Myanmar. Balai2 polis di Myanmar dibakar oleh mereka. Tidak mustahil kalau bangsa Rohingya ini akan menuntut hak autonomi dengan kerajaan Malaysia. Mereka kini baru sikit tunggu apabila ramai nanti. Baru sikit dah mengaku peyumbang ekonomi Malaysia nak Selayang  dan nak hak sama rata. Muhyiddin kau jangan jadi bodoh sgt dgn membiarkan bangsa ini berkembang. Sudah terbukti apa yang berlaku di Myanmar. Muhyiddin kau tak tengok ke? 

Mereka cuba buat perkara yang sama dengan kerajaan Malaysia. Walaupun pun kononya beragama Islam, tapi majoriti nya tak tahu apa2 tentang Islam pun. Sekadar untuk meraih simpati mengaku diri Islam mengucap sahadah pun tak tahu. Bukan semuanya Islam.  Muhyiddin dengar sini Kerajaan Malaysia harus bertindak lebih tegas dengan bangsa ini. Hantar bangsa ini balik secepat mungkin, sekarang ini kerajaan tentera berkuasa di Myanmar. Tak payah nak tunjuk baik pada negara asing, kononya Malaysiaini baik sgt, dan akhirnya menjahanamkan bangsa dan negara sendiri. Rakyat sendiri pun ramai yg tak makan, nak tangggung Rohingya makan?

Sahih Bukhari (52:177) - Allah's Apostle said, ""The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. ""O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him."" 

Quran (9:5) - ""So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captive and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them."" 

Hadith 9:4 ""Wherever you find infidels kill them; for whoever kills them shall have reward on the Day of Resurrection.""

Quran (2:244) - ""Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things."" 

Quran (4:74) - ""Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward."" 

Quran (4:76) - ""Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah""

Quran (4:89) - ""They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks.""

 Sveto pismo kae: proitajte Hebrejima 4: 15-16;
 Ko se zauzima za njih Jevrejima 7:25;
 Kur'an kae da je Isus Boja Rije i Boji Duh (Sura 3: 45; 4: 171;

 Sveta Biblija to potvruje u Psalmu 33: 6.  Stoga je Rije i stvaralaka i vjena.  Nadalje, u vezi Boje Rijei, Sveto pismo kae: U poetku je bila Rije, i Rije je bila s Bogom, i Rije je bila Bog.  Jovan 1: 1;  Prije nego to kaete da je Sveto pismo promenjeno nije u originalu , morate se zapitati: Moe li smrtnik promijeniti rijei Svemogueg?  Prije nego to kaete da krani tuju tri boga, morate se zapitati;  Da li hriani zaista oboavaju tri boga;  Jeste li ikada itali Sveto pismo?  Osumnjienog treba smatrati nevinim dok mu se ne dokae krivica!

Almayra K,"I am from Srebrenica. I have a message for all of those in the comments that allow their emotion (which are justified) to overpower their reason.

I never met my grandfathers and two uncles, they were slaughtered. My mother tells me my grandfather used to carry us around as babies, but those few stories is all we have. Other uncles managed to survive the path trough the forest. My twin brother is deaf because of the war. I heard terrors from my other family that none of you can imagine. But we can still speak for ourselves.

We should be careful that our hurt does not go overboard. The person who really KNOWS a consequence of violence will always call for everything to avoid it again if they can.

The Serbs in Serbia were under so much intense propaganda. My family talks to me that some of their neighbours were telling them ""We cannot tell why, but you need to leave"" before the war. My mother took my brother to hospital during the war and she was driven by a Serb a part of the way. When she came there a nurse told to her ""you are slaughtering our children there"". My mother was ""What? All of the Serb women and children left because they knew what was coming"". 

I think the only way forward for us is communication. How can two people leave side by side for hundreds of years and do not know they worship the same God? How? They don't even know. Approach of let's live together and leave religion out of it obviously cannot work. The ignorance festers into hate. We need dialogue.",4,gMuk3t3NoTU

"xAle Jones lnformation war, war info for your mind","*Important, there is a genocide happening like during WW2.  Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and now they are doing it under the guise of a corona virus pandemic.*  Corona means crown, and a virus attacking the crown/government is some thing exposing government lies.(2Corinthians4:4).  Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 can only apply to one place on earth.  Research it well to learn who has been behind slaughters for centuries.  1John5:19 is trying to stop Daniel12:4,2:44,45.  Hitler was a Catholic and never excommunicated.  Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 is orchestrating this assault against humanity, but they are trying to blame it on innocent peoples, Countries and groups.  They are responsible for boycotts, civil disobedience, sabotage, and soon to be mass killings like against the Jews in Nazi Germany.  People were rounded up to go to concentration camps because of a supposed typhus epidemic, and were gassed on the way by vehicle exhaust, or later by zyklon B rodent extermination gas with the smell taken out (#%$&%$#$)cyanide.  Revelation mentions that people should leave the Revelation18:4 group if they don't want to receive her *plagues.  (Hello, if you don't want to receive her plagues!)*  According to Revelation 18 this group wears scarlet(Cardinals), and Purple(Bishops).  It refers to a city Kingdom (Rome is the only city kingdom in the world), that rules over the Kings of the earth.  Where are the Kings?  The Roman Empire broke in 2 and from those 2 divisions came 10 Countries.  5 Countries on each leg of the Roman Empire.  The (cross or X) is on the shields of the the Empire, and it symbolizes the ten Kingdoms, and the religious beliefs.  And through time nations and peoples have not been able to sell their goods to other nations with out this mark.  According to official writings no one may buy or sell or say a greeting to any one who has left the cross.  The X or cross originates from the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet the taw, which means a mark, both literal and figurative.  In The Bible book of Ezekiel, God put a taw(mark) on the people who were crying over the loss of wickedness.  The mark was not for salvation.  Revelation/Apocalypse 13:18 says you won't be able to buy or sell with out the taw(mark) of the beast(Empire).  The cross has been used through out history, including the Egyptians called it the anke, which was a symbol of power.  The cross has become associated with the Messiah(Christ), and that is where Xmass, and Christmas comes from.  Popes have always had a mitre(triple tiered crown) with 666 on it in Latin (Vicarivs Filli Dei).  Latin letters have a number associated with it, just like Hebrew and Greek.  Rome has called for mass destruction and sabotage to stop people from hearing this.  Government and Churches working together in self interest, not in the interest of the people.  The earth belong to the people collectively.  1John5:19 is getting people to attack the people trying to make you free.  *Clear your browser history and cache, and YouTube search and viewing history!  Please pray for me and you!*  God for warned about these things happening. 
The hate for Acts2:44 runs deep, and that is why Christian nations that are committing genocide under the guise of a corona virus, just as Hitler did under the guise of a typhus epidemic, are falsely attacking China saying that they are the ones committing genocide.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb-MNi8E-TA   The last war China fought was WW2, and that was because they were attacked.  Try reading your Bible and having a scrap of decency!   Muslim Countries have not condemned this because it is a fake, and a over for a WW2 like genocide happening.  Hitler exterminated under the guise of a typhus epidemic and now they are doing it under the guise of a corona virus pandemic. ;!((",0,hh8QOh1aXRM

The limitations on our freedom, the crimes against our dignity as human beings, will seem to them remote and unreal.Its cheering to think that when they meet an European it will never occur to them to touch the imaginary forelock, or bow in servility, as some of our older Men still do, so hard is it to break long-established habits.

Native American history after Columbus is absolutely tragic, and too many people dont see the extent of it. For example, the Tano peoples developed mass suicidal tendencies (e.g. mothers performing infanticide, men jumping off of cliffs, etc.) after endless mistreatment from the Spanish. Today, natives are still suffering from high rates of drug abuse, alcoholism, obesity, domestic violence, and sexual abuse. If you blame the natives themselves for these issues, you are highly ignorant. Who subjected them to slavery and destitution? Who forced them out of their homelands? Theres so much to native history that people arent aware of: the suffering, but also the sophistication of the cultures.

Bernardo chill,"The Canadian government said on Thursday it would direct more resources to First Nations police and address systemic racism in the justice system and law enforcement to tackle violence against Indigenous women, but gave no time frame for achieving its transformative changes.

The government promised to give Indigenous communities more control over some social services and improve access to healthcare. Its plan comes two years after a report into the deaths of more than 1,000 Indigenous women and girls in recent decades called it a national genocide.

The government said it would address systemic racism among the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the national law enforcement agency responsible for policing many rural areas in the country, through improved recruitment and training.

Also, this hypocritical PM has an entirely corrupt cabinet. He's essentially a pupper who speaks on behalf of his masters. He'll speak about Kashmiri Muslims because of self-interest but won't condemn the situation in China, Syria, Iraq because that doesn't align with his interests.

Hamza Sulaiman,"What a joke. I always wondered what Imran Khan response would be if someone was to ask him about the torture of Muslims in China. This just shows that as long as he's getting money, he'll let China do whatever they wants and to whoever they wants. I have no Respect for this Imran Khan anymore.
 
Before he talks about how western society sees Muslims after 9/11 and after the reporter asked him about the Muslims in China, his response completely changes and he started focuses on what's happening to Muslims in his border and he says he's focusing on what's happening in his country. He's just a puppet of China and can't say a word against them because they'll stop funding. Such a disgrace.

Hanwen Tan,"The following is what I borrowed from a Malaysian YouTubers comment:



Im from Malaysia. China has traded with Malaysia for 2000 years. In those years, they had been the worlds biggest powers many times. Never once they sent troops to take our land. Admiral Zhenghe came to Malacca five times, in gigantic fleets, and a flagship eight times the size of Christopher Columbus flagship, Santa Maria. He could have seized Malacca easily, but he did not. In 1511, the Portuguese came. In 1642, the Dutch came. In the 18th century the British came. We were colonised by each, one after another.



When China wanted spices from India, they traded with the Indians. When they wanted gems, they traded with the Persian. They didnt take lands. The only time China expanded beyond their current borders was in Yuan Dynasty, when Genghis and his descendants Ogedei Khan, Guyuk Khan & Kublai Khan concurred China, Mid Asia and Eastern Europe. But Yuan Dynasty, although being based in China, was a part of the Mongolian Empire. 



Then came the Century of Humiliation. Britain smuggled opium into China to dope the population, a strategy to turn the trade deficit around, after the British could not find enough silver to pay the Qing Dynasty in their tea and porcelain trades. After the opium warehouses were burned down and ports were closed by the Chinese in ordered to curb opium, the British started the Opium War I, which China lost. Hong Kong was forced to be surrendered to the British in a peace talk (Nanjing Treaty). The British owned 90% of the opium market in China, during that time, Queen Victoria was the worlds biggest drug baron. The remaining 10% was owned by American merchants from Boston. Many of Bostons institutions were built with profit from opium. 



After 12 years of Nanjing Treaty, the West started getting really really greedy. The British wanted the Qing government: 

1. To open the borders of China to allow goods coming in and out freely, and tax free. 

2. Make opium legal in China.

Insane requests, Qing government said no. The British and French (with supports from the US), started Opium War II with China, which again, China lost. The Anglo-French military raided the Summer Palace, and threatened to burn down the Imperial Palace, the Qing government was forced to pay with ports, free business zones, 300,000 kilograms of silver and Kowloon was taken. Since then, Chinas resources flew out freely through these business zones and ports. In the subsequent amendment to the treaties, Chinese people were sold overseas to serve as labor. 



In 1900, China suffered attacks by the 8-National Alliance (Empire of Japan, Russian Empire, British Empire (including India), France, USA, Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary). Innocent Chinese civilians in Peking (Beijing now) were murdered, buildings were destroyed & women were raped. The Imperial Palace was raided, and treasures ended up in museums like the British Museum in London and the Louvre in Paris. 



In late 1930s China was occupied by the Japanese in WWII. Millions of Chinese died during the occupancy. 300,000 Chinese died in Nanjing Massacre alone. 



Mao brought China together again from the shambles. There were peace and unity for some time. But Maos later reign saw sufferings and deaths from famine and power struggles. 



Then came Deng Xiao Ping and his infamous black-cat and white-cat story. His preference in pragmatism than ideologies has transformed China. This thinking allowed China to evolve all the time to adapt to the actual needs in the country, instead of rigidly bounded to ideologies. It also signified the death of Communism in actually practice in China. The current Socialism+Meritocracy+Market Economy model fits the Chinese like gloves, and it propels the uprise of China. Singapore has a similar model, and has been arguably more successful than Hong Kong, because Hong Kong being gateway to China, was riding on the economic boom in China, while Singapore had no one to gain from.



In just 30 years, the CPC have moved 800 millions of people out from poverty. The rate of growth is unprecedented in human history. They have built the biggest mobile network, by far the biggest high speed rail network in the world, and they have become a behemoth in infrastructure. They made a fishing village called Shenzhen into the worlds second largest technological centre after the Silicon Valley. They are growing into a technological power house. It has the most elaborate e-commerce and cashless payment system in the world. They have launched exploration to Mars. The Chinese are living a good life and China has become one of the safest countries in the world. The level of patriotism in the country has reached an unprecedented height. 



For all of the achievements, the West has nothing good to say about it. China suffers from intense anti-China propagandas from the West. Western Media used the keyword Communist to instil fear and hatred towards China. 

Everything China does is negatively reported. 



They claimed China used slave labor in making iPhones. The truth was, Apple was the most profitable company in the world, it took most of the profit, leave some to Foxconn (a Taiwanese company) and little to the labor. 



They claimed China was inhuman with one-child policy. At the same time, they accused China of polluting the earth with its huge population. The fact is the Chinese consume just 30% of energy per capita compared to the US. 



They claimed China underwent ethnic cleansing in Xinjiang. The fact is China has a policy which priorities ethnic minorities. For a long time, the ethnic minorities were allowed to have two children and the majority Han only allowed one. The minorities are allowed a lower score for university intakes. There are 39,000 mosque in China, and 2100 in the US. China has about 3 times more mosque per muslim than the US. 

When terrorist attacks happened in Xinjiang, China had two choices:

1. Re-educate the Uighur extremists before they turned terrorists.

2. Let them be, after they launch attacks and killed innocent people, bomb their homes. 

China chose 1 to solve problem from the root and not to do killing. How the US solve terrorism? Fire missiles from battleships, drop bombs from the sky. 



During the pandemic, 

When China took extreme measures to lockdown the people, they were accused of being inhuman.

When China recovered swiftly because of the extreme measures, they were accused of lying about the actual numbers.

When Chinas cases became so low that they could provide medical support to other countries, they were accused of politically motivated. 

Western Media always have reasons to bash China. 



Just like any country, there are irresponsible individuals from China which do bad and dirty things, but the China government overall has done very well. But I hear this comment over and over by people from the West: I like Chinese people, but the CPC is evil. What they really want is the Chinese to change the government, because the current one is too good. 



Fortunately China is not a multi-party democratic country, otherwise the opposition party in China will be supported by notorious NGOs (Non-Government Organization) of the USA, like the NED (National Endowment for Democracy), to topple the ruling party. The US and the British couldnt crack Mainland China, so they work on Hong Kong. Of all the ex-British colonial countries, only the Hong Kongers were offered BNOs by the British. Because the UK would like the Hong Kongers to think they are British citizens, not Chinese. A divide-and-conquer strategy, which they often used in Color Revolutions around the world. 



They resort to low dirty tricks like detaining Huaweis CFO & banning Huawei. They raised a silly trade war which benefits no one. Trade deficit always exist between a developing and a developed country. USA is like a luxury car seller who ask a farmer: why am I always buying your vegetables and you havent bought any of my cars? 



When the Chinese were making socks for the world 30 years ago, the world let it be. But when Chinese started to make high technology products, like Huawei and DJI, it caused red-alert. Because when Western and Japanese products are equal to Chinese in technologies, they could never match the Chinese in prices. First world countries want China to continue in making socks. Instead of stepping up themselves, they want to pull China down. 



The recent movement by the US against China has a very important background. When Libya, Iran, and China decided to ditch the US dollar in oil trades, Gaddafis was killed by the US, Iran was being sanctioned by the US, and now its Chinas turn. The US has been printing money out of nothing. The only reason why the US Dollar is still widely accepted, is because its the only currency which oil is allowed to be traded with. The US has an agreement with Saudi that oil must be traded in US dollar ONLY. Without the petrol-dollar status, the US dollars will sink, and America will fall. Therefore anyone trying to disobey this order will be eliminated. China will soon use a gold-backed crypto-currency, the alarms in the White House go off like mad.



Chinas achievement has been by hard work. Not by looting the world.

Yang Zhenjen,"By Ehab Bayoumi on US/Canada/Dutch declaration of genocide in Xinjiang.

Ehab completely exposed the nature of the US/Anglos beast:

I'm an ex-Muslim from Egypt but let's pretend for the purposes of this question that I'm still Muslim. Also thislll be long, sorry, but bear with me.

Right now about 4 or 5 million people in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and East Jerusalem are living under a 50-year-old Israeli occupation with blatantly inferior rights and in circumstances unsuitable for human life, which are quite explicitly designed to drive them out and replace them with foreign settlers.
Response from the Western world: Coddling up to Netanyahu's far-right government and ignoring and even cracking down on all domestic protest (BDS, anti-Israel activities at Western universities, etc.).

In 2003 Iraq, which was a functional state even after 10 years of US sanctions, was brutally invaded and its army, police, government, and ruling party dismantled in a matter of months, based on accusations of nuclear weapons and terrorist links which proved to be false. Iraq then experienced the bloodiest civil war of its history, not to mention the rise of ISIS. The death toll runs at least into the hundreds of thousands.
Response from the Western world: All is forgotten.

Right now Iran is suffering from the most brutal sanctions suffered by any nation in history (even worse than the ones applied to apartheid South Africa). Several Western countries have cut off diplomatic relations. Iran can't sell its oil, its currency is now worthless, it's cut off from the global financial system, it couldn't even access a World Bank loan to help it deal with coronavirus, and even international children's charities in it aren't allowed to hand out cash donations anymore, only food packages. You can't even send a letter to Iran right now. This is based on accusations of an illegal nuclear weapons program, accusations which are not supported by any evidence (remember Iraq?).
Response from the Western world: Totally ignored.

NATO bombed and destroyed the Libyan state of Muammar Al-Gaddafi based on accusations that he, among other things, was using a mercenary African army and even jet bombers against peaceful protesters. These accusations turned out to be false and now Libya has been at civil war for 10 years.
Response from the Western world: All is forgotten.

The Communist government of Afghanistan enlisted Soviet help against armed Islamic extremists. The US happily swooped in and turned those Taleban extremists into a proper army with funding, weapons, and political backing. 15,000 Soviets died, the Soviets pulled out, the Afghan government collapsed, a civil war happened, the Taleban seized power and ruled for a decade and turned the country back to the Stone Age.
Response from the Western world: All is forgotten.

Nobody in the Western world ever bore responsibility for these atrocities. No one was tried for war crimes, no politician even lost his office, not a penny was sent to these countries as compensation. Hell, until now there hasn't even been an official acknowledgement of wrongdoing. In fact the West has the nerve to complain about these countries producing refugees after it destroyed them.

Now the main point

There's supposedly an anti-Muslim genocide going on in China's Xinjiang. Despite the allegation of millions of Muslims being imprisoned, beaten, raped and tortured, there is no objective evidence of even one concentration camp or one death.
But here the Western world (US, Canada, Australia, Britain, EU) is suddenly extremely involved. It's denouncing and even insulting China every day. Every politician and every news organization is doing it. It's recognized the matter as genocide, it's giving money and political backing to Muslim separatist groups, it's shutting down Chinese institutions and sanctioning Chinese corporations, and it's trying to isolate China economically and diplomatically.

Muslim nations talked to China and sent observers to Xinjiang. They decided nothing was going on. But the Western world is being extra vigilant. Its conscience just can't rest. Suddenly it loves Muslims so much that even when they say they're not being oppressed, it still says they're being oppressed.

Huh? Why's the response so different this time? Why does the West suddenly care so much about Muslim suffering? The West really loves oppressed Uyghurs, but shows no such concern for Libyans, Syrians, Palestinians, Afghans, Iraqis or Iranians.

You might have a very poor image of Muslims, you might think they're all idiots. But I assure you they're not too stupid to see that the West is trying to enlist Muslim allies in a smear campaign and economic war against its #1 rival and only non-Western rising superpower, based on bogus horror-claims and a pretence of humanitarianism.

And what better way to weaken both China and Muslims?

The West is turning for help to the very same Muslim countries it wrecked, and whose problems it otherwise totally ignores. But the Muslim world will never turn its back on a great power that has always shown it respect and friendship, to prostitute itself to a Western world which offers only arrogance, violence, neocolonialism, chaos and death.

It's just not gonna happen, the Muslims aren't buying it. Trust me I know we're not the most educated, enlightened, logical population (you might even call us barbarians), but we are just not that dumb. We know true friends from lying backstabbers.",0,lZejLYkCZ3c

These kinds of Genocides even supported by the West with double devil  std while themselves keep fabricating fake genocide news to discredit other countries. 



The West  should humbly learn from China by adopting favourable ethnic policies towards people of  minorities( including Urighurs,Tibetans,

Mongolians & etc in China ) by making them easier to make good living in China. Also the West should learn from China by allowing minorities to establish autonomous provinces and regions( including Xinjiang, Tibet, inner Mongolia, HongKong, Macau & etc) to run their own Government ! 

I wonder there are any autonomous states or provinces in USA and the five eyes' nations being run  by native people within their own inherited ancestral states and provinces??  So don't be hypocritical just criticize other countries but themselves done nothing good to minorities!!! In fact most people of minorities in China have better living conditions than those natives in USA or the 5 eyes immigrants nations. However, the West never has such favourable ethnic  policies towards minorities living within USA or the five eyes nations instead just keep discrediting/ demonizing China or other countries but themselves done  nothing good to minorities people  so as to make them feel great or supreme than others!  Those keep fabricating fake news to discredit other countries are Really devils and will surely  be punished by God to hell soonest!

More than 28 per cent US police killings were black, natives or color  Americans despite blacks, natives and color  accounts for 13 per cent of US population.  Just in 2020, US had 592 mass shootings and 41509 people got killed which means  in average 119 people got killed a day ! Blacks, natives and color people were 3 times likely to be killed by US police.  One in four young  Native or Asian Americans had been target of racial bullying. People of blacks,  native and color account for two thirds of all US imprisoned minors.  During most current pandemic period, more than half million Americans died of Coronavirus due to US govt mishandling of Covid19,  blacks, natives and color   made up 25 per cent of all Covid19 deaths when blacks, natives and color  just accounts for 13 per cent of US population.

Some Hindus also say that Hindus dont use verses from their scripture to justify killing of non-Hindus

Lets take a look  

Brahma Purana 106.121 There is a hell named Gudapaka. It is full of boiling eddies of treacle and molasses. A man responsible for mixture in castes is thrown into it. He is burnt therein.

Yajur Veda 13.12
O king, make progress in thy duty of administration, extend happiness to the virtuous. O terrible chastiser, burn down the irreligious foes. O splendid person, humiliate and consume utterly like dried up stubble, him, who encourages our foe.

But how many muslims have openly condemned the killing of security forces either in J and K or stone pelting on the medics in many places or the hate spread by some Mullahs against Hindus ? How many of you have openly come out, protested on the streets or wrote editorials or commented on news channels? Hate was sown by whom? I still see many Muslim leaders coming on news channels and defending the actions of their people. Is it acceptable.  Peace can prevail only if all agree to abide by the rules laid by government.  Hope true peace and love for all prevails in this country.",0,TOrxsOZqtA0

Indian Hindus Are Shifting Out Of India Which Leads To The Decrease in Population Of Hindus In India, And  In Major States Hindu's Are Converting Thier Religion, As Per Data Per 3 Hindu Convertors 2 Are Converted Into Muslim And 1 To Other Religion
But In North Hindus Are Dominating The Land By More Population Then Other Religion Still The Population Of Hindu Has Been Decreased If We See According To The Population Of India 
Hindu Population Data:
1947 : 89% 
1964 : 84%
2010:  81% 
2019 : 72% ( The Population Of Hindus Has Been Drastically Fell Down Between 2010/2019

 

And Muslims From Arab's And Middle East Is Shifting To India Manly To Kerala Which Whill Lead The Population Of Muslims In India 
And Now As From Indian Law Per Couple Should Have 2/3 Childrens But For This, Muslims Male's Are Marrying 2/3 Wifes But Now Its Decreasing In India, Now Muslim Male's  Can Only Marry A Single Woman, But Still There Population Is Growing Faster Than Hindus And Christians, And Now The Muslims Have 39% Populations Of India, According To The Indian Population Data, Till 2050 The Population Of Muslims Will Be Around 44% And Other 56% Will Be Other Religion Including Hindu And Christian


About Christians, There Majority Poplulation Is Increasing But Not At That Much Speed Of Hindus Or Muslims 
But According To Data 20% Christians Are Converted Of Other Religion Mainly From North States,
And The Same Goes For Christians, Many Youth Christians Are Shifting To Western Countries

V Lau,"Human rights issue in Xinjiang - horrific crimes against Uyghurs and even genocides, what? Here are the hard facts that I believe, and not biased rhetorics and propaganda. Don't fall for it again like the rhetoric about having weapons for mass destruction in Iraq. The ensuing invasion of Iraq was the real cause of the humanitarian issues and horrific crimes against Iraqis. In the most recent UN General Assembly sessions on human rights discussion, 62 countries signed a joint statement supporting China. Together with other countries deliberating at the UN sessions, there were over 100 countries on Chinas side. This is compared to just 43 countries including the US and its western allies, who are alleging human rights abuse on the Uyghurs (Muslim ethnic minority) in Xinjiang. There is one critical fact that is often overlooked - none of these 43 countries is a Muslim country. On the contrary, there are many Muslim countries supporting China. Between 2010 to 2018, the Uyghur population grew from 10.2 m to 12.7 m (much faster than Hans 8.8m to 9.0m). Between 2010 to 2019, Xinjiangs GDP grew close to 3 times from RMB 542 billion to RMB 1.36 trillion. Such facts do not support the notion of genocide, as Xinjiang would have been beset with social unrest, refugee issues, poor economies, and a declining population. Time is the best judge. Given its pivotal position in the Belt and Road Initiative, I envisage Xinjiang will prosper even further with improving regional integration, trading activities, and infrastructure. Perhaps in 10-20 years, do you think I am right about Xinjiang, or the viewpoints of these western media and propagandists?",0,z9aLNxcokOE

Eric Ngo,"what is cultural genocide anyway? Isn't the human race evolved over time with interactions? Based on the video claims, we can argue that Europeans had culturally genocide the world. Notice, our clothing, hair cute, etc. are all western.

Hate people using cultural genocide as an argument. They are over 200 formal languages in the world and they are many more languages had been lost over a few thousand years. If you look back long in enough every village has its own culture and mean of communication. 

I can't wait until the world speaks and writes only one language. Language is the man for communication and life will be much simpler when everyone speaks and writes the same language.

In software, we have something called UML (Unified Modeling Language) that good software engineers around the world can understand without any misunderstanding or guessing game.

To be honest, at first, I was sympathetic to the Uyghur moment and decide to research more. The more I do my research I more felt like I had been fooled. For example, the World Uyghur Congress accuses China of Uyghur sterilization but if you check on World Uyghur Congress leader Rebiya Kadeer's family you be surprised how many kids she and your children have. Also, the Uyghur population in Xinjiang multiply doing the time when China had 1 child policy.

- Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in     whole or in part
- Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group
- Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group""

She is unfortunately very broadly casting that word about to the extent that the word loses much relevance because it could describe almost anything she wants it to mean. 
There has to be ""intentional action to DESTROY in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.""   
How many of the examples she glibly cited fit that ""intent to destroy"" criterion?
Yes, the early Islamic invasions occasioned massive slaughter that no doubt  qualified as attempted genocide.
But let us not conflate everything under one term. It won't work.
By her definition, trying to introduce Western ideas of empowering women is ""genocide."" Introducing and teaching English language is ""cultural genocide."" Trying to stop Dalits from being mistreated by there fellow Hindus is also ""cultural genocide."" 
 So practically any form of modernization can be interpreted by her definition to be ""cultural genocide.""  

The Jews were subjected to an intentional attempt at extermination during the holocaust. 
That is genocide without doubt. 
Kapoor is misusing the word so much as to render it almost meaningless as a means to accurately describe and compare different situations.

And they state that the Earth has been home to 5 very advanced human civilisations over millions of years and each one was destroyed through natural catastrophe. To support this there are five super impact meteor craters on the planet, and in the UK we have five layers of anthracite coal, with a dead zone above and no fossil records,   yet, Slowly over time the fossil record returns as life recovers.   When the geologist saw this it terrified them.  But it proves that there is much truth contained in Hinduism which could benefit the whole world as it seems to be the oldest and most knowledgeable of faiths in many areas.",0,p1c9dYfU1fU
Kevin Guizan,"Biblical Christianity was distorted by Roman Catholics and in the name of Christianity Catholics have perpetrated great crimes in history. Dr. Melissa is referring to professing (not practicing) Christian European colonisers and warring Islamists.
Study well the works of Apostle Thomas beginning with his arrival in Cranganore (Kerala) in 52 AD ... He was martyred by Hindus in Mylapore near Chennai.
Abrahamic faith? Jews were living peacefully in India before Catholics and Islam brought great destruction to India. The British? They were expressly forbidden to convert Hindus, which is why a peaceful William Carey (non catholic British) had to find refuge in Serampore (under Protestant Danish) in his early works in Kolkata. He along with Ram Mohan Roy were instrumental in scorching British conscience to ban Hindu ritual wife burning called SATI.

Farry Bunny,"*PRESENT MOPLAH UPRISING MOST SERIOUS OF ALL*

*Was Organized Months In Advance*

*BY THOMAS STEWART RYAN.*
*(Chicago Tribute Foreign News Service)* MADRAS, DEC. 12 - Of all their thirty-five outbreaks against the British, the Moplahs present revolt is the most serious, both in extent and by virtue of its coincidence with the Gandhi crisis.

The British declare that the rising was organized for months in advance. Others were riots. This is rebellion. Gandhis promise of Swaraj in August ran like wildfire through the combustible Moplah country. Grievances of the Moslems against the Hindu landlords were dug up, though many Hindus shared the unrest and Gandhi Ki Jai was the watchword.

Volunteers appeared in uniform. Agitators reverted from non-violence to picturing houris in paradise for warriors fallen in battle. The Moplahs are Sunni Moslems who revere the sultan-caliph and loathe his enemies.

*Statement of Moplahs says Report Is British Propaganda.*

Nee York. Dec. 6.Charges that the Moplahs of Malabar have put to death, many Hindus and forcibly converted others to Mohammedanism were denied and characterized as part of a British plot to discredit the Moplah movement for Indias independence. In a cablegram from Variamkunnath Kunhamed Haji. The Moplah leader. Received today by the friends of the freedom for India.

A few cases of conversion of our Hindu brethren have been reported to me, the message said. But after proper investigation we discovered the real plot. The vandals that were guilty of this crime were members of the British reserve police and British intelligence department and they joined our forces a as patriots to do such filthy work only to discredit our soldiers. There were Christians.  Hindus and Moplahs among these British agents and spies. They have deservedly been put to death.

ken p,"Equal Education policy needed for India:
If English medium education is better in India then why not translate all English curriculum and Sanskrit literature in regional languages and provide equal education/information to all? Don't people read PM's Mann k Bt in all regional languages on websites? Don't they teach the Bible in all Indian languages? Sanskrit scholars provide Vedic knowledge to westerners in English via translation and transliteration but not the same way to fellow Indians who protect languages and culture in Indic scripts.Gujarat has given great political leaders as well as simple script to the nation and yet Hindi is taught in a complex printing ink wasting script despite its simplification into Gujangari script.
If pundits were happy with the complex printing ink wasting Devanagari script they may not have created various scripts under different rulers for vernacular languages to divide the country. Nowadays Devanagari Lipi Parishad prefers a single Devanagari script despite it's simplification into Gujangar script for all Indian languages to slowly eliminate vernacular scripts the way they did with Maharashtra's MODI script.
Westerners learn Sanskrit in English via translation and transliteration and challenge Indians but Indians are not allowed to learn Sanskrit the same way in vernacular languages.Why not make the same efforts in teaching mother language as you do for Sanskrit? How modern Sanskrit is going to be better than Vedic Sanskrit in providing knowledge? Does the government spend an equal amount of money on the promotion of all state languages.

Also India has more English speakers than Great Britain and yet Indian English doesn't have it own Indian English dictionary with pronunciation key to challenge IPA with highly phonetic Indic alphabets.http://sanskrit-ai.com/threads/mappings-for-devan%C4%81gar%C4%AB-indic-roman%C4%81gar%C4%AB.333/

Krishnakumar P,First and foremost most historians betrayed this nation for decades with their tales suited for their masters. Our whole history is fully distorted glorifying mughals with no mention of great warriors who truly fought for our great motherland. Our children read this shit and believe to trust others. We must never forget such heinous acts of crimes and reminder no to let this repeat. Secondly hindus are the most ignorant and are not united unless a fire rages in their backyard even after knowing history. One day they will get wiped out in the most humiliating and gruesome way if they do not act now. Rich cultural upkeep and heritage are more important than secularism. Others should blend with these and not the other way round. Many nations very proudly pronounce their cultural heritage and religion and stand by to protect it.

We Muslims arent afraid of you, we Muslims arent giving up hope, because we know full well that God Almighty is with us. Even the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was persecuted and exiled from his own hometown of Mecca and yet he was patient, he endured hardships, beatings and was nearly killed by stones being thrown at him and yet he endured and was patient through it all. May Allah Almighty grant us the patience that our Prophet had, may Allah bless and protect all of our Muslims brothers and sisters, may Allah grant you all Jannah and forgive you from your sins and inequities. Keep in your hearts my brothers and sisters that this world is transient, this world is nothing but a test for us and remember that God is indeed aware of what the disbelievers and the wrongdoers do against you, He will avenge you, He will reward them with what they deserve. Even if the whole universe turned against us Muslims we stand FIRM together!!   *I BEAR WITNESS THERE IS NO GOD BESIDES ALLAH AND THAT MUHAMMAD IS HIS LAST AND FINAL MESSENGER* .

*(42). And never think that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do. He only delays them [i.e., their account] for a Day when eyes will stare [in horror].*

the funniest part ever seen in my working life, interviews attended by husbands, their conditions are the most shameful ever heard in my entire life, in a line if i can descrbie their demand is 
I am the Husband, I can'T offer her comfort, peace, attentions, life promised before marriage, or sit like a queen at my home, so you must hire her and keep her in your office, she cant speak well, even gujarati, english to dur ki baat hain, she has no knowledge of communications, emails, writing, dressing sense, behaving like a professional women, but hire her, pay her and teach her, on top of it salaries that i tell you not what you offer,

females lol
Now I am just having this thought in my mind as they all come from a small area as this was part of job requirement where hardly 20000 to 30000 thousand people lives, we see 100's of ad for job, if i got about 200 CV interviews conducted I am sure Indians are expecting a lot more then what they deserve, Narendra modi is totally wrong when he is expecting these Indians to work or when he says india is future having youngest population, what indians are is only shame on their own land, full of corruption, full of dirt around them, (but every house of their own is the most cleaned) only full of big words of being proud to be indian, read news papers see tv and make only statements but in real wont change them first and expect others then, worst educated presentation, worst family and life style full of control, only money greed no honesty or moral responsibilites, i am getting short of words but at the end Yes I AM TOO AN INDIAN CONSIDERED A BIG FOOL MYSELF BEING BORN AS INDIANS OR AMONGS THESE INDIANS
AND YES ABUSERS AND OPPSORS IF YOU HAVE ANY THING TO SAY AGAINSTS WHAT THESE REAL FACTS ARE THEN PLEASE FIND ME A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN TELL ME TO EXPERIENCE THESE FACTS ARE WRONG IF NOT DONT PUT RESPONSES JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE A BIG COMMUNITY LIKE PATEL, RAJPUT, DALIT, SUTHAR AND ETC ITS ABOUT INDIANS IN COMMON BECAUSE IF YOU WERE NOT HUMAN THEN YOU WONT HAVEN BEEN INDIAN,.

Businesses in China are closing down and unemployment is increasing. Chinese labours are entering illegally in Taiwan and other neighbouring countries and  are being caught. So these illegal labours are either put in the jails or pushed back to China. Other major countries like USA and Europe and the UK are following Modi's example.

Swapan Chakravarthy,"Civil rights are for all mankind but rarely goes beyond lines in a textbook. The issues in Northern part of Burma is as old as 1948 when they gained independence. First it was the Indian population which under PM Shastri found a solution however distasteful. Second, nationalisation took place post 1962, and of course with Buddhist majority, anything beyond following that faith was unacceptable. Social misdemeanours and difficulties in access meant lax impositions until about 20-years ago. Now let me add that Bangladesh is finding it very difficult with the Rohingyas who have been sheltered by them to warn that religion is no bond. Indeed civic rights and dispute resolution is the key. Taking up even medieval arms is sufficient provocation. The fate that LTTE has undergone in another Buddhist majority state should be a fair indicator of political domination is the overwhelming factor that defines the conflict.",0,sJSO8-LO0SI

INDIA TODAY where you were when nearly one and half million of Rohingya people were under siege by thousands of brutal Burmese military and by so called Rakhine people since 25 Aug 2017? Why you didn't cover that under siege news?

For your kind information, this video is moving over Internet more than one month and INDIA TODAY waked up today. This was a reaction of siege to Rohingya people by the #Burmese military and Burmese government made this siege as they do not respect the #KofiAnnan suggestion regarding citizenship law.

What is INDIATODAY's personal interest to call terrorist only Rohingya people while there other ethnic groups are fighting against Burmese cruelty since decades such as Kachin, Shan, Karen etc. Why you are not calling them terrorist?

Zubair Mohammad,"Let's see what history says about the rohingya and who the real oppressors are:
8th Century: The Rohingya, a people of South Asian origin, dwelled in an independent kingdom in Arakan, now known as Rakhine state in modern-day Myanmar.
9th to 14th Century: The Rohingya came into contact with Islam through Arab traders. Close ties were forged between Arakan and Bengal.
1784: The Burman King Bodawpaya conquered Arakan and hundreds of thousands of refugees fled to Bengal. He feared the spread of Islam in the region. From then on he began to persecute the Muslims.
1790: Hiram Cox, a British diplomat sent to assist refugees, established the town of Coxs Bazar in Bangladesh, where many Rohingya still live today.
1824 to 1942: Britain captured Burmanow known as Myanmarand made it a province of British India. Workers were migrated to Burma from other parts of British India for infrastructure projects.
1942: Japan invaded Burma, pushing out the British. As the British retreated, Burmese nationalists attacked Muslim communities who they thought had benefited from British colonial rule.
1945: Britain liberated Burma from Japanese occupation with help of Burmese nationalists led by Aung San and Rohingya fighters. Rohingyas felt betrayed as the British didnt fulfill a promise of autonomy for Arakan.
1948: Tensions increased between the government of newly independent Burma and the Rohingya, many of whom wanted Arakan to join Muslim-majority Pakistan. The government retaliated by ostracizing the Rohingya, including removing Rohingya civil servants.
1950: Some Rohingya resisted the government, led by armed groups called Mujahids. The insurgency gradually died down.
1962: General Ne Win and his Burma Socialist Programme Party seized power and took a hard line against the Rohingya.
1977: The junta began Operation Nagamin, or Dragon King, which they said was aimed at screening the population for foreigners. More than 200,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh, amid allegations of army abuses. The army denied any wrongdoing.
1978: Bangladesh struck a U.N.-brokered deal with Burma for the repatriation of refugees, under which most Rohingya returned.
1982: A new immigration law redefined people who migrated during British rule as illegal immigrants. The government applied this to all Rohingya, and stripped off them citizenship. They were denied ability to travel freely and access to resources were limited.
1989: The army changed the name of Burma to Myanmar.
1991: More than 250,000 Rohingya refugees fled what they said was forced labor, r@pe and religious persecution at the hands of the Myanmar army. The army said it was trying to bring order to Rakhine.
1992 to 1997: Around 230,000 Rohingya returned to Arakan, now known as Rakhine, under another repatriation agreement.
2012: Rioting between Rohingya and Rakhine Buddhists killed more than 100 people, mostly Rohingya. Tens of thousands of people were driven into Bangladesh. Nearly 150,000 were forced into camps in Rakhine.
2016: Rohingya resistance group Harakah al-Yaqin, after being pushed to breaking point by oppression, attacked border guard posts, killing nine soldiers. The army retaliated. More than 25,000 people fled Rakhine to Bangladesh, bringing accounts of killing, r@pe and arson. Aung San Suu Kyis government denied the atrocities. 
.Coming up update more information in 2017 over 600.000 Rohingyan have been flee to the Bangladesh and more than 4000people have been killed brutality by Burmese military and Buddhist.
Rohingyan people  still more and more continuously fleeing to the Bangladesh   . It's last step taken Burmese military genocide to the poor innocent Rohingyan people.",0,DXWAQuUc6j8

KO YE ONE,"During colonial time, the British Government conducted nationwide census in Burma and there was no record of ethnicity ""Rohingya"" in the census reports. Do fact checks in the old news papers, census reports and university literatures in the British libraries.

It's too late to deceive the world with a new invented ethnic name that didn't exist before 1948. 

Those Bengali adult people used to come across the border into Rakhine state for working in the paddy fields in 2 seasons a year, planting seasons and harvesting seasons. They tried to save money during those 2 working seasons and during off seasons they went back to their homes in now Bangladesh. Rakhine state was prosperous and it was too costly for them to live in. 

Those people are illiterate and not able to learn, read nor speak Burmese Language. If their claims of living in the Rakhine state for generations are really true, majority of those people should be able to read, write and speak Burmese National Language. They speak Chittagonian, one of the dialects spoken inside Bangladesh.

The British armed local Rakhine and those Bengali people for Japanese resistance during the second world war. After having arms from the British, those Bengali people came up with a Mujahidin rebellion against the Burmese government that gained independence from the British Colonial rule. 

They failed the ambitious plan of getting autonomy, an independent state and annexation to then so called East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).

This is the time those muslim people in the northern Rakhine state have to drop their new ambitious evil plans of making the region one of the Islamic Caliphates without having contented with the status quo. 

Those people do not even have their own written language so before the recent attacks on Myanmar Border Police Posts, those muslim militants and helpers in the villages communicated with only voice mail messages using the mobile phones among themselves. 

Burmese government has intercepted and gathered enough intelligence information to act appropriately. Those people use mobile phones with Bangladeshi mobile networks and Bangladesh has now banned Rohingya using mobile phones. 

Those Rohingya supporters in the outside world are acting blur and actually they know what exactly those people are doing by getting donations from some Middle Eastern Countries. 

Today's advanced science and technology can examine, identify, solve the mystery and reveal the truth. Ancestry DNA check on those people in the Northern Rakhine State can easily prove that they belong to Chittagong and elsewhere in Bangladesh.

Han Maung,"Why adverse comments from muslims? 

Firstly, even though Myanmar government gave citizenships and equal rights to many immigrant so called Rohingyas, their desires still cannot be fulfilled. They want to make Rakhine state their own state. They want to falsely claim that they are the native people. They allied with Taliban as well as Al Qaeda, and they want to kick Rakhine people out of Rakhine state. They want to govern Rakhine state as their own state.

Secondly, the only freedom of belief in Islam is the freedom to become Muslim; blindly following their Wahabism and ""muslim ummah"" and devoid of critical thinking. Thus, there is no way for a muslim to reform or assimilate and advance forward or freeing themselves towards a common humanity and morality. People who have left Islam were Muslims for many years or decades, and their insight and warnings are particularly eye opening, frightening, insightful, and more. Ali Sina, Ayan Hirsi Ali, Hassan Mosan Yousef, Nonie Darwish, Brigitte Gabriel, Wafi Sultan, Salman Rushdie, Ibn Warraq are all highly recommend - read their books, watch their youtube videos, see their websites.....

Thirdly, if Buddhists (or Buddhism) were at fault, they should probably be attacking Christians and Hindus too. At least some type of discrimination against Christians which is the 2nd largest religious community in Myanmar which has never happened In fact. Hindus have suffered a large brunt of recent islamic terrorism. Christians and Hindus, the 2nd and 4th largest communities, by population, are integrating just fine",11,g1MoehFI3io

Shrihari kulkarni,"The conflict in the region arises chiefly from social differentiation and conflict between Rohingya Muslims and local Rakhine Buddhists. DuringWorld War II in Burma(present-day Myanmar), Rohingya Muslims (allied with the British and promised a Muslim state in return) fought against local Rakhine Buddhists, who were allied with the Japanese. Following independence in 1948, the newly formedunion governmentof the predominantly-Buddhist country denied citizenship to the Rohingya, subjecting them to extensive legal discrimination in the country, widely compared toapartheid.[according to whom?]From 1947 to 1961,local Rohingya mujahideenfought government forces in an attempt to have the mostly Rohingya populated region around theMayu peninsulain northern Arakan (present-day Rahkine State) gain autonomy or secede, so it could be annexed byEast Pakistan(present-dayBangladesh).[24]During the late 1950s and early 1960s, the mujahideen lost most of its momentum and support, resulting in most of them surrendering to government forces.[25][26]

In the 1970s Rohingya Islamist movements began to emerge from remnants of the mujahideen, and the fighting culminated with the Burmese government launching a massive military operation namedOperation King Dragonin 1978.[27]In the 1990s, the well-armedRohingya Solidarity Organisationwas the main perpetrator of attacks on Burmese authorities near the MyanmarBangladesh border.[28]",0,9t96L3uUB5k

Karen Karen,"Grassed up: Facebook leads Myanmar police to weed-growing Americans
AFP AFPApril 25, 2019
Police raided the 20-acre site in Ngunzun township to find nearly 350,000 marijuana plants - after being tipped off by photos on Facebook

More
Myanmar police have arrested one American and two locals after photos on Facebook led them to a huge plantation of towering marijuana plants near Mandalay.

Pictures of the fields of weed started circulating on the platform last week -- a rare sight online in a country where police photos of seized heroin and methamphetamine are far more common.

Police raided the 20-acre site in Ngunzun township Monday to find nearly 350,000 marijuana plants -- some up to two metres tall -- 380 kilograms of seeds and 270 kilograms of marijuana, the Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC) announced Wednesday.

A released photo showed arrested US citizen John Fredric Todoroki, 63, standing alongside Myanmar nationals Shein Latt, 37, and Ma Shun Le Myat Noe, 23.

Another man, 49-year-old Alexander Skemp Todoroki, is still ""at large"", the CCDAC said.

Police confirmed he is also American.

The detainees have been charged under the Anti-Narcotics Drug and Psychotropic Substances Law, though it remains unclear what penalties they will face if found guilty.

""We didnt know this (marijuana plantation) existed,"" one local police officer told AFP, asking not to be named.

""We only found out when we were tipped off about it.""

Seizures of heroin, pills and crystal meth by authorities are more common in Myanmar, where weak rule of law and conflict-riddled border areas allow for the industrial-scale production of harder drugs.

Reaction on Facebook was swift, with some offering high praise for the arrests.

Others questioned how the pot growers had been able to get away with it for so long.

""How could the plants have grown so big without you allowing it?"" Facebook user Kg Zoe Law commented at the police.

But not everyone's nose was put out of joint by the agronomists' antics.

I am not saying what myanmar military did was right.I am burmese and I know how corrupted myanmar military actually is.

Rohingya is not an ethnic,they are Bangali( immigrated from

 accept them back. There is no problem if they love different cultures 
(especially buddhists' culture) and want to coexist peacefully. But 
their birth rate is increasing rapidly and ambitiously. Now, there are 25,553 Rakhine nationals and 444,390 Bangalis 
living in Maungdaw,and 46,192 nationals and 230,000 Bangalis in 
Butheedaung. Now, they make an ethnic name and claim for citizenship but
 they deny Myanmar's Citizenship law as  they realize there is no 
possibility of acquiring a nationality. So, they start islamization and 
exploiting Myanmar Crisis with Fake,fabricated by the help of muslim 
countries and wastren medias(like OIC and UN,etc..).A lot of burmese 
buddhist girls murder and rapes  by Rohingyas (Bangali) muslim for a 
long time. But I never seen about that on any medias. Why? Simple, Most 
of the countries on the world are Islamic countries. We coexisting with 
our christian ethnic like Karen, Kachen, Chin without any religious 
problems. Myanmar have a lot 
of foreign immagrants like indians, Napalese, Chinese and so on. We are 
coexisting with them without any problems for a long time. Why? They 
respect our cultures and don't claim for citizenship and ethnic. They 
don't want to invade our land.That is why~~and why? why???? Why did they
 destroy buddhism's honour and image? But I still loving our minority

Mitsu Saha,"First of all i am a human and I felt the pain of those people crying in the video it made my eyes moist and my heart heavy. Majority has done and are doing their job why just Burma take the example for Bangladesh and Kashmir where thousands of Hindus were killed and thousands have fled the same way. Now I am not justifying here or taking sides. Those who got killed, tortured and chased are poor people and above all humans like you and I. I am extremely sad after watching all these videos of violence. If we go back to history Muslims were never part of that society hence it will be obvious for a particular group which is racially, ethnically, and religiously different being attacked. Acceptance, tolerance, awareness, recognition and respect towards each other can only solve this problem in Burma. Regarding the person and his team who went for the interview and documentary or fact finding thing one thing i must say Thank you for showing me the other side of the coin as well, now i know that violence effects the minority the most. But a small suggestion also take some steps in your country as well. Also check whether your country has the same policy or your people in your country treat the minorities or immigrants the same way because if they do you must know what pain they have been through to reach there and what they aim and hope to receive from you. I don't support  the Buddhist here the Muslims have now become very much part of their country and they must make strong laws to make everyone safe and equal rights be given to every one. I am from India and in my country some crazy Muslims and Hindus live but they cannot go berserk because our laws are strong. Its a racial thing here in Burma more than religion for example if all of them (Muslims) were Hindus and by appearance they did not look mongoloid they would face the same consequence as the Muslims did. Anywhere in the world even in America religion will come into play always..

""Hatred is never appeased by hatred in this world. By non-hatred alone is hatred appeased. This is a law eternal."" (Dhp I - 5)





""One who, while himself seeking happiness, oppresses with violence other beings who also desire happiness, will not attain happiness hereafter."" (Dhp  X - 131)





""Overcome the angry by non-anger; overcome the wicked by goodness; overcome the miser by generosity; overcome the liar by truth."" (Dhp XVII - 223)





""One should not strike a holy man, nor should a holy man, when struck, give way to anger. Shame on him who strikes a holy man, and more shame on him who gives way to anger."" 


""He who does no evil in deed, word and thought, who is restrained in these three ways  him do I call a holy man."" 


""Not by matted hair, nor by lineage, nor by birth does one become a holy man. But he in whom truth and righteousness exist  he is pure, he is a holy man.""(Dhp XXVI - 389, 339, 391)





""He abused me, he struck me, he overpowered me, he robbed me."" Those who harbor such thoughts do not still their hatred.

""He abused me, he struck me, he overpowered me, he robbed me."" Those who do not harbor such thoughts still their hatred. (Dhp I - 3,4)",1,ccRw96mOwTc
Holy Nightwing fan,"Those people are not real buddhists! Differently from other religions scriptures there is NONE that supports discrimination! Buddha was even against the caste system!

""Not by matted hair, nor by lineage, nor by birth does one become a holy man. But he in whom truth and righteousness exist  he is pure, he is a holy man."" Dhp XXVI-393

Nigrodha, you may think: The contemplative Gotama says that just to get more disciples. But you shouldnt think that way. May your master remain your master. 

Or you may think: He wants us to abandon our rules. But you shouldnt think that way. May your rules remain the same. 

Or you may think: He wants us to abandon our way of life. But you must not think that way. May your way of life remain the same. 

Or you might think: He wants us to do things that according to our teaching are wrong and are considered by us to be. But you shouldnt think that way. May those things that you think are wrong continue to be considered that way. 

Or you may think: He wants to keep us from those things that according to our teaching are correct and are considered by us to be like this. But you shouldnt think that way. May those things that you think are right continue to be considered that way. Nigrodha, I do not speak due to any of these causes ...


There are, Nigrodha, awkward things that have not been abandoned, contaminated, that lead to rebirth, terrifying, that produce painful results in the future, associated with birth, aging and death. It is for the abandonment of these things that I teach Dhamma. 
If you practice accordingly, these contaminated things will be abandoned, and the things that lead to purification will develop and increase, and you will achieve and remain, performing for yourself in the here and now the fullness of the perfection of wisdom.  (DN 25)",0,ccRw96mOwTc

Seed Lord,The comments here are disgusting and abhorrent. The Rohingya have been in Myanmar for centuries yet they are called illegal immigrants. They were asked for proof of ancestry in order to gain citizenship yet the government razes the only places they can possibly get evidence from as individuals. People justify an ethnic genocide by claiming an entire ethnic group should be prosecuted because a pathetically small decimal of a percentage of people who share the same faith have committed terrorism. A religious Buddhist figure in Myanmar claims that Muslims will become like Jackals if they ever become strong yet he says so without the slightest self awareness as to how his people have been committing inhumanly cruel acts unbefitting of any animal. If you don't care about what I said then fine. But what of the kids? the babies who drown while trying to get to safety from murder? Must they suffer because of what ever unreasonable hatred you have to the Rohingya as an ethnic peoples?,8,ccRw96mOwTc

On a moral scale, the genocide of the Rohingya, these crimes against humanity, are tantamount to the genocide of Jews by the Nazis. 1) The world ignored the evidence they were quickly becoming aware of. 2) The world felt it was none of their business if some ethnic or religious group get killed so long as it doesn't land on their doorstep. 3) World leaders turn their backs. The United Nations is typical in its paralyses, but largely doesn't care, so long as they get their paychecks. 4) Mass graves have just been reported and 2 reporters are in all likelihood ""disappeared. 5) Aung San Suu Kyi has shown herself to be a narcissist hypocritical war crimes collaborator  she should be stripped of her Nobel ""Peace prize. Her name will live in infamy. She is ow an unindicted war criminal. 6) The Burmese military junta is using HIV as weapon of war, to commit genocide. They order their soldiers, especially those with AIDS or HIV to rape the Rohingya with impunity. 7) The military junta has as its aim to Burmacize the population through rape and genocide. 8) In a world climate where Trump has declared war on Muslims there is little hope that the US will use any of its power or will to intercede, thus making it complicit in the murder of children, the rape of girls and women, and the genocide of the Rohingya and Karen peoples  for trump this is par for his course.

Test Konto,"I spent the last hour reading up on this matter.
- The Rohingya are deprived of the right to free movement and the right to higher education. 
- They have been denied Burmese citizenship since the Burmese nationality law was enacted. 
- They are not allowed to travel without official permission.
- They were previously required to sign a commitment not to have more than two children, though the law was not strictly enforced. 
- They are subjected to routine forced labour. (Typically, a Rohingya man will have to give up one day a week to work on military or government projects, and one night a week for sentry duty.)
- The Rohingya have also lost a lot of arable land, which has been confiscated by the military and given to Buddhist settlers from elsewhere in Myanmar.
Then the myanmar goverment has the gall to say that they want them out because they commit more crime? Ofcourse they do! They have no other options for fucks sake.

And people who are talking about deportation, do you all know your histories? Migration and immigration is not new. What if someday humanitarian crisis affects us to a large scale and nobody is ready to help us. Have any of the haters here who are supporting deportation felt helpless and fearful?  If you don't, please don't say something like that. FYI population of India is very large and all but rohingya our not in that big in numbers, why fear that it will increase population when they are not taking much space in economic and social sphere.",1,vCIgWD89xkc

I really feel sorry for them becoz this  type of wrong judgements create problems. The Rohingyacrisis is a matter of concern for every human being but then these crisis should be resolved by the concerned parties (theLeadership of Myanmar & Rohingyas & the Buddhists). At last I would say that before commenting on India they should also take in consideration the very fact that India has accepted many immigrants then any other nation 
1) consider zorastarians from Iran travelled all the way to India 
2) Jewish as they say ""India is the only place where we have not been persecuted"" rest of the thing is clear
3) Bangladesh - Millions of Bangladeshi refugees arrived in India even many of them have become Indian citizens.
I think atleast west should not teach us moral lessons  as everyone knows 
1)Jewish were treated as untouchables all over the Europe 
2) Germans were regarded inferior mostly in France

It is easy to stay abroad and make sweeping comments about a country and claim authority over the same just because of ancestry or heritage. India's economic growth has slowed down and there are millions who are anxiously waiting for jobs and social security. Who is going to get jobs for Rohingya's while the citizens are jobless? It is putting strain on over burdened economy. Also, India has its own aspirations with respect to South East Asia. There is an urgent need to open North East for trade and Myanmar is the gateway to South East Asia. There are also issues about insurgency and India needs co-operation of the Myanmar Government. None of these issues were touched upon by the respected guest and the rhetoric of anti muslim sentiments were played out without proper research.

They cannot carve out land for themselves and then move into other people's land. It is disgraceful that Pakistan has not taken in any of the current set of Rohingya refugees when the very creation of their country was to be a homeland of these people.",5,oszU253t6gw

However, Mr. Owaisi, I do not hear any strong speech or concern from you against the ouster of Kashmiri Pandits from their homeland and they are living like refugees in their own country! I am asking you, what duty have you shown towards rehabilitating these Kashmiri Pandits.  Moreover, we are a country with massive population and we have our own problems to resolve, we cannot take more burden of taxation to feed them in the name of seculiar or democracy! I have a suggestion, why don't you provide food, shelter, love and compassion  to at least 10 - 20 Rohingyas refugees  by opening your house door to them, you can surely afford to do so, can't you, till the center decides something for them!",0,THPTyAiopd0

Juan Carlos Rodriguez La Santa,"This proves that religion and government should be divided. Religion should be used to foment your moral values and government to create the rules of society. If religion fails to teach good moral values you end destroying the society you want to create. A religion that speaks of segregation of the people based on religious belief should never be used as a means of government. No religion should be used ever as a means of government; period. A society without a central government will inevitably collapse. A society should be ruled based on rules that constitute the will of the people of that society; named a constitution. They ruled themselves by Islam and the price of ruling themselves by religion is, the collapse of what they want to accomplish. You either take a religious book to rule a country or make a constitution that is fair and up to date, to create a society. Islam does not respect life. What kind of society do you want to create with a religion that is so divided? Not even a chaotic society, because religions are made of rules that are too stiff and depend on the belief that changes from person to person. On one side religion impose ruling by obeying a supreme being, whose rules written in a book, may come from a supreme being or from a bunch of murderers, thieves, sexual predators, criminals, or psychopaths. On the other side, a constitution is made by people with objective thinking and moral values, that encompass the needs of every individual in a civilization. The reason why society can not be ruled by religion.",16,nv-4LcvedOI

1275783508 Thanga,"Myanmar Muslims have well established Mosques and temples and most of them are in central Burma. They speak Burma's official language Burmese language very well. So called Rohingya Muslims are simply illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. 


---- Most of them are descendants of Bangladesh Vs Pakistan war refugees in 1970s. Most of them are anti-establishment of Bangladesh and sympathizers of the united East and West Pakistan nation. 

----- Rohingya of Bangladesh migrants are trying to be recognized as one of Burma's ethnic nationals instead of going through the law of the land. That kind of falsifying claim and campaign backfired their dream to come true, and even lost the possibility to get permanent residency. 

--- Muslims around the world should learn that false claim doesn't work anymore in this social network era and please start telling the truth that will help your daily status and will earn compassion of other religions! Nobody likes liars (by nothing concerned to religion) but the liars themselves. 

---- PS: India and Bangladesh intelligence communities intercepted three long phone call between high ranking Pakistan intelligent officer and leader of ARSA (Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army) before ARSA terrorist group attacks at 30 Burma security outposts on August 25, 2017.
