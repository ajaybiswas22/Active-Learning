"I find it absolutely ridiculous that tv anchors spinning it like Modi is the hero behind the farm laws repeal. They should be ashamed that they are giving the credit to Modi instead of the farmers  who have been protesting on the streets for more then a year, it's a blood shame, I come to hate Modi and his bunch of sycophant more and more everyday,"
"First of all, the mandi system is the reason why our farmers have suffered all these years. Contract Farming provides farmers with all the necessary  items required. The farmer receives high quality seeds from the company, moreover, a farmer can decide to break the contract at any given time. Even, before these bills were passed, PepsiCo had entered into agreements with several farmers in Punjab. No farmer had any problem with the private contractor. This new system provides farmers with a wide range of market price. Regarding, the essential co.modities bill, the initial act was brought in when the country had a deficiency of resources. Today, thanks to the Green revolution, India produces more than the sufficient requirement. This bill was previously preventing companies from purchasing goods in excess from the farmers to store it. The amendment changes that. Please don't spread fear among the people like this."
if Modi is serious for apologies he should compensate all farmer for their 1 year suffering each farmer family 1 lac rupee... give reservations in govt jobs to all farmers.....give free electricity.... give farmers education quota in all colleges.... farmers are the only true God ...they are annadata... jai kishan parivaar... shame bjp govt
Seller want minimum support price
Pakistan. Or  taliban  ka Hindustan par. Qabza.. ho gaa bohat jaldee....Bollywood janta or Bollywood indian armey...stupid PM...google report....a tea man
The indian MUSLIMS helping them wow 
"These laws will be good for agriculture but bad for farmers. 95 % of small land holders will have to exit farming and join the ranks of daily wage earners. On the other hand  , agriculture and traditional farming as we know today will die a natural death. A new order will replace the existing one."
Same way Modi will say SORRY again on 370.. Loot India Gujju model want Kashmir not Kashmiris..
Jai shree ram Jay yogi baba ke vote for bjp
Congress is milking this episode like anything -  May not help in  UP election ..  People of this country are fed up with Dynastic politics  who are born politicians.  Now  this big    NAATAK  is  very much see through  and any one can see the  objective of congress  here -  UP  electorate  should   totally ignore this   Congress  Drama bhaji.
"He has Afghan roots, Taliban teachings..yet married a Jew, lead a fashionable life and using PM role to manifest his true ideologies...He needs to worry about Pakistan if Taliban willingly takes it from Pak Army, PTI"
Log samjh nahi skta h  others County se log twitter key tha  kise aak ke chalte pura india farmers ka nuksan 
farmers are the second mother of every human being government should think twice on laticharge attacking farmers and senior citizens is not good
let the free market prevail modi/bjp
Not only punjab haryana and up 
Taliban is just Apni Gulli ka Sher.. and why would India intervene..?? this threats mean nothing. They will never dare to come to Indian Borders...
Those are khalistanis. Farmers are with the country. These shameless people are Against India.
"Ye congress,sp vipacch Ka BJP ko harane Ka "
Shame on bjp government since 60 days past they.cannot take.decission don't blame the farmers they are half brain with frustration  why such government wait.till.datr
"SG, I think the media has failed in its duty as the fourth estate. The media should have communicated the benefits of the farms laws - instead it was more interested in presenting a showdown between the farmers and the government."
"Lands from them . This two way work is functional in many developed countries. If you think you are educated then first have a research on this then mark your opinion because your opinion can change someone else. And tell me why only 6% farmers are against of it the reason is that they are wealthier section of farmers who do not need any change but farmers of jharkhand Bihar like States need new ways .Now our India is at a verge of development in all over world , we are becoming global leaders so some anti national elements are working to change this government anyhow by hook or by crook."
If violence is the only way to get attention of the common people and international media then I am proud what farmers did was right and I would have done the same thing
3. MSP is the life line for farmers when the price goes down below the cost of production. Of course nothing has been done to it.
Nobody never ever support these broker middleman mandi walas protest funded by congress. Encounter them all atleast real farmers will trade peacefully
"Its been six months now Protest still going on peacefully. government and godi media tried to manipulate and call them terrorist but truth never dies please guys support them do tweets on Twitter because this is your right to speak right to say In democracy, and read about your rights."
Every poor farmer are with yogi and bill
Imo indian govt should rectify these laws in some way to restrict pvt companies so that they can't exploit farmers. There are too many loopholes that can exploit the small scale farmers & farm land will eventually fall in the hand of those companies.
Start systematic targeting of godi media. Don't let those anchors rest peacefully.  Godi media ko kootna shuru karon.
"Y india is gifting dem such an powerfull machine 2 dem...dey r already weak.....by gifting dem such things ....v r making taliban more strong, dey will use same thing against us..."
Justice for farmers
Mr. Modi give Resignation... You are failed to give justice to our hardworking farmer's...
"Nothing MSP- in Farmers bills? Outside APMC , its not necessary- its not (deliberately) mentioned."
"2.	When I was child, our village used to export milk.  But now we are buying milk from nearby cities. Now less than 100 dairy animals in our village (Due to age, farmers are unable to maintain these animals). What next? From where do we get milk?   "
This is difference between Yogiji & RSS picked politicians. 
"BJP Is blind with arrogance,  Yogi has messed up, Yogi should resign"
love to the farmers from Canada
"Nevertheless, farmers have a genuine fear about any government's attitude, irrespective of party affiliation, in respect of MSP. This is based on their past historical experience."
We love our farmers 
Current Modi blunder is nothing to do with how the Bill was passed.
"Most of comments are godi ,bika bagera bagera media, to ye vedios kia fake he ???? protest ka ruot dia huwa tha to divert q kia?... godi media kehne walo apko logo kia dikhai de raha he ki ye shantipurna protest he...? Kela andha"
"Farmers know what is good for them...govt jitna jaldi smjhe utna hi acha h iss bat ko.... And what was the need to pass such controversial bills  during a pandemic? Govt wanted to take advantage of the situation, they thought they would be able to suppress protests.....they were wrong....they forgot punjab is the land of Bhagat Singh..."
Mr modiji shd take the guidelines of Mr Devendra Sharma  n help farmers who are pillars
I no support owasi and modi but mody 
I don't support farm laws
"If these laws are passed, it will benefit the farmers in the poorer states."
Government back this bill. I support to farmers
we are with the farmers who are feeding more than 100 crores citizens and exporting food grains to many countries.
U can kill farmers but u can't kill thier purpose
Tikait defeated Modi hurrre....
Victory to farmers of India!!
Farmers are role model for all Indians.
Shame shame shame modi govt and modi media. U all are big liar. Ja jawan ja kirsan. All this did by govt to ruin the farmers protest. Shame shame on u and govt
Delhi people also sport the farmers this is only one sector not in loss they always  battle performance then why need new lows
Kya ghinoni congress hai farmers ke aage karke farmers ke naam pe ghatiya politics khel rahi hai
Thank you Farmers. India will be ever gratefull.
"This is defeat of Corporates n Victory of Farmers ! PROUD OF MY FARMER BROTHERS N SISTERS , I Salute their Valor for their rights"
"If Modi govt likes farmers so much our Amarvathi farmers are protesting for the past 2 years, why did repeal the good farm bills, just for Punjab elections?  Modi bent his head for the first time."
Farmers Protests was peaceful
Farmers are more important then Modi
"Corrupt Govt need to stop this scam of Buying votes on the name of sending Farmers 2000rupee every 3 month, instead make MSP as law so farmers get their cost, make MW ( minimum wage ) law so general labour working in cities and metro cities in construction, renovations, cleaning , Gardners and servants and maids for rich and ultra rich & above middle Class"
APMC fullform is AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE MARKETING COMMITTEE sir.... NOT AGRICULTURE PRICE sir ... but its ok...it happens 
(Not sure if its mentioned / added in the bill but Govt ensures - MSP system and Mandis will continue.)
Answer  : - Indian  farmers 
I support farmers 
"Our Farmers did not bother anyone in Delhi, they fed Delhi homeless. They showed once again that they are the one who grow the food to feed us. Thanks to Famers to feed the whole world."
60 deaths in 40 days as protesting farmers fight the govt and the cold
It looks like he did it intentionally. My heart breaks for those farmers who died
Congratulations! To All Farmers...
The major concern is the silent farmers from other states who were in favour of these laws and against these so called farmers agitations... In India the corrupt political and dishonest people are doing everything to destabilise the government but this is not the problem.. The real problem is the majority silent spectators who are unable to raise their voices against dishonesty... The only maximum tool to show their concern is social media messages...
"Farmers are not stupid ,give them tools and income they can produce miracles "
"AAP govt should form national party all over India,and start protest with farmers adding EVM voting ka mudda."
Small farmers' interests subdued by rich farmers for their own interests.
7:20 i'd just like to say there is no provision that anyone can take their land contract farming is not about taking anyones land they clearly dont know what there talking about so basically they are being misguided. I do however agree about the farm laws decresing income of the farmers so something should be done about that.
Shri Modi ji ko salute.  He is greatest son of soil.  I share the feeling of shri Modi ji. 
One day Pakistan will also under Taliban control that day imran khan will know how Afghans has suffered
WE ARE ASHEMED OF OUR DENIOR LEADER RAJYASAVHA MEMBER & THEY DONOT HAVE RESPECT OF PARLAMENT.AS THEM WHY I CAN NOT SELL MY PRODUCT OPENLY INMARKET WHEN CAN BUY ANYWHRW BY MY CHOICE??.ONLY FARMER CAN NOT SELL!!!!!
"Aur jo factor affect karte hain iske liye vo farmers ke control mein nhi hai. Kabhi rainfall zyada ho gye, moisture increase hogya , agar nhi hui to moisture decrease ho gya, kabhi grain size pura nhi hai, kabhi ye fertilizers ki matra kam reh jaati hai, kabhi kabhi produce ko rodent kharab kar dete hai, kabhi fungus lag gye."
"Because of farmers, every household get food and because of them we are alive and it's really Shameful that farmers are not getting good support from Government. Farmers are ignored. When election comes, they say they will help farmers but after elected this is what we see as news."
"The moment u think about a neta that he is different, seconds later he disappoints u, didn't know pm modi was this spineless, swargiya Kalyan Singh ji must be very disappointed by watching pm modi tossing up values & his supporters pride like this #FarmLawsRepealed, I've voted thrice n all for modi & even now I will not vote for anyone else but now I'm thinking I will not gonna vote for modi, I think I will still out, I will waste my power, my vote becuz Modi has betrayed me"
7. Finally sell the same rice to the same farmers and INDIANS for Rs.1000/kg. 
"This is the reality . But , donot fear , we have Modi ji . He will do , he will give all the guru mantras ."
What about making the selling price to consumer and Msp interlinked at the backend and monitored by government. And only digital payment allowed to pay farmers for  transparency in the transactions
"Questions - is there a path for these middlemen/wholesaler to procure at 800 from farmers and sell it to government at MSP calling themselves ""farmers"", making a profit? Does the government do checks on such spurious trades?"
#farmerprotest sports 
1) The farmers who r involved in the protest themself lack this knowledge.
All these are political leaders not farmers how we get vegetables and crops if they are protesting for 9 months ?
"PS- Unfortunately, More than 150 farmers have died, already. Some committed suicide, some died of cold weather while protesting on out skirts of Delhi."
My salute to farmers let's election come we teach lesson to BJP
" Their demands for recognition of MSP as statutory right, whittling down of the The Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance 2020 and withdrawal of cases on farmers seems unreasonable and naive for following reasons-"
Super congratulations farmers
"Anyways the basic problem still remains, Green Revolution, GM crops & food independance. Farmers grew GM crops and stopped oil seeds & millets for the additional profits it promised."
"It is a matter of Investigation & grave concern that Congress party , AAP, Kisaan Neta- Unions & NDTV received how much money from China/ Pakistan to keep alive this so called Kisan Andolan against Indian State."
"What's the big deal its just a flag, it could have been taken off by the police later.  It's not like farmer's damaged the Red fort building. Why is the government making an issue of a trivial issue. They're acting like these farmer's are an invading army..lol!!"
I don't know how to express my gratitude. Always with them... The great warriors.. FARMERS. Remembering all the heroes who sacrificed themselves... More than 100 lost their life. These leaders may not see all those but the God will definitely punish the culprits.
Dissent is anti-national in Modi's India; I support farmers!
If Ajay Mishra would a congress person then bjp may make fire all the up to make resign Ajay Mishra
We know about other nations situation as well. So these laws will definitely not work in favour of farmers. See what adani did in Himachal.
Mohak silently said that Farm bills are good but the problem is only of trust.
One bill was coming for farmer now it will not come because of this andolon
A government aginst our own farmers..indian Hitler modiraj murdhabad corporate Bandhu Modi murdhabad black law's should be removed immediately
Shame on bjp government.. I love kishan
You can tell how well a country is doing buy how the farmers are doing
Please logo ko farmers bill padhna chahiye....reality pata chal jayega
"700 Khalistan terrorists died in Delhi farmers agitation, they're not farmers."
"JAI JAWAN JAI KISAN!! On the bday of our father of nation & Lal Bahadur Shastri our second PM, who gave the above SLOGAN , this FASCIST BJP govt has manhandled the FARMERS. Any govt which lays its hands on the FARMERS  WILL NOT COME BACK  TO POWER!!!!!!"
There are some farmers protecting police officers but no police officer is protecting any farmer.
Say no to socialism: life is difficult. Get a better job than just being a farmer and stop complaining
"There is one pitfall which has not been addressed. When a big company enters into an agreement with small entity, the company dictates the terms. The small entity ends up being exploited. Perhaps enough has not been done to safeguard the interests of farmer ."
"Good explanation, govt is right and support new farm bill"
Good decision by govt. Not compare it caa or 370 it's for Indians farmers
It's a deal between pakistan and taliban that the Pakistanis will help Taliban to capture Afghanistan and once it becomes successful the talibans will help pakistan to capture jammu and kashmir.
I am happy ..for it... Thanks for supporting Farmers..l love basic gyan
By far the best explanation I have seen on the farmer's protest.
"So arnoob are you saying that supreme leader modi lost to ""khalistani terrorists""?"
A victory to Humanity who could see Mr Modi was working for company profits with an agenda
Bang on farmers
"I am from the city in which this singhu broader is attached,Modi is an upper caste leader,most of the upper caste support this leader even if it means crushing the constitution values,he is most idiot leader,he holds a fake degree."
"What is the problem now...at starting I was also supporting farmers but when even after government removed all the previous points, now why are they protesting...."
He brought issue like farming in main stream. Addressed many problem faced by Bangladeshi farmers. 
"He is an opportunist,his wife will resign but he will continue to support bjp, nonsense"
"SG Sir, Your commentary on seven C of democracy was missing in the episode where you had analyzed and supported these farm laws. You think opposition would have agreed? I disagree. I still feel PM tried and failed to convince or say ""manage"" the situation was better than not trying but to convince opposition. I'm sure govt. think tank would have discussed this. It's better to try and fail than to take a defeatist approach."
"What a great actor, sorry orator modiji is."
I was looking for the exact issues that farmers actually have..and you explained it so well..thanks for explaining everything in a layman's language!!
Kya godi media bhul gya regarding such type of interviews.. What a healthy talks with Rakesh Tikait ji.. Wow..
Punjab ka nam jada highlight mat kro..we know iske piche Govt or media ki intentions sahi nahi h.
"I personally have just one issue with this analysis, which is to treat the word ""farmers"" as a homogeneous group. I believe all analysis on farmers' issues will become much more nuanced once we start categorising different types of farmers based on their landholdings, mechanisation, labour employed etc. The status quo definitely benefits some stakeholders (otherwise it wouldn't have existed) and any reform will hurt this category. At the end of the day, if the reform hurts the richest category of farmers marginally in the short run, while increasing the options for the most marginal category of farmers, then it comes down to who do you support in this scenario."
Can experts here tell me point wise the benefits of these laws for farmers and also address the apprehensions of the farmers regarding these laws ???????
Simple.... Bhai opposition se farmers ka brainwash kiya aur farmers ko apna wellfare chayiye hi nahi.
"I'm a Bangali, Kolkatan!!  Purely supporting farmers!!!!  May be this is the first time,  I'll get to see the real INDIAN power-parade this year...  Plz  do show us the parade. Mujhe pehele bolna para me Bangali hu to show my respect & love to my sikh community. Hum sab ek sath hain. ""JO BOLE SO NIHAL"
"Mr. Dikhit ji you call this respect person in yours DEBATE, who invective  modi ji in his words  and We are listened to CAREFULLY "
8. BJP refused to have a debate on the bills. They rushed them through.
India Supports you Punjab Farmers. Farm laws to benifit Reliance & Ambani ??
A serious wrong decision...but modi has to do it for elections
"Guys , Plz also make ur videos in hindi . Bcoz may be farmer and most citizen in india  needs to know all about this bill but they do not understand English. They are either hindi speaking or.any any regional language"
Farmers will always remain poor and Middle Man will be in Profit.
Supportingourfarmers
Also this system has been tested in western countries and farmers are suffering in those countries.
This is an inspirational story. I wish those farmers the best.
"Man these farmers could have gotten so much more support if they had hoisted our tri colour flag instead of using the flag of a religious community .By this we can understand that the people involved here had no motive of helping the farmers ,there sole motive was to create conflict and distrubt the internal peace within the country."
Farmers are very productive members  (More than 50% Indian population) of the country.
"Our respect for the hon'ble SC has increased hundred fold for their Hinduphobic stance as seen from some instances: when  poll violence was unleashed in May June , when Hindus are being lathicharged and imprisoned for protesting the putting up of Pakistani flag etc , the same court sits as mute spectator !"
What about farmers protest?   U beat them up so badly..you forgot about that   ?  Answer indo patel's.
"The police and government has been polarizing farmers protest,"
"More over coming to farmers, remember the people or troops who were in opposition of this farm law before going happy, this are the termites of 4th generation war where people fight against internally."
Shamefull govt how u treat that people who give u food that chapati u eat daily that the hardwork of farmer very very bad u have to understand them
"SG read the farm bill from top to bottom, left to right and vice versa and can't notice that the corporates are not liable if they breach the contract/agreement with the farmers as farmers complaints won't be entertained by the govt & even the court can't interfere. Wasn't this a red flag?"
Aaj Tak Godi Modia ki one of the Biggest shameless and useless channels. Their Anchors are absulately fully promoting Godi Modia's and Government agenda. Gandhi naali ka Keeda channel 
Farmers ko faltu me badnam kiya jaa raha hai.. har saal itni tight security hoti hai red fort k aas paas and delhi me bhi itni force hoti hai pr iss baar itni dheel kyu??? It's a trap !!
India will never ever grow or advance under democracy.....good luck stay poor farmers
"Farmers ko agar really help karna cahtahe sarkar Toh Government ko fertilizer, pesticides ke cost low karne ko kaho,,,,Main Kissan family se hoon pera pitaji Kissan haa"
There are there main parts in farm bill.
"Tell me only one thing! Just one!  What and why in the world, Punjabi ""farmers"" were doing and protesting on Cowbelt UP soil?!"
#FarmLaws_InjusticeByModi
"These laws enormously BENEFITTED the small and marginal farmers, but NOT the middlemen."
We are farmers who r very down 2 earth  not politicians like u kangna  who barks everytime. speak that much which others can tolerate otherwise u will have 2 pay for this
"There are many mistakes in what you're saying. Farmer can only sell his produce in his local APMC. Selling outside APMC or selling to other APMC of the state is ILLEGAL according to old law. but some states like MH, KA have policies to allow sale of some goods outside APMC. Please read the act and then make videos. You are popular so please speak responsibly"
corporate will  take away  lands of  small farmers
Breaking Bharat forces in action. Do you need any more evidence? Time to unite and support BJP even more.
Ravish is the real Iron man of New India!!
for this situation central is responsible. this is the because of negligence of govt looks on farmers protests.
"It was PDP, NC & congress which supported them not taken any action. "
"The tragedy of a democracy is that any political party can play games with the sentiments of the electorate and fiddle lies for narrow political wins. Although democracy is still the best form of governance, maybe we need changes to the structure now. I imagine sometimes, how India would have done if had followed a model like South Korea or Singapore. We talk about Pakistan because they had failed miserably but South Korea and Singapore had pretty authoritarian rulers"
Best of luck all farmers for your future.. 
I support  framers .. But today we not support farmers .. Ja galat kya kisano ne ..
What's happening with the Farmers of our country May God have mercy on deceased 
Salute to farmers
80% of Indians dont know what are these farm laws first they should know this
And that's the reason I support these bills as most Indian farmers support them (including the ones from whom I buy vegetables and grains) except the ones at Delhi protesting..
"Its a great series but I think you missed another important dimension to the solution.We should promote FPO , this will help farmers create there own system new generation farmers can use technology to sell the produce and profits can be with farmers just like Amul."
Thank you so much Dehliites for standing up with Farmers. Lots of love and blessings to you all.
APMC ... can be used as benchmark for setting MSP as a minimum procurement price for the commodities?
Ek dum unbaised. Thank you. I support government but I also support farmers . Violence is no solution. Farmers should give suggestions to improve the bill not to repeal it because it will give profit to many farmers across India. But there must be some improvements in the bill.
Kerjriwal is right. Proud to our all India Farmers.
"Similarly MSP minimum support price means, even if the quality of crop turn out to be low, Farmer can atleast recover the cost. On other hand where the quality is better, Bid to procure better quality start from MSP, let the farmer decide at what price above MSP he is willing to sell. "
"If they feel guilty, they should abandon their comfortable life overseas and join them in profession..It's disheartening to see Khalsa flag instead of Indian flar fluttering. They should speak as indian not as punjabi, haryanwi or biharis..."
Indian Government myst roll back new 3 laws if there is so much agitation
stand and making farmers scape goat.
This is see whole Indian former's support us 
Sudhirji during demonitization u support it and blamed the opposition. Economy destroyed and never regains. U just support the govt policy. Same thing happens in gst also. Small traders and industry destroyed. How can anyone believe that farmers law benefits the farmer only.
Indian democracy  failed. Stand with farmers.
"BBC should focus on the core(main ,good)  decision taken in rally about the farm law by farmer."
I always stand with farmers
"Govt should impose a line in bill that whether FCI, APMC or pvt companies... Anyone who is buying crop from farmers is can't buy at a price lower than MSP."
There are so many states are not join to the protests for bills only two states are protesting they have no problems with new law then why and what should be want to do with original Farmers. Jai Hind
Study IQ terminate that last person who made video on farm bill
FARMERS Don't NEED OUR SYMPATHY THEY NEED OUR RESPECT & WE OWE THEM THAT RESPECT
One reason why I admire and Respect Yogi Ji is due to his strict action against culprits. Definitely voting for him. 
"You should have covered the topic of how Haryana police treated farmers when their approach was peaceful ,they just wanted to protest in delhi just like other dharnas in jantar mantar."
Salute to those who were present there in Mandi House.It high time we all should show solidarity with the farmers.
Modi and cabinets ministers wanted more shares from those working hard decent living Indian farmers! Shame!
It was only hope for small farmers.
farmer doing local businesses with small farmer without regestred with government and going to door step to farmer buying cash in hand without paying tax to government this that main concern to those peoples this reason to rich middle classes Farmer  non regester business oweners are come out doing protests agnist new farmer law.
"What I don't understand and would like to know is: If agriculture involves 60% of people of our country,why it is the farmers of Punjab mainly and of Haryana,Western UP are only agitating ,when farm laws would have effect on all the farmers of our country. So the question is Do they represent the entire farming community of India?. It is also obliquely hinted as to how Late Vajpayee ji would have dealt the issue."
"So if Punjab & Haryana protest & no other major states are protesting then might be political influence. Else, entire country is mostly into farming. So country should have been burning if all are not happy with it!"
"3- Agriculture Census 2015-16 published in 2019 revealed that average size of land holdings in respective states of Punjab and Haryana is higher than the Average size of national holdings and much higher than that of the state of UP, Bihar, Odisha, WB, MP, Chattisgarh  and other states who have greater dependency of population on agriculture sector for their subsistence therefore creates a condition which coupled with the assistance during the Green Revolution and resulting infrastructure and ecosystem  favours the Punjab farmers more to the farmers of other agricultural states in terms of production capacity, volume, automation, supply on large scale and etc. "
"Fear of losing election in UP,  Punjab and other state results are visible now,  and loosing election will give cheaper petrol and diesel prices."
You should have given a little focus on the states who already have this new system implemented for a long time for e.g. Bihar. Has there any improvement in the State of Farmers of Bihar ? No.
Support to the farmers 
"A grand salute to all our beloved farmers. United we stand, divided we fall."
What about small farmers who were benefiting from these laws... Very disappointed from the govt.
Government ko kissan ki baat smajhni chahiye. We are farmer. Protect farmer.
"Don't call off the protest, until the brokers-dalals are thrown out and poor farmers get their  fair share."
Minister convoy crushed farmers to death that's the title.
Sikh community always scarifies for country and this time govt came on backfoot for our farmers brother.
This guy just helped me in farm bill school homework ....
"They r not farmers ,they r middle man...I don't no why media has not shown When rape happened at protest ,Why don't you show that how they beat those who oppose them...26 violence and red fort , damaging public properties ,blocking national highway... "
Zee media boycott
Roudys on roads no farmers.
"Im standing with these farmers, they dont have any weapons and they are suppressed by the modi government. Water cannons and tear gas should not be used..."
Going wrong with farmers.
Major concern of farmers is that gradually govt will stop buying their produce and they have to suffer current situation (Private buying at APMCs) of selling their produce at loss in Private Market also. And their concern is genuine. A legalised MSP will safeguard farmers interest and governments promises of better rates in private market which are being propagated by this bill.
"Let's be clear on this farmers protest, it is only a small percentage of farmers that protested and large numbers are the middlemen. Ask yourself this question? If this law was evil why didn't the whole farming community of the country protest, that would have made more sense? In retrospect, this is a politically motivated protest same as the CAA and NRI Bill. The people are no fools, they are well aware of it."
"Who are these dead persons, either they are farmers or others. If they are farmers,  their bank account should be checked out, weather they are beneficial of kisan nidhi or not. If they are beneficial, it should be considered that this incident is a consipiracy. High level inquiry should be exercised."
Not only dacoit be send to mental hospital but also ABP TV anchor and the owners for showing such nonsense idiot n Taliban mentality man on TV
Its was delhi police who led the tractor march to delhi fort knowingly beacause . The police wants to make bad impression of farmers on people . And godi media is doing good
The government was given 60 days to solve the problem but they didn't. So now cry and weep. It's a simple equation because government should realise that they are in power and if they can't settle the affairs of its citizens then it's of no use and especially when it's about farmers.
I will always sapot to farmer  
Farmers rocks always and full support from Bihar
Duty magistrate's might be having some real issue with the farmer 
"If we had done this once in India in the 60s with Rice and Wheat, why not this time with other produce and then gradually bring in the farm laws."
Middle men providing loans to farmers sounds silly defence to deny a bill.
"Punjabi and Haryanavi people are great and true inspiration..hope our Bengal, up Bihar, south all rise with such unity again..  love to all humanity"
India Today how low will you stoop to save BJP.
please translate in hindi..our farmersmosly donoy understand 
Congress Ke sajis Hai - 200 Farmers Sit on protest .
I stand with the farmers.
*We stand with farmers and their justice jai jawan jai kisan*
We are indian we are farmer
Police is  aggressive and You blame Kishan You are now a GODI Media India today Group 
"These are not farmers they are rioters,a farmer knows his values."
"Here's a suggestion! Invite P Sainath for an interview and discuss the farm bills, you paint a very optimistic picture of it, he has some fairly credible opposition"
"only people who dont know the farm laws will go against them. the farm laws only benefit farmers by opening up grater opportunities for them so they are not at the hands of these middlemen who are protesting who buy crops from farmers at low cost and then sell it to  companies for a heavy price. now farmers will be able to sell produce to companies directly and get a greater profit....moreover, the people protesting are all the rich farmers . even at the protests they get trucks and fit tvs in them and enjoy....GOVERNMENT IS READY TO TALK TO FARMERS UNDERSTAND PROBLEMS TO MAKE CHANGES IN LAWS IF NECESSARY  BUT FARMERS  DONT WANT TO TALK AND DISCUSS AS THEY HAVE NO POINTS"
In short the farmers have the option to sell their products wherever they get the best price - it could be a company or a direct consumer or any other market.
May be TARIK FATEH is an isi agent.  I mean you never know hmari isi kahi bhi pohunch jati he Allhamdullillah or Indian media always bewaqoof hi bnta he like now 
I mean everyone credits the sikh farmers for repealing these laws but let's not forget the Jats who were equally vocal against these laws and jats were the main vote bank for the BJP. This is just vote bank politics by the BJP
"Thank you Modi ji, article 370 hat gaya warna pura Pakistan Kashmir me bas jata. India should not trust anyone and do anything for our safety."
Essential supplying to farmers is good job but when water was not supplied in Delhi till 15 days then where had AAP party
Happy Independence DAY to INDIAN Brothers from  Brotherly Pakistan and AFGHANISTAN 
"The food donor you are calling a terrorist is yours next time. It's time, if you can't support, don't protest because the farmer is fighting not only his own battle but also yours."
The first food vlogger to visit farmer's protest well done 
I m a farmer also we need change
It was actually nothing just the anger of farmers used with wrong intentions by other political parties
All the taxes which are there they are not put on farmers if MSP is 2000 farmer sell crop at 2000 taxes are paid by buyer not farmers and APMC in Punjab are lot easy to reach with in 3 to 5 KM
"And BJP top leaders came to GHMC elections in Hyderabad, even farmers  are fighting in delhi they don't understand the problem of people they only want win and do nothing, so these is what happens if we believe in BJP"
He said give 2 options about of 101 solutions. Salute this Farmer.
Not every farmer is happy with this decision shame on PN and Haryana farmers
"Farmers bill will be benefited to farmers, the commission agent's no more role in selling of farmers crops. "
"I don't have enough economic and farming acumen to definitively have an opinion on these bills, but from this video its apparent neither does Mr shekhar."
#Farmers are feeling insecured.
"It's a miserable condition for India, but that tractor drifting skill is one helluva ride."
But apples from himachal and jammu are already transported accross india without any resistance...so what's new in this bill?
"Nice informative video but left without conclusion? 1. Is the new farm bill better or worse for country? Who will lose, who will gain?  Please add this last part. Thnx."
Congress in Punjab. Farmers of Punjab. What?
Modi ji saara drama next election ka h. Likn hm kuch nhi bhoolne wale a.we are farmers. We remember what you did in past with farmers
"Have you ever wondered that Congress is just Demoralising the people of India, no matter weather he is BJP or any other. I know congress can do nothing. If we compare Japan and India, Japan Is much more developed than our country, although it got democracy later than India. Same goes for South Korea and uhmm if you think they are small countries that you can take China as an example. China is very much developed in military and technology as well"
"National Embarassment Shame On These So Called Farmers,Can't Even Respect Tiranga"
"I dont think the intermediaries would go alltogether as the companies would still require to approach farmers for contract farming.  The companies would probably require services of these intermediaries to handle this.  Agreed, the extent of the cartelization or monopolization would go away though."
"Government  have to  make  rules  no one  andolan  stop  high wayor railway, they have  rights  but not like  that please  Modiji  make  kanun"
"*Police should stand down. They are caught in the politician puppetry Let the PUBLIC face the Farmer protesters, leaders & politicians who are protesting, disrupting traffic, creating ruckus... violence etc. Let Public face the violence, only then will the public take action against these fools and support the police*"
Support farmers #ourfarmers #ourindianfarmers
Kejriwal ji/Aam Admi party is not worried about loosing votes in Delhi. They are confident that come next election time they will offer some freebies to the public of Delhi and buy their votes again. Now Delhi paying the price of selling their votes for cheaper electricity bill. Serves them right. Nothing is free.
"2. Within 4,5 years they take monopoly over agriculture due to Contract farming Law. APMC's will gradually disappear. "
"By remaining silent, modi protected india from getting blacklisted."
"*The main reason is  ""Out of 29 seats in all India byelection bjp, rss team managed to won 12 seats only, out of 12, 5 seats in Assam. BJP, Modi, RSS, Shah, Yogi  GAME OVER*  "
"Sir, why can't the government implement these laws in all states except Punjab and Haryana?"
We need system that give space for farmers to sell at their prices and take commission..(D-Mart)...
"You should ask income will be double, not crop price  will be double. And ask him how Rakesh has accumulated so much wealth"
"I support farmers from my state of Odisha who are mostly poor in comparison to those from Punjab and Haryana. I'm neither pro farmers nor anti Government in the present protest which is mostly Punjab and Haryana centric who seems to be well off, but I have faith that the new bill with some minor corrections will bring the necessary fresh changes in the farmers from my state who otherwise are poor all along. So,  worth a try. Before anyone commenting on the topic please download the Farmers bill 2020 and study it carefully from every angle. If you want to understand what the bill projects you can see it in the explanation given as a guide to IAS studies by Dhristi IAS - Farmers bill 2020 which has explained all angles attached to the bill in 3 hours. Let better sense prevail in these trying moments of Covid - 19. "
Thank you Modi G for repealing these laws...U r a great leader.. Salute to u..1st time u made a great decision...
finally justice for the farmers
"Important reforms have been defeated twice: Land Acquisition and Farms reforms. No government will attempt these again for at least another two to three decades. Unfortunately, the farmers of non-agitating States also lost the benefit of the reforms because of the stupidity of Punjab farmers. "
Taliban to India: We'll exterminate you frm this planet
"55 days of kisaan strike ,sitting in chilling cold with their families it's high time that central govt should listen to farmers mann ki baat and scrap 3 farm bills!"
"Two Nobel laureates,  both in Economics, both open about their no-love for PM Modi, have backed this law saying it's a great way ahead for the farmers in india. I neither understand politics, not understand economics, but I believe these Nobel laureates. Still Mr Rathee wants to prove that the law was wrong. Clearly, no one values for education or expertise in this country."
Wounderfull My Heartfull Wishes To Farmers
Farmers in this country have got many loan waivers but then also they aren't able to meet their needs .
Lol still calling them farmers 
Government should take care of farmers
"Sir I never had the exposure or dream to become an IPS because I grew up in an environment where we only discussed Punjab and Khalistan. But today at age 45, i feel my life has totally been transformed and I owe you a lot. I feel not only educated but confident in most current affairs.  Love from Canada"
"Police started blocking routes, firing tear gas and lathi charge? 2 months the farmers have been ignored, time is up Modi! We are not afraid."
"Under Congress rule, Kanimozhi was sent to prison for the allegations of corruption in 2G spectrum scam. Atleast Congress took action on their ministers, however here BJP's minister son has rammed onto farmers and killed 6 yet his Father remains in post. Useless Govt!!!"
I feel very sorry for Prime Minister. He wanted to bring progress and prosperity to the farmers community. But these middlemen and arhtiyas gangs from Punjab and Western UP made his efforts go waste. The farmers from other parts of the country will never forgive Rakesh Tikait and Khalistani elements who stopped farmers from what they wanted.
Proud of you.Godi media vs reality.
*First he did for farmer's but now for the Country try to understand it in depth*
"I'm here before people start calling Trevor ""pakistani"" and ""khalistani"""
Reduced production of wheat and paddy is the only way to survive as a farmer..coz if production is less..demand is more..rates are high.. farmers should transfer from this to some non eatables products..
"If the farmer's stick fell, he is asking for forgiveness. Because there are five states elections. This banda has started showing some drama again. Look through speech and gestures, it is clearly visible."
Definitely Modiji will return the 370 and 35A of indian Constitution. 
"saw it on another channel, where one speaker asked - if farmers were to get MSP guarantee for all their produces, which would be x% above their investments, - then why would a golgappa and bhelpuri vendor not ask the same? they should also get msp guarantee and govt should buy their golgappas !!"
Every citizen of India must watch the Rajya sabha video of passing these bills.
Indian farmers we proud with u
Thanks to all opposition leaders inIndia who supported kisan movement
Why does the Government want the three Farm Bills to remain and also the Minimum Support Price (MSP). 
"m a farmer i don't mind change but there is no effort to provide awareness why change is necessary how it'll effect in good or bad , how we prepare ourselves to take most advantage from these changes."
# godi media ...why dont u identfy who was that man .....and show one program in his name .....rss gundas......
Farmers never behave in this way.
As a son of farmer. I support farmer sitting in cold.god help u.
The truth of the media revealed..... haha..... fortunately the farmer taught a lesson
Farmers  after laws repeals 
If these people are farmers then I'm an astronaut
Indian army will blow taliban
*In case someone is wondering why farmers are protesting against fwg bills;*
I want to ask why government is allow to control the price of wheat and rice.why are farmer not allow to control the price?
Congratulations to all the farmers and people of India who supported them.. love you you who supported the farmers from different parts of India... still wait for formal procedure.
this law is already impliment in behar but  not benefits for formers so farmers of punjab take right step
#isupportfarmers
Great sir..  Aap kisano ke liye fight kro.. All Indians are with you ..salute you
Driver should have killed by the farmers no matter what the consequences
There is a reason why farmers in Haryana and Punjab are better off than other states where the open markets are killing them.
Supreme Court should intervene like how they are doing on other matters prosecute all these farmer goons for spreading the pandemic in public interest Supreme Court should pass orders
Afsos. Kya hoga india ka if our farmers are denied their rights
Good way of delivering your out view....but never thinking about doing good to the farmers....did u give any solution about the problem....
Very bad done by farmers 
FARMER - Back bone to our country.
Farmers - MSP can't by guaranteed. Guaranteeing MSP means the money goes from taxpayers or Corporates pockets without any quality evaluation. A MSP range per year can be proposed based on estimated demand by Govt. (Govt.and Corporate can use data analytics and set MSP range based on historical and projected demands and make the process transparent and visible) but Kisan cannot go to court when MSP is not within the range. And no guarantee. Nobody knows accurate regional demand in advance.
"These are not farmer's... These are rioters... Pls dont call them as farmers to shame original farmer's. All farmer's leaders are responsible to this incident and tbey all should get punished, best to send them jail"
When Telecommunications was privatised they never said they are going to kill BSNL but it was put on doses slow poison and corruption within it has done it in.  Because spectrum is owned by Govt we don't understand business where in Farming farmers are the ones who produces the crop which is like Spectrum in telecommunications and if there's a dispute he can not go to court of law but has to seek remedy from a DM. That is like moving backwards for a developing country which tops the chart in most corrupt countries list
This is not farmers this is khalistani tattu...
Farmer is god for us
Feeling so proud to see dehli people for farmers support. Thanks a lot from punjab
Question. Don't you think and worry about the cartels the middle men form deciding purchase price and farmers are left with no option but sell as produce will spoil rot after sometime and the selling price plummets further down and middle men take in more money?
No votes for bjp these elections he is such a clown
"Why not modi speak out, and accept the demands of the farmer, MLA MPS ko kharidane crores of rupee hote hai lekin garib citizens and farmers ko kyun nahi.."
Happy independence day To India..... ...   from Taliban of Afghanistan
Good Modi realised that he is not king and farmers and common people are the ones who run this country
"I don't understand what was the point of stopping the farmers at New Delhi border & all this mess, if in the end they were allowed to enter the capital. "
"No ethics..... Support for farmer's.... without them we are nothing..........shame on Modi government.......This is what ""Achhe din aane waale hain'???????? Godi media...."
"I hope India knows the world is watching the way its treating its farmers, its minorities and its people they wont get away with the same things theyve gotten away with in the past so shes 1984. This time the world is watching them so the government needs to wake up and start treating its people with the respect and dignity they deserve."
"Even at his defeat, he is not accepting that his laws were wrong. Rather he is saying that he was right but farmers couldnt understand him."
"60k Afghan Talibans & Pakistan *vs* America & NATO(55-Countries Alliance), India, Israel, Afghan Puppet Government & Private Armed Forces (Black Water, etc). Russia, China, Iran and others also Support Afghan Talibans & Pakistan but they aren't directly involved in a Conflict."
Is be devoted to Modi and see India become a Dictatorship Soon very soon....
"Most of the people don't even know what the bill is all about. People are hating and supporting the bill blindly. We need farmers bill, but few adjustments can be made accordingly as per famers request. You can't simply reject the whole bill."
Minister Nd PM has not come from Sky they all choosen by the public and this Government uncaring public and farmers..This is very disgusting..one day u feel it soon
Now the opposition will also not agree on the repeal of farm law because they wanted to poltiscise for their vote bank on the farm law.
Can't trust a single word this jumlebaaz PM says. verbal assurance of repealing the draconian farm laws is just another jumla like the hundreds already made & never fulfilled.
The security of India was favored and poor farmers lost. The middleman of the farming industry won.
Namaskar ravish Kumar sir lovely prime time today victory of democracy
"If we go by explanation in video then only best option is to make MSP a legal right of every farmer. As we are already assuming that private player will be giving better rates than what government has been offering than why not set a MSP limit before hand. As per assumption only rich farmers from Punjab and Haryana are getting benefit of MSP,  then why not pass this benefit to every farmer of country by providing legalised MSP even for buying private market."
7) Apmc acted as a mediator though it collected tax it ensured MSP and now with companies dealing with farmers directly think about any legal battles that could arise and farmers has to fight in the court just like the recent Pepsis Indian farmer lawsuit.
"Why they are not fulfill farmers demand the BJP cross  every limit yr pls be safe and wear mask ,this is not right time pls be safe"
"Thousands of farmers die every single year.. no tweets by rihanna or greta on that. But the government wishes to bring new laws to increase the earnings of small farmers, a certain group starts protesting against the reforms and an ecosystem developes.."
"the farmers protesting the farm bill are not only sikhs. In Punjab and Haryana  there are Hindu farmers , Sikh farmers Muslim farmers.  in Punjab and Haryana, the farmers are not only from from jatt caste or sikhs, there are also pundits, Brahmins , and dogar farmers in Punjab.  Farmers feed the nation, big companies like Tata, Birla, Reliance, Ebany,  Adnany  . These big companies are  controlling Modi. These bills are designed to   make  each farmer compete against each other so that big companies can buy crops at lowest rate, because farmer will have no option to sell to another buyer due to logistics and resources , and  the big companies have the logistics and they  will buy at lowest cost from Farmers and  export to other countries. This  will cause  food shortage in India,because big companies will  able to export the crops to more profitable buyers in other countries and the food prices will get more expensive in india. Modi is working for the  business tycoons, and big companies. The GTS is hurting the small shops, small factories, Modi needs to be removed from his throne."
IS NOT ACCEPTABLE MODIJI
Rise of a new Era.... Our farmers are going to be the extreme winners 
I hope everyone understand the situation of the farmers and stop calling them anti-nationals it is not good for the country and other neighbouring countries can take advantage of that.
"What will change for farmers , nothing .  Farmers can enjoy gulami of mediators."
The truth on the ground is that people like this law and the Government after looking at the acceptance level they are not trying too hard to resolve this issue. The reason behind that is that these so called farmers are only asking for repeal and once a decision is made and if it is good for the Nation then Modi is not going to repeal it no matter how much this escalates.
"We don't see Punjab Kisan leaders , which were generally all the time were seen in the past surrounding Mr. Tikait.  Ex CM, Amarinder is trying to break them out. "
The farmers are more educated and Intelligent than our Prime Minister and Home Minister...What the farmer said are all well said...
Educating farmers is wonderful point.
"Why Farmers still Committed ""Suicides "" before Laws ?"
farmers good power show
Please support our government. PM Modi and Home Minister have shown so much patience. Most of them are not farmers but terrorist and anti social elements. Just see the way they behaved on Republic Day.
Farmers have become new Kashmiris.
Centre should immediately call a meeting with farmer and eradicate the bill as soon as possible 
Not Victory it is faliure for farmers
Absolutely unbelievable decision..not required..modiji yeh kta kiya apne
"Every INDIAN if you are a true patriot in its real sense can be proud of a journelist like Ravishji ,for getting into the grass root and making us aware for not to be too late in keeping up our democracy."
"The print is supported by the special interest, and you are working for them. The long term plan is to get rid of most farmers and let big private corporation run the farms just like in western countries. Then the farmers have to work for them on minimum wages. The rest of them have to go to cities and live in small flats and pay rent and depend on the government for their living. This drama has already happened in western countries, and now is happening in India."
"as usual...no discussion with ministers, no committee, no consultation with experts, no meeting with farmers... just come on TV and announce it,"
India having 28 states and 7 ut now the que is why only 2 state farmers are doing protest not other 26 states and 6 uts. This law is applied to whole country . Now understand the chronology . Some countries funding for this protest . 
"The wheat farmers in Punjab grow poison(most of them). The government for many years has been a garbage dump for them, they sell to govt wheat for 30 and the govt further sells the crop for 2-3. The wheat crop is grown with large amounts of pesticides and fertilizers that no company can ever buy that stuff. This is the main reason why these farmers started the protest, in fear that if govt stops buying their crops then who will."
We hats off to the farmers
Farmers Won...
Credit of high income of Punjab and Haryana is not because of the efficiency of current structure. That is because of the concentration of centre aid to farmers in these two states and Bihar on the other hand hand has very small land holdings...small and marginal farmers are vulnerable in Punjab and Haryana also only middle man benefit from the existing system and they are acting as pressure group to stop the reforms.
"Respected Ravish sir, I know it's hard time for you as a real journalist but things will change soon God willingly and you also know that people are with you cause you are good man and Love our beautiful country India & it's democracy. "
So basically the farmers want to remain how they are... They fear change since that will bring uncertainty.
*Farmers >>>LOST*
"Hence, Govt must ensure that Private Sector as well as APMC can't purchase corp from farmers below MSP. Made a healthy auction. Set a base price for a corp (that is MSP), then who have the power they will buy from farmers. Thus it will create a open competitive market for buyers and also a fair mechanism for poor farmers. "
Very good farmers i hope you'll get rich now right? India is a failed democracy accept it or not.
I admire the commitment of these farmers.
"Mahapanchayat of dalals, not of farmers. Farmers are being hoodwinked by these people, led by Tikait named dacoit."
They forget that which food they eat   it made by farmer
"Please form a political party with name KISAN MAZDOOR PARTY INDIA and participate in MP elections and also in different states assembly elections like Punjab 2022 and Haryana. Be your own boss rather than looking towards corrupt traditional parties. If aam admi party can form govt in Delhi then why can't you. After independence this is first time so many people from different states gathered under one umbrella, so try to avail this golden opportunity. If Kisan can manage this Dehli Morcha peacefully and properly why can't they run a country."
sir please make a video on taking back of farmer bill by govt. please...
Its really disgraceful that for winning elections in up he came backfoot in three law of farmers  this has put the image of Our prime minister that for continuing prime ministers chair he can also go backfoot
Haryana and Punjab have better AMPC system then other states
"Before you give flak against the farmers, ask where your true loyalties lie. The union of India and her people, or the RSS and their political wing, the BJP?"
Not seVERAL STATES JUST PUNJAB AND HARYANA
The Indian farmers are treated well  by the BJP and co .
0:58 there was 90% of farmers in delhi 
Earlier I was very perplexed about this law...Why there is tussle between Govt and Farmers ? Why farmers are protesting and Why Govt is not revoking this law. But Now I'm happy that all my doubts cleared  through your lecture . Really It  helped me to understand the crux of the matter . You r such a outstanding teacher. 
"Secondly, if govt is allowing state govts to regulate private mandies then how will the make any difference to farmers, state govt are already controlling the APMCs and in your opinion they are not good for farmers"
Sorry Modiji we dont deserve you. These laws which we required so very much had to be repealed due to dirty dirty politics of Congress.
Repealing laws is not  going to help bjp gain ground in coming elections. Modi is too late to announce this.
"Unfortunate really it's unfortunate,taking back  the very helpful bill,so sad.....these farmers will never understand n they want to stay under dark only...so sad"
I am from Bangladesh and I strongly support the farmers all over the Indian Subcontinent.
"As if only Punjab and Haryana have farmers. The rest of the country's farmers who were to benefit escaping clutches of the Mandis. Screw them right? Political exigencies over ride the legal, factual and overall high ground the Govt had held. You have stand for ideology and aims. It what brought and keeps the BJP in power. This is weak."
If APMC has 500 square kilometre area then why govt. provide new mandies to reduce this covering area.
India needs a better government who can think for the interest of Indian farmers and youth.
Why don't you show video before violence where farmers were crushed by car bias media dalal media
Thank you BBC for a better coverage as asking the dumb farmers spokesman the right questions as some of your coverage on issues regarding India have been biased.
"Its simple. Let farmer protest becz its their rights, and govt must listen to them becz its their duty."
Or are those farmers also into same turmoil in the hands of a big company?
"2. All electric tractor, rotavator, harvester, thresher like farm equipments."
I would had also cleared all the roadblocks these so called farmers have made....
Agar yeh desh muslim hota tho Rakesh  fuss ho gya hota
"Like India always comparing itself with Pakistan and showing that we are growing faster than Pakistan, irrespective of other countries growing faster than us. similarly BJP always showing we are doing better as compared to UPA irrespective of amount of production."
What is going on respect farmers so sad after looking this news
"""Protest against farm laws, Politics or Farmer welfare"""
"Sir,bill no where says about msp,APMC closure etc. But indirectly  causes closure/end of same.if YouTube channel subscribers are left with choice to subscribe only one channel in youtube,the person who offers best content or better price, slowly gets maximum subscribers and such subscribers will have no option but leave your  YouTube channel. According to me atleast."
When Muslims were targeted in CAB and they protested for their rights against CAA they were called Jihadis and Pakistanis. And now when farmers from Punjab are protesting for their rights. They're being called Khalistanis.
Good information about farmer
Why south farmers should suffer for duffer and broker of north india? No south state farmers protested and we have to suffer without reforms? Make seperate laws for south india and we dnt want foolish north indian politics!! We need farm laws which is long pending request...
Kisan indian hai aur tumlog deshdrohi ho.. shame on indian media rip to truth and reality...
"Le Congress :- we will help arrested people free of cost in court and will donate blanket in jail and will still say that ""DANGA TOH BJP KE GUNDO NE KIYA RED FORT PE"" "
"In present case, big farmers for some perceived losses have organised the farmers who are supposed to benefit from the reforms. Moral: Disturbibg status quo has its own perils."
"If Indian farmers block traffic and protest in my country like that, I will send my request to government to expatriate them."
States had different rules & regulations 2buy food grains frm farmers. It was difficult 4corporates 2handle so many states with so many different regulations & taxes
These are not farmers. They are black mailers.
Farmers have won bless them 700 have died and now on our Guru Nanakji gurprab modi as done a u turn asking the farmers to go back home but farmers will stay until they get in black and white 
jab ye job laga hoga to he must have said that he is a farmers son and aage jo ager ye election ladega to bolega that he is s farmers son.baki bich me jiski lathi uski bhes
spoken like a true novice. The farmer issue is all about self interest of some people and political parties. If it was about the good of farmers the issue would have been buried.
@ 3:22 It is not called Kamataka its called Karnataka for a second you had me worried that did India get another state which I did not learn about.  One more thing I haven't seen another video from Vox when there was farmers protest back in 2017 was it because it was from a different part of India ?  It is very difficult to gauge which protests and videos are politically motivated and which are not.
"Priyanka should conduct Radhyatra through out U.P demanding Justice for All victims of Yogi Government (farmers killed, Safia (Rabia) brutal rape and murders , Hathras victims, killing of innocent people by Sangis etc)."
"The news came first, the incident happened later. The flag on the glimpse of Punjab on the 26 January parade was the one which was hoisted on the Red Fort. This is not a flag, it is Nishan Sahib. Because of this Nishan Sahib, the Khalsa Army liberated the daughters and sisters of India from Ahmed Shah Abdali and kept the shame of India. This is the Nishan Sahib whose divine principle closed the North East borders forever to end 1000 years of slavery of Hindustan."
Rakesh tikait g real hero of farmers
"The riots that are happening in India somewhere  media like Aaj tak, Zee news also has a very important role in it... Whatever be the situation in the country they never forget to defend government because they are not journalist they are paid actor of government..."
Pls dont abuse hard working honest sikh farmers.
"Mr. Imran Khan is honest man, he truly deserves to be prime minister of Pakistan.  He is right about Taliban."
Please just add one thing in your Bill that is MSP for the sake of farmers . Why you dont do this?
There are many more farmers in India then  these protesters who support to the law
What a solidarity that these hands that feed billions have shown! Time for people to learn and stand against the repressive politicians around the world. A massive thank you to every farmer 
Jay hind Yogi Ji
Up haryana punjab Rajasthan elections k jalwa hai yeh  bcoz of your decision innocent people died for no reason
"Get out of your comfort zone and face the reality, these farmers are fighting a bigger war not just for themselves but for everyone of us. Lets support them now so we don't regret later on."
Salute All Indian Farmers 
Greetings to all our valuable farmers*
Farmers of India = 1
The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill
Congratulations to all Farmers whose dedication have resulted in reality..
"We the people of India never feel better towards EVM Scammer rulers  repeal of farmers law, it's like crazy crocodile tears and double faced Snakes playing role, suppose if research from ground survey speaks nearly 10 crores farmers signed Contract Farming papers, intellectual estimate, evaluate realize later FUTURE facts TRUE PREDICTION be recorded this comment, in other words Modi RSS won the match surgical strike dramatic footage,"
The number  of farmers on agitation were negligible in comparison to   our huge population and that to a limited states    so it is really splendid  what made the central govt to bent down  it is so happened due to our weak  administrative system  the states are equall
"3. In the 3rd bill, as per the Essential commodity act, one cannot horde food items beyond a certain limit now that limit have been struck off which means there is no limit on how much one can buy and horde. No wonder why certain Adani n Ambani are on a warehouse building competition spare across India much before the bill was passed."
"That's why in Russia people are supporting Navalny, Arab Spring happened, Trump' s Qanon is exposed and Trump is out. Please don't advocate Sam, Dam... ( Chankya niti). We need to bring morality in life and politics. At least good hearted people should not support it and ask better from their leaders. Sam, dam...brings selfishness, greed and puts country and humanity behind. Country becomes week overall. We must be responsible politicians and people. We all must reject ( and not "" enjoy"") sam, dam...niti. "
If democracy ko bachana then farmers ki support kro sabb
"The people who attacked others cars and beat them are not farmers , they are hooligans and they belong to just one place which is prison.."
Do you have data like over a period of 10 years how much farmers weath against middlemen
All farmers will become rich 
Will it not encourage more such unlawful  agitations  of blocking roads indefinitely  going forward to repeal any law by  any group of persons who has objections on any law  but do not want to discuss or listen to courts ?   as this has now set a dangerous precedent to all such agitators. Even after this announcement the strikers are indicating that the agitation will continue and now raising  more demands to be met and want the laws to be passed in parliament  before they withdraw which means that they do not respect or believe  in the PM's statement . This is not all looking good .
I remember when shekhar uncle talked about the impenetrable fort modi and how history taught us that popular leaders has been defeated no one but themselves in Indian politics.
Madam didn't explicitly mentioned the interest rate which is paid when credit taken by farmer in distress from arhatiyas..
Repeal 3 Bill and make sure law of the MSP
"you have to subsidize farmers somehow. usa do it, japan do it, eu do it, china do it. orelse the whole society will suffer."
I support  farmers & stand with protest and against government policies
Modi does not care about the sikh farmers Punjabi farmers. Its the truth
This is when godi media shows you false image of farmer protest SOLD MEDIA BJP IT CELL 
You must know that it is illegal to sell crops other than mandi (where agents take 5% commision and taxes are also there) that means farmer doesn't has right to sell his own crop where he wants and at which price he wants.
Mahatma Ji....Kindly be the guest of the farmers at any of the protest sites
Plz support this momvent !!! We need this spirit in every Indian!
"I think 'they' know that it's better allowing farmers their wish on 26th Jan,  than having a face off with them !!"
"6. Most of the people were clueless in the protest, jinhone farm bill padhna to dur, inka mtlb bhi nhi pta tha, aur baithe the tents me.."
"Khalistan The Punjsb Annexe report from the British government has been sent to UN and from UK supreme court by SFJ and nothing can stop the dream of having our own land back. India had its opportunity for 70 years to work with Sikhs and respect our freedom and beliefs but instead, we were treated like guardians of Hindustan Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji was disrespected time after time after time and one generation of Sikhs inPunjab were murdered by the indian state, For decades our people have lived under threaten by the Indian central government. If they thing Farmers will clear the decks of Delhi then they are even dumber than the previous guardians of indian government. Modi will be hung and his entire chain of command coming as far as CABAL and Billionaires will all be extinct withing the next 12 months just like Mughal empire and general Odwer."
"Whatever people say (yeay I do agree Hindustan me sare steps Election oriented hi the)  yet a great step by Government Of India, it was getting more sensitive issue. Thanx to PM of India"
"Guptaji, also highlight the fact that, the tax-paying citizen pays MSP twice. Once, in tax and again as part of MRP. So, if MSP is made law, mandi must be abolished to save the tax part being wasted. Everyone worrying about farmers. What about taxpayer?"
"how does one distinguish these farmers being genuinely mistreated, or just another special interest group barring other potential competitors?"
"Guys, if these farmer bill are sooooo bad, why are only 2 states involved in this, why not the other millions of farmers in India?"
2) Before this ordinance also any farmer can sell his crop to any state. There ia no restrictions. Many of Haryana farmers sell their wheat in Narela Mandi....
Even Australia Had similar reforms and protets and India too ncie India great Way ahead. They are stopping stubborn burning Majority of farmers want those laws only farms from Punjab and haryana are doing because they are richer than otehr south indian farmers which makes them earn a bit less or make less profit ratehr than good Income than now.
"If this laws had come during congress period, Modi supporters would have been protesting instead of farmers"
Now the day will come when small farmers will cry and learn a lesson 
This guy is so far removed from the farmers concerns - in my opinion (humble) he is another voice for the government.
these  farmers didn't see the virus but saw the harmless from the centre govt.
Don't worry .. this is a strategy to find out people in nvilved in Khalistan from inside India. Now they are tracked . Try to understand the depth
Excellent and balanced analysis of current issue of farm bills.   Govr is in fix.  Let's see what is the ultimate results.
"One day, only we, the buyers will suffer the most. If the mandis are scrapped off in such a technical way, then the local street vegetable markets would vanish and we would be forced to buy only from malls, paying huge prices."
By chance Modi Ji has done right thing. Hope they do not bend to these blackmailing people sitting around Delhi.
GODI MIDIA KO BATADO TICKET SAHAB BJP JEET RAHI HAE YA NAHI
Sir...you didn't consider Bihar farmers are selling their lands and going to punjab haryana and doing  labor farming.
What a shameful act by BJP on peaceful citizens. It's unforgivable. British hanged estimated 1200 Indians before granting independence. Over 600 farmers already dead and one more died off injuries yesterday. BJP wants more.
Farm bills are great. Labour laws are welcoming. 
Three idiots finish our country (1) Andh Bhakt (2) Modi (3) Yogi finish our peace 
Boooohot der kar di ....janaab ...aate aate ..! Hundreds (7!?)  of farmers have lost their lives in the agitation ..!
The best videos on farm bill is made by print. Thank you Shekar Gupta.
"She had explained the things well but finally end up in a erroneous conclusion. Definitely there are lots of issues with current APMC systems. Bt the new acts are going to worsen the situation further. Now onwards the farmers needs to bargain with more powerful purchasers than earlier small traders. The small/medium farmers wouldn't have any bargaining power with big corporates. If the intention was to make MSP mandatory in every private transaction,  why did the bills not contain a clause that the price paid to the farmer by the purchaser shall not be less than the notified MSP?. That's why lakhs of farmers are on the streets. "
"Simply ...why govt introduce such laws which are against farmers,tell us "
Farzi Kisaan neta  has been exposed badly now He is hiding behind farmers to save himself bolo ola hu uber
"over the price prevailing immediately preceding twelve months, or average retail"
How can a common people from other states can help farmers pls tell sir  thinking write a letter to PM if we all ryt atleast they can hear
"They introduce bills in favour of Industrialists like Adani (against whom already a lot of opposition is there in Rajasthan, due to mines controversy and Australia also) and effect poor farmers. But we dont speak as it doesnt effect us."
. Canada needs to stand up to and voice support for the indian farmers
Very nice analysis of anti national Rakesh Tikait. Thank you. Congratulations.
Farmer-Mandi-Corporate
Zee news always know his duty ......zee news depend on bjp vice versa I
Farmers are our country bone so 
But you didn't say what happens to the farmers if the farm laws are adopted.
"If the laws are repelled then i want millions of hindus on the streets, blocking roads etc etc demanding a hindu rashtra.... Seeing that is how we want to govern the nation....."
But we need to educate the farmers with this laws.
"MSP procurement happens in 23 States for paddy and 12 States for Wheat and It is the ignorance of Tikait and his paid leaders. In other commodities marketable surplus is not there. SKM is not demanding inclusion of Maize. (in Bihar & MP), Jowar (MH), Bajra (Rajasthan), Mandua (Uttrakahand) in PDS system bcoz it will affect the procurement of wheat and paddy in Haryana and Punjab."
Thanks for courageously supporting farmers. 
Forget about losing the battle!! Modi and Shah haven't even begun to play their game. And I'm saying this when I'm a congress supporter. I know what they can do!!
"My take on this.. When Amazon & Flipkarts came in,, we thought they would monopolize.. But see now.. You have Jiomart, tata cliq, nykaa, and many more may come.. So if we apply the same to Farming,, we can also expect many to come up, and would have eventually benefitted all.  Once we have a working model, then many would start it and would benefit both farmers, and corporates..."
these laws had the potential to release the farmers from the cluthes of the licensed middlemen and empower them various platforms provind them great value... Alas ..lost it all.
I don't get it I have read all the clause of the bill it helps the farmer but why all this protest ?? Plz help me to understand by not calling me a bhakt  iam a neutral person 
"Sir I am from West Bengal ,, Every year farmers have suffered in potato selling to the market ,winter is the appropriate season for potato cultivation .Every year farmers protested to buy their products and suffering a heavy loss to sell in not appropriate price .But in that time of year in  August-september - October months , the price of potato is going to much more high 5 times,6 times more the farmer selling price .we are trouble in every year in those times .And potato is very highly demanded vegetables in west Bengal in Durga Puja festival and all time in the year .sir plzzz if you read this comment ,,plzz make a vedio about it ....Thank you sir .Jai Hind ."
"Salute Lallantop for showing Truth, No Farmer No Food "
I support kishan... Lekin jo so called kishan ne kia usko support nehi karta. It is unfortunate to see 26 jan event by the aggressive jali kishan the are not actual bharat ki kishan.
This is not a farmer protest anymore. It's Khalistani movement backed by Pakistan. Now state machinery should be applied with full force.
This is not only the issue of farmers but to all those who eat
You discussed only the flaws of APMC Mandis and not the advantages. 
Waoooooooo. little farmer Hero. Mind blowing...JAI jagannath swami bless you.
What an attitude  when he says  ban Karo Taliban KO  he knows that India will never ban Taliban 
Farmer are doing right 
Produce of a farmer is eaten by people of all religion
"1984 se  aur ek bar ""jay javan jai kisan"". Politicians ayega jayega bolega  .Always salute  to soldiers and farmers real hero."
Dekho police walo ko bacha rahe the kisan or police wale kese mar rahe the kisaano ko
Is media trying to support farmers ....rather then highligting on violence which is wrong
b)  Required money and material input should be provided to farmer if desired by farmer. 
There is no difference between Modi govt and talibans
"Correction the APMC in different states is regulated by the respective SARKAR of that PARTICULAR states. One of the major concerns of the farmers was the fear of losing land to the BIG GIANTS which was not discussed in the video, which in turn is just fear with no grounds since THE CONTRACT FARMING AS TOLD IN THE BILLS AND IN THIS VIDEO will ONLY be done ON THE PRODUCE and IT MUST NOT INCLUDE BINDING OF ANY KIND on THE LAND of the farmer. I completely agree that these reforms seem to be a bit Theoretical-Revolution, but the need of the hour is to plug the loopholes which are giving the farmers GENUINE concerns not FORCE the COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL OF THESE BILLS. I would not like to talk about HOW THE BILLS were passed tho."
Dada ji makes me cry    how can Someone called  them terrorist .     Even some of my relatives called them   terrorist.   Rip those barave farmers  
Grt video and grt enthusiasm in farmers as well as samdish . I hope they make this arogant govt. take back these laws!
We stand with farmers 
If they are real farmers beating is wrong.
"City people if do not know about farmer situation then please do put hate comment just watch it,it's better not comment on any topic base on half information.its almost two month they are on protest in winter it's show these three kanoon are against Farmer and government should roll back it.This comment are not for troller RSS and BJP people"
"Kisan zindaabad. Real power of india kisan still keeping peaceful protest, but BJP must keep it in mind that if kisan came to fight than this govt can't survive for one week. Love kisan love NDTV. Because you are the only main stream channel who is presenting the real jounalism and bearing hardship by govt. I also respect and support Ravish bhai. Love from Pakistan"
"But the government  is not ending the MSP system. The opposition is lying  to the media ,thus creating a sense of fear among the farmers. Btw  loved your video , finally  I can understand  the whole  thing  ."
At the end it is farmers loss the protest were like that scenario where  Fruit vendor is selling a fruit for Rs 5 and the consumer is demanding Rs 10.
"Such a shame, Because of few farmers the whole farmer community in india have lost their respect. "
"the journalist is kinda nervous about ""the violance"". did she ever stopped to consider that dispossessing farmers to the benefit of corporations involves violence?"
This is politics by all political parties. In the interest of the Nation Mr Modi has taken back the Agricultural Bill passed by the parliament.
Half of the military soldiers hail from farmer backgrounds
First Time I Had Seen Police Is Pelting Farmers With Stones 
Who said that they are not farmers  u can't hire 3 lakh people with one lakh tractor so use your common sense and come out of this modi bhakhti
"Ok listen bro, let me show you a mirror. Reliance is coming down in retail business and at the same time farm bill has passed? Reliance will need raw material, where will it come from, farms right? How will they get material at lower lost by the farm law, isn't it? For eg. ITC they almost have everything, to make cigg they have tobacco and that's what reliance wants to do but at lower cost and hence FARM BILL."
An excellent analysis and commentary by Shekhar ji. It makes this farmers issue so simple to understand.
Proud to be a Indian......thanks to our PM modi to take brave decision 
Je baat... Ye hai real farmer..
Best ever video to explain farmers agitation
Farmer's demand is totally correct.
"My father is a farmer , I am from a farmer's family...I know the real struggle . But also I proud for it."
3rd Bill is very Dengerous for every Indian..
This is the best explanation I've come across for farm bills. Damn 
Thanks for farmers news
So sooooooooooo proud of our Farmers.
So sad....  Justice for farmers
"Long live Farmers, Long live their Patriotism. Long live Sikhism. Long live their fighting Spirit."
Please make a video on why farmers are not getting promised MSP. As you said only 6% farmers get the promised MSP. Pls make a video addressing this issue.
Who is responsible for deaths of 700 farmers????
she was never giva up...she was indian second iron lady  we are supported you mam.
"for those asking why only 2 rich state farmers are protesting..because they have the means.. Because victims lose their voice after a point. they become moot ..it doesnt mean they agree. i beat you, and you are silent, doesnt mean you are not gettig hurt..and if another person whom i beat screams, doesnt mean he is getting hit harder. understand the scenario. poor dont have tools to speak up."
if farmers dont want to improve their situatio n just because of cheap politics then no one can do anything
After this don't expect any kind of development for farmers. 
"expression of thoughts in our country are motivated by religious sentiments and hatred or likeness towards each others religions , people lack knowledge yet they express their thoughts infront of the camera, we have elected BJP because most of us hate muslim community and now we have elected whom we wanted so we got to respect their decision, either choose hatred or development"
Amrinder offertunist jai kissan farmers never forget atrocities muted on farmers abuses forcing loose police goons etc dont forget bros
""" I did what was needed for farmers, now I am doing what is needed for the nation"" "
Poor farmers will be exploited by rich farmers. Good for them. I am going to stop buying food grains grown in Punjab.
"Not done for the love of farmer, but rather with UP elections in mind. Sad so many farmers had to pay with their lives."
Nuksan BJP ka nahee...gareeb kisano ka hua hai....desh ka hua hai...tax payer ka hua hai. Benefit of repeal is only for congress and communists and leftists.
Salute PM Justin Trodoue   we love you for your support to farmers and world peace and Human rights   
LOL to the killer of 700 farmers....
This bill has removed that obstacle in front of the farmers and allowed them to do business with companies or the customers directly due to the contract based farming.
Yogiji should start ethanol production in large scale in up let them protest jab ghar ayenge to baki farmers ko malamal payenge
29:00 at this point they showed how loving and caring they are. It is giving me tears that they are facing so much no main stream media is showing this proud of you unscripted. First i was not supporting this protest because of tv news but now these videos has open my eyes and now i feel sorry for not supporting them earlier.
Help the farmers...
"Police must join with farmers, your brothers."
"The thing is the market system which was present before was not capable enough to do proper justice to farmers, as you guys have stated too. Even the present opposition has also mentioned that farming laws in India needs changes in a way that it gives more benefits to the farmers. "
Save farmers please show latest news of farmers   #SikhGenocide  is happening   bjp goons are killing farmers save farmers save future
Thats not a khalistan flag. . The people have sent a message that the  red fort and india belongs to the people of I didn't and farmers and not modi and ambani and they're big egos
"The laws were for farmers benefits however the protest was high jacked by outside countries who wanted to bring instability in India once revoked there plan to create instability failed, Narendra Modi is the best, intelligent and beloved prime minister of our country, he knows nation matters mostJai Hind.."
Indian Farmers we stand by you..keep it up lots respect
A simple solution to solve the problem for grain storage would be that farmers can form their own regional cooperative like amul. It will reduce the financial burden on the government and at the same time empower the farmer. The concept of MSP on all crops is not feasible. It will increase the fiscal burden on the government.
1) MSP (minimum support price) is guaranteed so there is nothing that farmers will get less that the minimum price
Even US farmers is suffering because of few corporation controlling the entire farming industry.
Already farmers can sell their produce to anyone they want instead of going to mandi. What this bill does is just making sure the buyers are protected from future litigation and remove the stocking limitation of the buyers which will impact the both the end buyers and farmers.
Please let everyone know the reality   we support farmers
"Farming has high climatic risk... hence investment should be through farmer's partnership with government , non farming citizens and financial institutions...loss should be born by Government and Profit should be distributed among all"
"who says we dont have leaders ? Mr. Rakesh Tikait is one such leader, better than those presently in Government"
"As mentioned by govt, that farmer can still follow old rules only. They have not been abolished. They still exist and can be chosen by farmers if they want"
Most of the farmers in all other states did not have a problem. 
Rakesh tikait is ghereat leader
I believe govt is responsible not solving the issue making them to wait from along time same time we should respect our law and order please do peaceful rally don't harm police or anything and I my humble request  to govt to resolve this  issue and talk to farmers and slove even there family members are waiting from a long time
"Waiting to see how this plays out, full support for farm reforms and PM Modi"
"Tell only about the kishan bill, do not explain what is saying the kishan or opposition leaders."
Support farmers. Boycott reliance jio and other ambani adani products
"Farm law was passed without discussion and repealed without discussion,what is the used of Members of Parliament?.why not let Modi alone sit."
"Finally  brokers, Khalistan terrorists and its supporters congress, communist and peaceful community won their violence game. "
My family were farmers back in their home country. So my love for farmers go through my respect for them and that my blood family was also farmers. 
I am from Pakistan. but I am with these sikh farmers.
How  can other countries allow the Indian farmers to hold rallies in their countries knowing fully well that Mr. Modi has repealed the acts?
3:13 this is the bjp government versus farmers ..
""" Iman, Taqwa, Jihad Fi Sabililah"" is the motto of Momins of India. % proved. Justice for Kashmir Hindu Genocide.."
"11:36 Rp Singh ji, I challenge you please visit any village of Patiala district and see yourself what farmers want here "
Finally Punjab and Haryana wins
They are not a farmer
2. If any dispute allow us to go to court currently in these laws it's written whatever dispute if arises only farmers can go to SDM. 
"Well Mr. Shekhar, you conveniently missed out the legal implications to farmers incase these corporates takes loans against the farm lands and what happens if the corporates don't pay the amount as promised or reduce the rates."
Thank you for such a sensible explanation at a time when the political parties and the farmers of certain states are not willing to understand the real part of the bills!
"Waah good from now on in india commit any crime say that you are farmer, they wont arrest you even though if they arrest contact tikait offer him a good amount he will come with his protest gang and will make you get released without even going to court,from now i guess this trend will continue and even rakesh tikait will. Make it as a business as he is earning good amount"
God help  the Indian farmer  may God victory  to farmer
"If he has been so closely associated with farmerss issues, why was the silence during farmers protests?"
Communist flags eh? Farmers you say eh? Do they know how Communists treated the Ukranian farmers? Or the Chinese theirs?
I come from an India where NewsLaundry is an independent media
"Bill wapis lo then all will be ok . Kisaan will happy. Its all about govt ego and Modi dictatorship . You guys are helping his Dictatorship policy. All normal people will have to pay for that INDIA is going to be China. If we didnt stop , Country is going in some rich powerful hands ."
"Well done to the farmers, the government should represent the people from the land and not pressures from outside or within (businesses) its money to them but its your home and thats not preplacable!"

Historic victory for farmers and our Democracy 
Though i like all of your videos but this time i am not convinced  as i myself am a  farmer from Uttarakhand . You have vast  knowledge of academics but i suggest you following...
Both farmers and police suffering due to modi govt
Rakesh Dacoit and his goons need to be taught a lesson
Please make a video on pros and cons of farmer bill.
"Hence, these must be repealed, the government agreed to amend 90% of the bill which means that they are wrong so why are they enforced?"
I am with bill. Ye government kuch to ker rahi hai farmers ke liye
"Another example is Milk which is an 8 Lakh Crore produce in India more than Wheat, potato, onion, rice and pulses put together in India, why because anyone can buy it, whoever wants to buy it can buy directly and not through an APMC, the similar thing is getting implemented in Agriculture"
We are with farmers 
2020 to till how many farmers kill in this duration nov .2021 .
What ..B.J.P.. has to do with.this ..Farmers protest ..
Shekhar sir could plz plz plz make a Hindi version of this episode so I can at least convince my father and my fellow farmers that these bills are for our good.
Sandip Chaudhary and Ravish Kumar real truth hero of India Bharat Journalist
It would have been better if you had done little more research on farm bills and had explained government's point of view too.
Run it over anti farmer fellows.
Govt. ignored  when hundreds of farmers lost their lives but when elections approach they  kick started election propaganda by this step
These kind of violence is not acceptable. I believe real farmers will not do these things. They definitely respect Indian flag than other. Definitely these are not real farmers
"After Lok sabha election speech till now when was he talk about Unemployment , Economic growth and development. Only Hindi and Muslim main Topic and media too"
Still some andhbhakt believe that modi and other care for farmer
My dear meghnad only 6% farmers in nation get benefits of msp. All others get lesser price than msp. I always support your initiative in news media but you have less info on farming just like any other city guy...
India Mai 29 states hai andolan sirf Congress bale state Mai hi ho Raha hai
"The people who think that farmers get freebies from the government should try shaking hands with them, they are rough and tough from the toil ! It is physically challenging work, in the hot Sun, far more challenging than the most intensive HIIT exercise programs in air conditioned gyms! There is no relief mentally either. They risk their lives, one of my relatives died due to snake bite while she was working in the farm. Farms are away from the village and the city, even medical aid is not available at hand easily . So it is risky business I am disappointed by the way general public dont care and neither does the government ! Today no farmer wants his son or son-in-law to be a farmer ! Young boys who are farmers dont get brides! The farmers only want a better life for their children. For their future is dark This is just sad !"
Where can u see farmers pelting stones?????
"If companies try to exploit farmers or use legal power, farmers still have choice of mandi or wherever they want to sell."
We support farmers  modi is wrong about the bills as its unethical
"ZBNF farming is the way forward. Govt schemes  though well intentioned will be squandered by  systemic bureaucracy. Selling at MSP ,MIS is a result of  not adopting  marketing , value add  or  forecasting methods by the farmer."
Election results me dikhega farmer power.
Air India sale: Modi govt's first privatisation in 7 years; what...
"Govt. need to have a seperate agency to act as a business resource center for the farmers in each state that they can go to; to give them business guidance, teach them business & negotiating skills etc.  "
I wish Indian media was stating facts like Vox instead of the being the hypocritic bought out companies they are.
Thank you to my brothers and sisters who participated in this awareness rally in New Delhi. Your support means a lot. Keep spreading the awareness and continue to awaken our brothers and sisters who are still asleep. The government is determined to suppressing the voice of the people and Citizens of India are determined to have their voice heard.   Insaniat Zindabad! 
Why don't people are understanding  that this law is not only  sikh or Punjab specific  but is for whole  nation 
India mai shikho per zulm ho raha hai.... only one solution free khalistan.
"We BJP supporters must realize that this was more of a national/internal security issue than political. Although this move is bad for the nation's progress, lets just back modi for now."
Why don't you do DNA of BJP or Modi
Great farmers protest!! Let their concerns be addressed without further delay!!
Election is coming  ye toh hona hi tha they are losing but sad so many farmers died coz of him. Farmers should wait before doing anything because we can't trust feku on this.
Germany's farmers are protesting in there country against of new law . You can search in Google. Euronews is showing that.
"The BJP is working to sell, lease, auction and handover public infrastructure to private and corporate supply chain. Like sarkari schools, the dark laws will destroy farming as it has done to education, healthcare and employment dedicated to the poor !"
Pm Narendra Modi has been  repealed three farmer's law on the occasion of Guru Nanak jayanti.
Farmer protest is still continue even after 5months of this video 
I think bjp should remember india is mainly an agricultural country. Agriculture accounys for approximately 33% of India GDP and employs nearly 62% of the population. Ek aisa wqt tha k hum Hindustani bhukmari k shikar the an green revolution k baad aur kisaano ki mehnat k baad aisa wqt aya hai k india exports surplus rice and other harvest to other countries
All the Indians here loving Taliban. 
More than 700 farmers died many suffered in protests.
"What a shameful people still exist after that brutal massacre in karnal, nobody want to get beaten unnecessarily if we r protesting something is wrong plz support farmers, even I m not a farmer but know all the problems faced by them. This incident will remain forever in the history and the upcoming generations will shock to know that nobody support farmer. Shame of u all who are saying farmers are criminals, if only Punjabis were not involved in the freedom struggle then all the people who are against farmers works as the servants in British ers home. Sorry if i hurts someone's feeling. #KISANANDOLAN #KISANMAJDOOREKTAZINDABAAD"
Spineless modi  now this will boost confidence of anti national elements. Farmer lost dakait won Enjoy democracy 
These are not farmers n allotted route is different
We should respect farmers and especially from punjab haryana as they contribute a lot to our economy and also the sikh people are right in the demands. If modiji want to make india like Venezuela then we all cannot let that happen. We need to stand for farmers and we will fight till the end to ensure government withdraws this new rule.
Taliban is nothing infront of Indian army
Now there should be a new protest by real farmers :D
"Central government should think about farmers(kissan), not about Mukesh ambani or adani(business class)."
When the ruling party breaks the rules of the house why should they be trusted by farmers with the new bill ?
"""This is an attempt to make, by far the most unbiased and simplest video on the farm bills on the internet"""
God Yet the farmers will still loose for a fair price who  will be left in the hands of middlemen hoarders and corrupt politicians who will control the price. The rest of the farmers of India were so happy that they got a better price for their crops and accepted the agricultural laws. Leaving only Punjab farmers under pressure from middlemen and foreign funds to protest who were not even paying tax and controlled the price. Shame
No farmer no food 
Its a test of time for these 3 bills whether it will wrong the opposition or it will turn out to be another type of demonetisation. I really wish these reforms overcome all myths and help farmers.
I'm from Pakistan... And surprised India still have such people.. Very non bised analysis.
One year of convincing farmers was nor enuf? Press were friendly
Bakts :- Farmers are anti-national while eating dinner and wating BND 
Tikait and duplicate farmer's are responsible of  farmers death' jai Hind
"After all this time, the three laws have to be repealed because of the contribution of the farmers.  Bjp fall began..."
"Why did you not highlight the fact  mentioned by NC Saxena at 7:46 ?  He clearly mentioned that not just the government is buying wheat at almost twice the price from the farmers its has not increased the price of selling to the poor. Please don't mislead nave people. Be unbiased in your analysis. There is no difference between you and that chaudhary guy from Znews, just that you are on the opposite sides. Bharat mata ki jai."
Huge respect to these farmers protesting...
These actions make some people still doubt farmers intentions.
If the farm laws are bad why did they framed why it is in manufesto of cong bjp aap
They aren't farmers
"Punjabis protested,  they are called Khalistanis."
Do you think the government is so dumb to anger the farmers? 
Hello Guys I am a farmer from Punjab IAM telling u all that I agree some farmers became emotional and went to the red fort but BJP took  an advantage of all this and disguised there men within us . It was a very clever move of there but what good had happened. Even though it's a protest farmers have opened health camps and serving free food . Police officers have there hands tied so we cannot say a word to our cops. Nothing good has happened to either farmers nor police just BJP took benefit of it. RIP to all the people who died in farmers protest.
I stand with farmer
Wow only a handful women protesting and so much media coverage and here in india over 2 million farmers protesting and no media coverage 
I am with farmers 
Even our media is fucked up. Putting pressure on farmers by making nonsense Alligaitons
"I always supported ""farmers"" and I will support "" farmers""..that's it.."
We support farmers
RG who's party has lost 2 elections under his leadership is the one getting blamed to encourage the farmers and protest  if he was this much capable then he wouldn't have lost.
"Sir apse kattai sahmat nhi,,how can u say that all farmers were against of it...."
i am with farmers 
"If farmers are so called ""KHALISTANI"" ...that means we are being feed by khalistanis"
"Actual headline for this video should be "" FARMERS ATTACKED FOR PROTESTING BY POLICE AND GOVT"""
"On a longterm view this bill will clearly create a scenario resembling USA where most of farmland and farming is done by big companies and most of people have looking for jobs in cities, where many are living as homeless."
This is the death of democracy. How can you pass a bill without discussion. Every members want to repeal this bill(last being bjp) but what's the point in debating after the bill is being passed? Speaker should have allowed debate first may be for an hour or two then called for voting and repealed it. That could have been simple.
Do u know al economist and expert supported farm law.
So many election during this law.Bjp won all this election.
A hisak nahi hai kisi police ki Jaan nahi gayi it's fair iam with farmers
Long live the Farmers 
From this video I dont find any violent protest. Though I have no full coverage or information of this protest. However from what I see on the video it shows that peaceful protesters been stopped by police and when not stopped they have beaten up brutally.. If this is the case then I condemn the action.. If the situation was different than what it show then I would not comment... But one thing what I understand is that conducting peaceful protest is our right and no one in this country can stop us from doing that.. N one more point I want to highlight that if tomorrow farmers stop farming and stop production then humko ghar pe sab ugake khana padega.. This is a message for andhbhakts.. Think before blindly supporting some one or and ideology..
from seller and buyer each 8.5% . These new 2020 farm laws allows farmers to sell 
I proud to be our farmers and ravish Kumar sir
Supporting farmers is common sense (Not common in politicians) All developed countries pay fat farmer subsidies and high support prices to keep farmers growing grains. Support to farmers from the USA.
Farmers across india ?
"Govt of India give 3 lakh crore subsidy to agriculture sector annually which includes from fertilizer to MSP, however mostly consumed by big farmers from Punjab, haryana and west UP, we have disguised unemployment in agriculture, our productivity yield is low, APMC is monopolized... Only privatisation can save this..... It contains huge potential, informal jobs will convert into formal, farmers will get their deserving share."
"Even this is not a coincidence that when everyone was coming to delhi first day he came delhi around 5am he was not stopped by police from delhi and Haryana dont know why.  Then He came to india gate, seesh ganj sahib Gurudwara and he was posting everything on social media while police was arresting others who were caming to delhi before and after him. "
 2) BJP Goons (like deep sidhu and they are many in No.) Were allowed by police and Supported by police in reaching Red Fort and Defame the Farmers as well as Sikh community
Farmers.. Protest.. 
The reason farmers did not go to supreme Court is because they knew supreme Court will favor government. 
i think india is again back with its indian fragnance which gives indians a special bondage..the same bondage which kept indians united since its birth...defying all odds of diversity..we are one ..this is real hinduism..long live my country long live my countryman
Please explain? I am humbly asking? I learnt that punjab cm passed an ordinance against these very new farm laws which means that these new farm laws will not be applicable in the state if Punjab. If not applicable in punjab then why the fear is there?
It's about farmers please make video in farmer's language. Don't be like govt.who give English advertisement . @Newslaundry
Love for farmers from Kerala
"Govt must stop giving free amount to farmers. Crores of rupees wasted by all government for appeasement politics. Govt must use MANREGA, FARMER subsidy for creating agricultural activity on WASTE, BARREN LAND under Govt. In India large lands are unable to use for farming- due to Natural calamities. Rain water wastage must be stopped. This land must be used for agri activity by using MANREGA & Kissan subsidy. Both these expenses are used by govt for cover up their economic manipulation. STOP tax payers money wasting. FREE FREE FREE ENOUGH. Every where free money is distributing. What is going on??   "
If govt really want farmer to grow and not suicide then govt should pass and apply MSP law across India.
"Repealing farm laws is against development, but without change how will govt double the income of farmers upto 2022."
"Good Law . Bad Deployment ! Sad. Shows slamming laws down someones throat doesnt make it real. Consensus building through democratic means involving all relevant stake holders while can be slow and painful is the right strategy for India. People clamoring for muscling up strategy on any issue over consensus building approach should know India is too fragmented and diverse in its view points to be strong armed into one. This would have been the best time for Bjp to use its cadre to do drives related to benefits of these laws rather than employing rhetoric. Nevertheless the last part of what PM said gives me hope. All party committe while could set us back by sometime, should atleast get us some part of these laws back if not all. To the nay sayers of these laws , i want to say one thing. Market economics is the only reason why this country has developed in the last 30 years. To move against that would mean agriculture would continue to slip as a percentage of gdp.  We dont want to be a food importing nation again. Lets be 'together'and do what it takes to revive this sector."
"the govt can launch a scheme where farmers get a fair price for their land. This will also be useful in bailing out farmers. Then, the govt gives the farmer a fixed salary for producing crops. This way, farmers are ensured  a fixed income even if the harvest is not good giving them financial security. The govt gets all these crops and then sells these to the traders at the govt price. This way the govt can control market prices .Both the farmer and the consumer benefit from this."
"These farmers cannot afford to drag massive corporations to court when they significant underpay them. The entire agricultural industry of India cannot be dictated by 2 or 3 laws alone. Each subsector agriculture has a different process of producing, selling and managing the crops. The ignorant media are misconstruing the real intent and purpose of these farmers."
They are not farmer
Every Indians know what Modi motif are..
Now farmers of India  will be able contribute % in GDP
Modi u will pay for dis poor farmer so sad fr dem
Rakesh Dacoit and his peaceful protest
Why dont you show the goons who have reached the singhu border to attack the farmers? Has your channel also joined the godi media club? Why dont you show the videos of the cops disrespecting the tricolour on 26th January?
"After 9-10 months of the protest being started, I listened to several people on internet and this is by far the most amazing explaination to Farm bills I ever listened/watched. Also I came across this channel a week ago and I must admit the content here is superb. More power to you!"
"And general Dyer shot at people lathi charge is something usual ,happened a million times in Congress times too plus Congress can't talk about brutality if they didn't forget period of emergency under Indra Gandhi , operation blue star or the shooting of farmers at a protest in 1998"
"6. In Contract , private purchaser can amend price depending upon quality of produce.  Private purchaser is togive seeds, fertilisers , then in case yield is not as of excellent quality why right has given to Corporate to amend price?? Why farmer has to bear loss? "
The demands of the farmers are very reasonable. The government should accede to their demands without further delay.
Up and Punjab election is coming hahaha dont fool Indian and farmers
u did not discuss with farmer.farmer dnt want so take it back .why too much talking..
Please post more videos on farmer's protest mainstream media is ignoring such a big protest .
"You're misguiding the peoples of India! The demanded MSP means, the minimum price guarantee of the crops! It doesn't mean Government should buy the whole crops, the GOVERNMENT Or private whoever is buying should buy in MSP."
Farmers have right to sell their crops wherever they want... That's freedom.... Also n advise to VOX y don't u compare the farming policy with America's n Europe's policy.....
Eyewash for farmers ... Government thinks that people are stupid coz MSP is not gonna stay then why announcement been done now? How low can this government stoop down.
Why the Indian police force use water cannon and tear gas on peaceful protests? The farmers dont have weapons...This is so brutal...
"How come the committee MISSED HUMANITY ASPECT Poorest of the Poorest Farmer...The Apex court must dwell into this ,Normally HON PM MODI JI decision for the FAUZI and  Farmers is Spot on, let us wait for further update..Jai Hind  Jai Sri Ram"
Gote Bala haba only punjab election come
Farmer is correct . ..
Sir you are the voice of millions of poor farmers. Thanks a lot.
Same thing applicable in Indian Media also.
"2. Also, farmers get farm subsidies for electricity, water, fertilisers, and even seeds.   With the Mandi collapsing, the state Tax revenue is gone. This means no subsidies.  That will cause a havoc.  Btw, Agro subsidies are a big part of the west.  It has 2 effects -1. It skews markets beyond recognition in favor of lobbyists like corn etc.  2.  It is a must have since farmers cant survive without it.  The result is, it has NOT helped the farmer survive.  Its not the Free market. And, the effect on environment is beyond repair.  Indian subsidies on the other hand are way more effective since it helps out a v poor farmer and are free of lobby pressures at least when compared to the west.  We need to solve the Indian problem here not the western. "
Thank you for raising the farmers issue.
"I know I'm not that old to talk politics nd all but bhaiya I don't know why I become so depressed whenever I start thinking about our country's  condition. They are literally torturing farmers, censoring social media, asking companies for our personal data, controlling news media and god knows what else. I love my country so much, but yesterday when I was at my uncle's"
"Rakesh Tikait has more experience than many........., well done ! Rakesh keep it up."
"Govt should declare  its targeted purchases of food grains under Food Security Law -wheat, rice, dal etc. at the least 1 year before and announce schedule of quantity and quality of its purchases from different states and mandis along with the start and end dates. MSP is declared before the sowing starts. It should spread its procurement widely and not concentrate only on Punjab, Haryana and UP. It should not purchase food grains beyond minimum buffer stock requirements. This will remove undue benefits farmers from these 3 states are getting. But Central Govt should also remove all subsidies it gives and distribute the amount saved as DBT to all the farmers in the country along with a minimum income support to all farmers and landless workers. This will free farmers to decide what and when and how much to produce and will change the conditions for better."
Jo 800 per quintals wheat buy kar rhe hai wo systematic exploiters hai aur inn law k baad farmers ko government aur exploiters ke alwa 3 rd option mil rha hai.   After seeing this video I accept education does not matter in politics because most educated CM is also trying cheap tricks.
Solidarity with the farmers 
Hindu and Sikhs jat won but farmers lost
We stand with modi ji u r n true inspiration for all of us....mera Bharat mahan 
Most Anti Poor and Anti Farmer Prime Minister India ever Had and Would never have.
well government must ensure the corruption free farmers system..and  looking at the current agriculture situation.....all three laws are indeed necessary to bring revolution in farming and make farmers well connected to the business world so that they can increase their income ....but all i can see these so called farmers agitation is in reality are  political moves ..or we can say its anti modi agitation nothing else..
Love you Dhruv Rathee bhai for bringing up truth regarding Farmers in front of whole India....May god bless you.
Even if you say Modi has Ego....Ex- Congress leader Manmohan agreed that MODIJI is the greatest leader...
Can you translate it into hindi so that we can share it with actual farmers?
You have done a great job of providing a true image of this movement by bringing history of farmers and highlighting the government's authoritarian agenda overall...
"Sir you are totally wrong. Do you think you are better then Modiji,? No no no, you can give your opinion but not your conclusion "
Mandi system alone panjab government get 5000 crore.....profit......and lakhs of farmer suicide because of it....... farmers have right to do what he want with there producer.....
Good desegion taken by PM & now don't think about farmers live on their own life and PM must think only about country security and there party growing in feature
NDTV - Farmers are hero and victims. - True
All country stands with Rakesh takait ji and against RSS and godi media
Zee news hamesha bjp ka support me in khara h
Respect and Hats Off to DK Sir for this valuable talk !!!! This video should have at least 1 billion views in India  for everyone to know the reality and then make an informed decision and to impel our politicians to act and behave accordingly !!!! Jai Hind !!!!
"The protesting ""farmers"" attacked their car , to get away from them all of this happened. The protesters caught them and killed 3 bjp workers and 1 driver."
bjp will do time pass with RRB NTPC candidates and  farmers like before.. 2022 is going to be a year of protests
I came after PM announced repeal if farm laws. You predicted correctly. I appreciate you shekar ji.

INDIAN  POLICE PLZ SUPPORT FARMER.........MODI MURDABAAD
What if it was not done by farmers and was done just to show that farmers are wrong !?
When the pm is uneducated and farmers are educated
It means an  indirectly government want the large farmers become trader too.
All farmers have gone from delhi to UP suddenly to register their protest as there is poll coming in UP soon 
"Next time when I hear the news about a farmer dying due to lower wages and income from those 3 states I won't be sad , as they chose their own fate ."
"Desh ke opposition parties are not positive, but negative approach...Mirror shows ugly face of opposition and it's negative impact on farmers. Farmers leaders are irresponsible and irreasonable ..Though I express my condolences ..Not a single famer died due to excesses of government but due to natural death. In fact farmer's leaders should compensate from their pockets. 95% farmers are looser.  Money power wins. Sad chapter for farmers."
5 farmers died along with journalistic values.
If bjp looses elections Then the soul of the farmers who died will rest in peace
Farmers are most important people and major sectors(I would say all sectors) are depending on them and if they are in trouble then I would say government are not working properly and all politicians are begging votes before elections and then they are not working for farmers!
"i guess they will leaves their job as protest , to farm laws repeal."
I am don't understanding that the only farmers of haryana and Punjab protesting
"Farmers, no need to talk much.  Since the police whack you, just whack back."
"Dont break your team; all 32 farmers leaders should go  stick together; flock together, in front of modiji. If modiji accepted its fault, then you should take all your belongings and resolve all your problems. Later on nothing will happen as you know modiji like to decide everything by himself. Dictatorship"
Support farmers 
Give her address of you colic journalist who died and other 4 BJP supporters too..there family not weeping..they are celebrating..such shame..
"Thanks for showing our farmers news , bcz our mainstream media totally ignoring farmers struggles"
"Farmers carry seeds and fertilizer . Farmers don't carry Swords, Iron rods, Stones . Only rioters and hooligans carry Swords, "
Government should clear to farmar's about this bill.
RIP Small & poor Farmers
Now who will return those farmers lives whome ur people killed?
If any farmer need to sold his things to private companies direct then we do not need this bill anyone can do this. 
"Ok, here what I got from this episode. To quote: 'it may not help bjp much, but it would damage Congress a lot in Punjab.'  Some times it feels The Print is the gang leader of right wing sanghi crowd."
Keep your spirits high brother farmers.the world is watching and victory soon for you guys. Love and prayers from Malaysia tamilan urban farmer.
Black day for farmers this day will be remembered  where reform lost and hooligans won
All nationalist people's should vote &  support to BJP for national favour 
USA small farmer got distorted. When private companies took over.
There has been no dialogue between farmers and modi. Modi never went to meet the farmers who were run down by his own ministers son. So many farmers gave their life during his protest. Modi's always doing U turns and never fulfilling any promises he made. He is useless and only in his head is he a strong man. China is invading India and Modi can do nothing. He's a coward. This report is wrong! It's not emotional at all. Farmers are wise.
O bhai delhi me kisan bethe hi kaha tha ...sab to khalistani or rapist the....
Ye helicopter wsy bhe Pakistan main he ayega Taliban gift krdega
"Their concerns were 100% valid. Once you remove price guarantees, industrial farms can undercut everyone at a loss in order to drive them out of business before returning to whatever rates they want. That results in less farmers, less choice for consumers, and ultimately higher prices. That's not an ""emotional response"" that's economics 101 - the Walmart model. You only have to look at Australian cattle farming to see this in action."
From defarming that 76% to more manageable percentage. So Modi ji is doing the needful!
Farmers done a great job
Bjp party terirest party in India go back go back modi all state in India go back go back modi
Indian farmers proved India indeed a vibrant democracy. Chinese are jealous 
"Bagat SIngh,....golden temple massacre ......now 700 farmers killed including the run over of car by minister's son. Wait and see....Newton's third law bothered BJP."
I'm a Hindu. I read geeta and also Gurugranth everyday. How can a Sikh wearing kara commit such a horrific murder . Getting bad name to Guru Sahib. I feel i love and follow the teachings of Sikh gurus more than you people. Don't bring down the image of waheguru jis khalsa. You people have to be saviors of the world and not narrow minded Terrorist. Don't think your shastr can be used for protecting dharma in present day world. You people got stuck in time and roam around with outdated weapons. Do some good karmas Singhs with your holly hands. I love and respect all the Sikh gurus for their teachings and sacrifices made to protect Dharma.
"If you are not ready to accept the change, change will change you..It goes for both the government as well as farmers"
The supposed beneficiaries of the bill are fighting it tooth and nail. And the government insist on forcing a bill on farmers which they won't accept at any cost. This government is enemy No.1 of the poor and middle class and farmers of India.
1. 2.5 % of the sale price is the commission for the middlemen. Buys onions for Rs 5 and sells for Rs 80. How is this 2.5% to middleman turned to 7% to farmers ??
More power to these farmers. I hope their voices are heard (actually listened to and acted upon) and that they stay safe and well.
If the market rate is 10 but the rate fixed in contract is 20 then farmers can sell their produce at 20 and the company has to buy it. If the company denies to buy the farmers can file a case against them On the basis of contract as their proof
"Congratulations to my Farmers brothers,"
Thanks to Sir Chhotu Ram who made Mandi act for United Punjab
"farmers launched 'SIM Satyagrah' on Thursday. In a social media campaign, they destroyed Reliance Jio mobile SIM cards in protest against corporates over the contentious farm laws."
Boht ache farmer bhaiyo
#istandwiththepanjabfarmers hope it all works out and gets sorted ASAP!! WJKKWJKF 
"The talk between farmers and government is not crossing The line of ifs , buts , therefore , although , since and ultimately both of us sleep on farm bill using it as pillow for two years , if any solution comes in our dream Will be Okay ! Such is the conclusion of last meeting as laymen can understands ?"
Died Farmers should get compensation
Sikhs were targeted. It was not attack on farmers
This was known. They are not farmers but activists.
"Mr. Prime Minister, we are disipointed on your decission to repeal the farm laws. "
" ""IF THESE ACTS THAT WERE DONE BY FARMERS  ARE NATIONALIST THEN TERRORIST ARE THE TRUE NATIONALIST."""
Very good at least someone who is doing good for the farmers. Jai Bharat Modiji is the best PM.
Sadly  they are doing everything for their own benefit not for our farmers
Why government is testing patience of farmers...
All Govt and states can learn from BJP that you can just bring any bill into parliament and pass it without votes and discussion .... 
Jab Kisan Mare ja rahe  the tab modi ji isliye chup the Kyunki use Samay Chunav nahin tha
Haryana muncipal polls will decide if Farmer laws are designed to benefit BJP or farmers.
One of the biggest problems u missed are about the corporates which ruin the farmers
"Shame on you India, hitting the farmers, who feed you."
"New sympathy propaganda has began, but Modiji is a problem who is true Indian by all means than Taliban"
"Well, i see this as a message to all people who feel opprssed by this fascist regime. Say thanks yo farmers, get inspired from them as say hoorah to Gandhian methods of struggle. "
I support farmers 
Why people treat farmers like they are something above everything they do farming to earn not to feed us for free they are doing business same as everyone doing
"This is not the victory of Punjabi farmers, its a victory of old ways of farming and old ways market. I usually don't agree with India's policy but this was something which would have thrived the Indian economy, Our Villages and the ways of our farmer sell their agricultural produce but this has showed something that farmers don't trust the regulatory bodies and private entities."
"It is a win of ignorance, lack of drive to understand the bill, and lack of empathy for other farmers. But anyway democracy is a popularity contest."
India is a very vast country and half of her population depends on farming. Nearly 500 to 600 millions 
So... reading between the lines ..now that RIL has acquired Future retail group and has consolidated or rather monopolized retail sector now... this Bill's are like a return gift from the sarkar as a token of loyalty.
"However much eye witnesses you bring, I don't think justice will prevail. The case will go on for years and finally the accused will get bail. This is our lovely and great india under siege by modi and amit shah."
You hate modi for bringing farm laws and CAA I hate modi ji because he didn't enforce those laws
Nothing Will Works For Farmers ( Specially Small Farmers)
"Up Election could have started before 1 year back, maximum farmers must alive"

"If people can work in  bars as a government employee, then why can't farmers have a government job. In india government employees are well protected from harsh conditions."
"To give an update on this protest, the government unconditionally repealed all the three new laws. The farmers have declared victory."
"Farmer laws were all good ,,I think government should not taken them back they made a mistake"
We know who owner of ZEE news is  bjp mp himself
Why Farmers had to do this?
Violence and the Disturbance in the Capital on our Republic Day is wrong but The Tiranga was not removed at all and that Sacred flag was put on an Empty pole... Don't make any comment which hearts anybody's religious sentiments because United We Stand (Hindu Muslim Sikh Christian Jain Bodh) the Stronger We Are...
Yes it's against farmer and nation
"Bhai  ,amazing videos,,I watch same one and other every single day .please make more videos on farmer protect..big respect and love to and cameraman parth...."

"Take respect farmers,for your courageous stand to exact your rights, preserve livelihood.Hope the Government listens to your demands as you farmers the only growers defying cold-rain-heat for a country and the world alike to feed on.Without farmers,no choice but to starve."
Very correct I hope everyone understands this.The really farmer is doing farming at home.The one who are protesting are rented gunday.
Why can't the PM go and talk with Farmers and explain this??
Change your headline it's not Indian farmers it's Punjab farmers
"2021 : Farmer's protest in jan feb , may god bless the rest year"
Farmers nahin unhe sirf wheat belt farmers boliye. Woh saare farmers ke representative bhi nahin hain. Asli farmers baaki states ke apne farms par kaam kar rahe hain. In time pass no work waalo ko publicity mat dijiye
Tikait sir you ate really great and you deserve to be a leader of true farmers. I salute you. Jai Jawan Jai Kisan
Farmers are Punjabi and Haryana other states are  only small holdings
Media is behaving as if farmers don't have minds of their own... They are definitely not misleaded
Abhi Sahab your views are true .  But make video on farmers issue and work of government on those.
this is only for Punjab and up elections
Atma manobal of Modi ji is unparalleled in indian history 
"3.If any dispute between farmer and industry then farmer can't go to court, only can go to SDM COURT, Is not this point breaking our fundamental rights because as per constitution  there is an independent judiciary system in INDIA for it's citizen."
Isn't it funny to see Ex CM of Punjab Capt. Amrinder Ji raising the security concerns now? When he was CM what was he doing then? Wasn't  Security of the state  his duty? Why didn't he ensure that Punjab's borders with the enemy nation Pakistan was under proper surveillance with the help of Central agencies? All this dramabazi is to fool the people and score brownie points before the upcoming elections....
They might be farmers But BELONGS to a particular POLITICAL PARTY that also belongs to a CASTE
Why the petrol & diesel price increase several time disfavour of people ? Effect in this regards is feel the people of India.
MSP is not for private players/ buyers( so no question of re-cartelization )  .... It is minimum price  for which Government buys (invariably  at 150 % of input cost ...for selected commodity )  from farmers  please correct yourself sir
Mam please brief me that advantage and disadvantaged of farmers bill ?? Plss
"Except stubble burning demand, i support farmers but you cant support stubble burning. It has crazy effect not only on weather but smog it forms over delhi, up and bihar"

Shame on Indian government #istandwithfarmers
"However... Farmer is already  free to sell crop to private sector , what is the meaning of bills then"
"People who hardly know anything about India, including the farm laws are raising their voices as if its gonna change anything. "
"Bahut bura hua, citizens will At lost. Very big loss to agriculture sector and small farmers."
"These farmers need to move on to a more sustainable business model. Right now they are living on charity through indirect subsidies like MSP and free electricity, Are the indian farmers not capable of living without charity?"
This devil only said in previous video to talk with Taliban as solution...and criticized Afghanistan investment. Now challenging Modi to ban Taliban... that's mean he's Pro-Taliban...and having strong confidence on Taliban and Hakani Network...he will support Palestine but not Afghanistan...you can see the hypocrites level of this  man!
"Just two minutes ago he himself told that MSP is a failure, and now he is saying that it is negative for farmers to not get the benefit of MSP"
Now wait for all those godi supporters to call farmers Khalistani terrorists 
If you really wanna know all about farm bills do watch Dr. Vikas Divyakirti Sir's  vedio on Drishti IAS instead of these so called ''intellectuals'' like him who can only give you a lopsided perspective on topics of national concern.
In up election bjp surely win. Then bjp creat this i cant belive. This creation need some peopile they creat this
"Farmers should not be swerved by the fake & swallow promises of the govt.Those farmers lost their lives in due course of farmers 's agitation, their relatives must be duly compensated!"
"Just curious, do Sikhs make up a majority of India's farmers? Most of those protestors belonged to the Sikh faith? Did Hindus farmers also protest against these agrarian reforms?"
Long Live Farmers.

No support to broker middleman mandi walas
"Quite dissapointed with Mrs. Supriya ( congress spokes person ), she is one of the few congressmen who raises the right question and generally well prepared. However, this time she seemed to only bring up Priyanka Gandhi's arrest and not really question the arrogance and mishandling of the situation by the state governament. "
"He should have gone and dried the farmers, anyway it is getting cold, so let's have fun.  "
"First of all, human by nature loves peace. And secondly, waging a war against any nation or group needs investment. Be it USSR or USA, today we all know what had happened to these countries. You lose people and money and nothing is gained. USA has invested 3 trillion dollars during these whole 20 years. We Indians talk about 3 trillion dollars economy but still we Indians die because of Corona. If you have lost some one or have watched news (not the Desh Bhakti ones), I am talking about NEWS which gives you information not a mentality of Hindu and Muslim then you must know how many we Indians have died during these pandemic. We Indians in 2021 are struggling, our GDP growth is the evidence of it. So, waging a war is not an option, yes no doubt if we push really hard to fight for it then we can win the war but the post war scenario will be really different, we may even become second Afghanistan in the world, there will be civil wars and protests all over the country. We Indians don't have to put our nose in some ones else matter. The best thing we can do is to remain neutral and analyse the situation as other neighbouring countries like China and Pakistan are doing. We don't want to waste money on stupid wars and give advantage to other countries like China or any neighbor country. And still if some people as I see here in the comment section who wants to show off by stating we can wipe out Afghanistan and Taliban, for your kind information, Afghanistan has seen war for the past 50 years and if you are good at history then you'll probably find out what advantages the Afghan people have in their home, mainly the geography of the country and not to forget that Taliban could do nothing without local people's support so what I am saying is Taliban has the upper hand no matter if USA or India intervene. The thing that Taliban doesn't want India to involve is because they don't want any useless bloodshed and it's the matter of their own country. If Taliban forms the government there in future then India should forget about other things and shake hands with them. Because our country has also invested 3 billions in developmental projects there. I can go on saying about all these but I don't want to because it's a matter of debate who wins or who lose, the rest depends on your knowledge and thinking. Jai Hind "
"Delhi police is waste under you CAA happened and now Farmer protest, what you guys are doing."
FARMERS MUST THANKS TO NDTV
", If we remove certain items from that list then prices will go high( daily use items like Oil, cereals etc ), It legalizes Storage of those items, Govt should remove that from the Bill and Its all good"
The government has egg on its face. Finally the farmers brought the government to its knees

Many Big farmers in India have bonded labourers in their field and they are talking about rights. Hypocrisy.
"This is so sad  today is our republic day ,we agree that you have problem with farm bill but atleast you can stop your protest on this day ."
Please stop blaming Pakistan because Pakistan paid a big price for the fight of America but enough is enough we don't want to be a play grounds for American
Thank you so very much for repealing the 3 farm laws on gurpurab  god bless you pm modi ji
"If he wants parity in Income with 1967 prices, than let there be Income Tax on agriculture. The farmers are spoilt by Political Parties bcuz of vote politics. If you add up all freebies and subsidies given to farm sector, they might b getting more than the cost of produce."
"Progressive farm laws have been repealed on the context of failure in getting some farmers of 2 and a quarter state on board in a large country is a problem, since its shows victory of mobocracy and anarchy. The template is laid out and succeeded in demonstrating that reforms aren't possible if a few rich (farmers/individuals) take the streets despite a thumping majority. Its a pity. BJP is not winning Punjab, neither Khalistani threat is going away with this move rather Government has projected weakness and cluelessness. Opposition will use this template for sure but its not good for the country since external forces and think tanks of China, Pakistan and Khalistani terrorists have taken congnisance too"
owners of agricultural land in Punjab who have not set foot in India for
"13:09 background singing is so on point. The amount of unity among Sikhs, and farmers in general, absolutely heart-melting. So true that Modi is always tweeting about USA and other nations and hasn't cared even once about our farmers. Always running after money be it PM cares fund or Adani and now these farm laws which will help the private companies again and get this government more money in their pockets. 60-70 Sikh died while protesting, 50+ days already. Shameless government. Thank you ScoopWhoop for getting us this content. I changed the bell icon to all notifications. You guys should start Patreon too. I would love to support you guys."
Pehle bjp ne election ke liye rally kurwaye ab congress rally kurwva raha farmer bill cover mein ..our nation is not in good hands
"Big cry day for Andhbhakt, modiji accepted demands of khalistani Deshdrohis "
Punjab BJP government hota hee too aise nehi hota. Congress ka pura support.  Congress desh barbat kiya economically
Modi should give one more good news by resigning from the post n handover it to someone educated like Swamy or someone else. Next he will sell india to Ambani or some rich clients.
"Honestly, I do support Indian farm workers due to the issue in which they are facing is similar to what happened in Mexico in 1994 in when the corrupt president of the PRI got elected, he proposed privatization in which his administration cut down on subsidies on small farm workers, collected up small plots of land and sold them to private corporations, and help corporations take control of farmland. This types of policies were disastrous in Mexico due to food prices rose dramatically, inflation became extremely high, the farm worker produced and was struggling a lot more. And a lot more Mexican farm workers fled to the US. I hope Indian Farm workers get these types of laws removed due to privatization is bad and important sectors like farming should be kept by the people not by corporations."
ALL INDIA KISANS MAZDOOR EKTA JINDABAD JINDABAD JINDABAD 
          Salute to Farmers who are struggling for survival of 75% population of the Nation linked with agriculture and  protesting against the atrocities of corporate politicians who are trying to giving control of National food grains in the hands of some corporaters for profit purposes.
2. Kishan bill Apas  hua ? Or drama of Modiji for the ensuing UP election. APAS bill kab pass hoga?
"Foolish decision by BJP..if they had to withdraw  d farmer's rule they should have have done frm begninng,why they spoiled d image of india ,so much allowed guspethhis n aantakwad...God only can save India"
These factors will help farmers produce natural crops and will save ecological balance
I am from bihar my whole family is in farming but they don't think there is any problem with this law because bihar don't get any benefit of green revolution and other farmers in my village are also have no problem.
"Leaving behind Jinaa Mughal  matter behind bjp must think to provide jobs to Youths, resolve farmers issues, must maintain peace and harmony amongst the communities. Jai Hind Jai Bharat."

"After repealing farm bill , many youtubers, tool kiters, opposition, so called farmers going to face severe shortage of foreign funding."
"In congress rule , the houses of Poor's were full of food grains and ithe essential items.  However Modi govt has reduced this quantity."
This is win of Anarchy over democracy. Protesting farmers were not even 5% of total farmers.
#in_solidarity_with_farmers
"This opposition is totally shit...earlier they want that this Law should be remove and now when the Parliament repeal the bill they need discussion... on such bills...this shows their mind set ....opposition doesn't want peace always opposing, and shouting....in the house..."
This came a little late just before elections. Remember that if Sardars can fight oppressive Mughals then they will also fight oppressive BJP.  A government must listen to the people's voice always.
This is victory of democracy. This shows that people are more powerful than government and capitalists. Govt will stand if keep people happy if they make people cry they will perish but it is too late for modi govt.
M.S.P.Lagoo hona chahia or Our P.M. ko M.S.P.Par Kanoon banana padega You Know What is M.S.P.  msp is .... Govt rate of wheat..1975.00 per qtl par AAj se 3month Apke wheat ka rate kya the 1570.00.

"Sir, farmers are also not against this bill, until the promises from government are not only words in air. They just need an assurance in written that  MSP should be paid to them, and why government cannot add this point into the bill. Getting profit from privatization will be just a bluff."
"Biggest mistake was messing with punjabi sikhs and their future livilhood and rights to land. They have been reminded of 1980s state oppression, injustice and genocide thats still unresolved. To add insult to injury they attacked sikhism, integrity of indian sikhs and declared all farmer protestors as khalistanis and terrorists. When rights enshrined in indian constitution are denied and hindered then india has become a dictatorial authoriterian state which it mostly has been since 1950s especially against the  brave Sikhs. Hence now karma will take its course and things will need to change to bring justice to the genocided, oppressed, powerless and voiceless."
The lady is trying to defame the farmers.
"Entire northeast is our farmers Go for it my dear brothers we are alwys with you...My dad is a farmer, and so do I."
Tareq creates Pakistanio phobia on India 
We should take inspiration from farmers and be prepared for 2023 polls...lets show what happens when you try do jhumla with public..
"What a land mark,historic revolution but also the most peaceful ever,only hope that the farmers dont loose their patience as the present govt is hell bent that the farmers do loose their cool and do something violent and the blame shift on the farmers thats the reason the farmer unions time and again request the farmers to be peaceful"
With farmers
* @3:30 It highlighted Bihar as the least performing state as a result of lack of mandis but not Kerala and other states which rank higher in the same list and still have no APMC mandis.  
 WE MUST SUPPORT FARMERS.
Farmers biggest march against Modi. Better than outsourced brahminical headed IT. Look at the unconnected losers muted: Narayana Murty Nilekani Ambani Tata who are day trading.
"the bill seems to be very beneficial for farmers, what basis are they protesting them about. how would the farmers lose, there is so much opportunity around this for building a farmer society and many employment opportunity will also raise in this regard."
"I don't understand when government thinks that it's good for farmers then instead of talking to them who are  sitting near Delhi Borders , they are going here and there and throwing the tantrums .."
"No farmers,  no food , starve. Simple."
Those who are speaking against the farmers they watch only and only t.v.'s bogus news.
Very shameful act by farmer
Fantastic farmers  
Uchit routes ko police ne force aur baricades lga kr bnd kr diya . Tabbi farmers doosre km force walae routes pr chle gye..
"It just hurts seeing Indians fighting  against each other , and at that time when we shall show our maximum support to our nation"
"'Der aaya, durust aaya' ka kya matlab hai sir !. Aap hamesha congress ko hi kyu support karte ho!  As a teacher, you should be a impartial and unbiased !!!!!!!!"
"Ive been following the whole kisaan andolan progress, please farmers should continue to protest peacefully, government are sending people to create violences, to bring division among the united farmers, for all these days the protest was peaceful, we dont know how and where these provocations are coming from, but as per videos and leaders, they are government people... One message: Farmers should stay UNITED!"
"Why? You better bring it back with another policy. C'mon man, I loved you for this. Farmers needed this. Tikait won. Congi-librus and pseudo-communists won."
You didn't tell anything about new farm bill and started comparing it 
"The laws favored Ambani Adani types, MSP is the solution for farmers being ripped off, Nitish did not discuss this for some reason. All farm leaders including Tikait are pro MSP"
#isupportfarmers...
Farmers unity zindabad
"Problem is only 2 state was following the MSP properly..  so the farmers over there having the problem.. but they still have the option to continue with the same. Just the farmers who don't want to sell in maandi , they can move out and find other options.."
One must notice the camps of pro farmers and against farmers in several news forums. It's cut throat hate levels. I  am growing anxiety related to men in ours society. My father was right that BJP would be catastrophic for our country!
If you're stating the truth then say ki farmers have to negotiate not dectate terms.
There's a lot of drawbacks in the current form market where the middlemen gets bulk of the profit. It's very essential to weed them out and create a market where farmers can directly bargain with the buyers.
Hi SO absolutely zee hindustan live news around the world
" Basically, these bills are for the benefit of farmers. Ultimate goal is , farmers should be paid more, no more suicides, better and sustainable farming techniques, and more security of farmers interest."
"What about recent farm bills sir , farmers are claiming they are meant to remove MSP ... What's the problem in farm bills...and sir they are claiming they are being pushed towards corporate sector.. which is not good for them"
Hopefully....our farmers brother will welcome .. and help IND grow 
I am a farmer from Assam and I say that your analysis and explanation is excellent. Keep up the good work.
It seems the protesting farmers are clueless and don't have the authority to decide. The power to decide lies else where.
"Real farmers (not the wolves in the sheepskin ) enjoyed,reaped the benefits of the 3 farm laws for nearly a year....."
FSP - Farmers Spot Price
2. Government has limited fixed allotted money to buy produce from farmers at price fixed by government. So rest produce is purchased by middlemen at much lower price.
800+ Farmers died in Process
I don't see any farmers here
45%congress+45 % AAP+10%extremists= 100%farmers Andolan
Guarantee this farmers attacked the car first and when they tried to run these people cried victim
Shame on farmers who did not understand the importance of these laws.
3) 3 farmer bill achhe hai
What is market price ? Modi should explain how a farmer can fix price for his produce using these laws ..
"I am from Bangalore people in.metro are mislead by mainstream media, please make videos in English and South Indian languages as well so whole country is United in the heavenly cause if there is god please bless our farmers"
"Thanks for supporting Farmers, You say everything true,,Shame on media,,From now media is not free press it's bounded."
"I am always   with u sir, I also think msp must be there with our farmers. "
"Repealing the 3 laws clearly points out to the fact that the government has succumbed to political pressure, vote Bank looking at the state elections but it is definitely not a good precedence as other laws like CAA and 370 await the same outcome which indeed will further fuel andolans,dharnas,blocking roads creating nuisance  in the name of resistance ..We  can't afford this to be a norm."
This cleared everything about Farm Bills! Much grateful to you for this.
Abolishing APMC in bihar has had very bad effect. Farm laws are likely to create monopoly of corporates. States should create a cooperative mechanism. Bottom line is if Farmers do not want the law then why force a law. Surely someone else is benefited. If government wants to do away with MSP then government should  state that clearly.
Salute to 700Farmers who
"You are supporting black laws by your headlines- 'Sarkar baatcheet ko tyar, fir kyun takrar'."
Farmers  the real heroes of India... Who are ready to die for our future.. 
Happy republic Day dear farmers
You forgot the election angle in repealing farm laws
"We the people of Bihar strongly support the Farmers Bill 2020, this law gives special options to the farmers,"
You pose a question if farm bills are right or wrong but you present the facts with such biased inclination that the bills seem right which isnt the fact
Nice effort to decode farmbill 2020 by Mr.Pratik Gupta.
"Thank u so much sir, for the information. I work as gram panchayat secretary this information will help me in guiding the farmers, I will share this video with my friends too...thank you sir."
You can see the intention of the govt right from the start when it goes with the ordinance route. Then where are those farmers and farmer orgs who approached govt and asked for these glorious pro farmer moves.these defintely didnt come from the farmer.you can watch such videos and get an inkling where these ideas are coming from.then in which privatization Is the right of one party to approach court taken away?.this  apec formula is already there in bihar.i think media needs to go and visit bihar and study the mess its agriculture is in.and what is this one market nonsense? Farmers and buyers with resources even now buy and sell from anywhere.now how to make it so that all farmers can do it needs govt setup storage and improve transport and infrastructure. The answer is not setting everything to be sold to corporates.
"Every govt organization that was supposed to help people had become a mafiadom, not only APMC. If it is so easy to make APMC work in an orderly manner then why in 55 years has it only been degrading through multiple govts? I have seen how the farmers suffer because of this. If anybody dares to take his/her produce directly to the market he/she is quickly brought under control through threats."
Farmers I salute you all and support you all.
Chacha bookish economy aur farming ke field m bht farq hota hai .khash krke farmer exploitation ko rokne ke liye 
"This farmers agitation will be remembered in the hundreds of years ahead. Congratulations to our farmers. Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan."
Mixing hathras rape in farmers protest is deviating from mob lynchings..
"New Laws acche hai ya galat I don't know, but govt mai dono options dena chahiye. Ye farmers pe options rehna chahiye, jo farmers new law ko select karte hai, toh future mai agar government ke new laws se faide ho rahe hoange toh old laws ya mandi wale farmers apneapp new laws join kar leange. Lekin options de govt purana tarika ya new tarika, choose anything"
Pls keep posting videos covering farmer's protest. 
Modi ji ki beard kam hui wese hi petrol price or attitude bhi kam ho gya.. he is good pm but can be best if he takes care of indian economy and people more properly.. 
"Rakesh tikat fake   , bicholi, broker of bipakshi birodhi ... May not have ploughed and hard worked ever in the fields to generate produce low cost yeild fasal for small tenant farmers."

Farmers will win
"Madam, there is one fundamental mistake in your video. Tax given by traders in APMC Mandi and not by farmers. double check your facts before making such videos."
"*Allowing court trial for such disputes is never going to benefit, either by the farmer or against the farmer*"
"I Demand Bharat ratna for rakesh sir,the way he is fighting for the rights of 70% farmer population if India "
I want an overview on the topic of the ongoing protest of farmers 2020 to 2021 ..Within tommrow
The P M of this country clearly says that he has no interest for the Farmers of this country nor for the poor. He hails himself the back born of Corporates....If you have some goodness in you please open your mouth and speak out on Farmers' killing by BJP neta ke beta..
Please support for Indian farmers and thanks BBC news
India has 600 million farmers.
Love and respect the farmers as they are very important people.
Wow! Our BJP government pass 15 Bills in 2 days and all the opposition was absent  and it is totally undemocratic 
Rakesh Tiket the Net worth 80Cr poor farmer. Has left the innocent farmers on boarder :D
All should do a Google once to know the details of farmer suicides across the country for decades and the root causes....and which govts failed utterly
There are lot of Benefits to the farmers they just cut the rich middle men who exploit farmers these are rich middmen who are protesting
"Seems for the moment a good decision from an electrol perspective, but how long the reforms are going to getting stalled like this especially when this is  an issue only related to vested interest of some section of one state or a rich section belonging to one  caste  and rest of the india is not much worried or rather its more of a beneficial law , Let me ask a question why a particular state or caste needs to be  kept silent by   feeding with money that can be spend for greater good for the country ? Especially this will impact only the middleman and so called farmers will be still under their control and their own fate, Other states have shown better results and moved forward. Every law needs to be discussed and gov used an opportunity to bypass the parliament , I believe government did give enough explanation in parliament and most political parties have.this reform as a part of their manifesto no one have guts to implement it  , l can understand if it is related to land reforms  or if it impacts regional, linguistic or cultural aspects or major constitutional amendments except for 370 and 371, of this nation that definitely needs a wider discussion and more careful analysis,Even a law that has wider implications was passed without much deliberation or less discussion ie NEP, So according to Sekhar Sir's logic any law that impacts Punjab or Haryana or Western UP needs to be discussed explicitly discussed in Parliament and rest is fine or can be ignored, Sorry I don't take to this point.May be a bit harsh but it's a fact."
So so happy for the farmers
"sir very good, but kindly brief that why this govt is in so hurry that these bills have to pass without any debate  and afraiding to face the questions from farmers.  secondly the word MSP is not being added in these bills. who will deal with contracting farming, means only specialist or big players in this industry want to control on whole farming sector as they know very well that this sector has wide scope to earn. please also advise that these bills should be openly debated in public and after finalise conclusion, these bill may be brought up."
"Ha, ye sahi hain. Jab farm laws hain to protest kiya ja raha hain hatane k liye. Ab hatane ka procedure shuru hua hain to protest kar rahe hain repeal k against. Arre bhai chahte kya ho ?"
Vice didn't even througly  discuss the new farm bills .
WE ARE HARMING THE NATION BY THESE COMMENTS -- MODI JI IS DOING NO ONE WOULD HAVE EVER IMAGINED -- NEED TO HAVE SOME PATIENCE !
I think we youth should start farming with new technology and make India no1 in agricultural production
Every government is like a mother to their population. But in case of Muslims and BJP the relationship  is of between  step mother and step son.
We are all Indians support farmer 
"Just one thing to mention here, as you said there should be one intermediary between company & farmers. what are the chances that the intermediary will not treat farmers as traders are doing?"
All india support you ravish Kumar   NDTV
permission was just a drama they had planning for farmers but this time they cant stop farmers
"Hooligans not Farmers protesting in the most non violent way possible. Our National Flag was desecrated. Totally unacceptable to indulge in arson, rioting and waging war against the Nation."
Truth is that unless and until the Hindus enter the streets... their voice will not be heard in India.. Whether its BJP or congress or something else. Ram Mandir is there just because few brave Hindus decided to enter the streets and dismantle the structure built over Ram Lalla
I can clearly see the impact of godi media
Govt repealing farm lawa : Congress still have problem  
"Undoubtedly it is defeat of poor farmers of the country and the victory of those who are fraud , criminals , destroyer and blind ."
Please support indian farmers...protest still going on...foriegn media help us..modi government is crushing us please help...
It's setback for farmers development
What is the demand of these farmers?? Pehle yeh toh batao... bekar me time waste kar diya
Congratulations  Farmers
Real Farmers is at FARM right now
Its defeat of real farmers today. Again politics wins over development again in India. I think now real farmers should educate themselves and ask the question to their leaders.
"keep doing, last govt change his rubbish decision on farmer rights"
"Apart from that I am a Muslim who learnt from Sikhs that how to be proud of your religion and maintain it as they practically teach me by showing there identity everywhere whether it's india , Canada or America or Saudi Arabia . "
Its kinda embarrassing to see how half of the people didnt even know how the farmer bills are affecting the farmers
they are middle maan not kisan any funded by outside india.
Its in better interest of india to not throw stones in bee hive ( taliban )
"Yogendra Yadav says that farmers are already allowed to sell products to private traders. They also showed the fact that 94% of farmers are already selling their products to private traders. Now, how come all of sudden the data will be gone? I think that is a BS argument."
This is winning of farmers and opposition
"Farmers' Protest., "
So why do Punjabi farmers benefit from MSP while the other Indian farmers do not. That's not fair either. So either all farmers should get MSP or none at all.
"I am sorry, after watching your video, I feel that u stress too much on negativity of farmers n very quick statement (unnoticed) on negativity of central government / Delhi Police. FARAK  PADTA HAI"
"1. Might lead to hoarding and black marketing. (Majority of the farmers are S&M, storing their own crops can be a tough task, on the other hand the revision of EC list can give Corporates an upper hand to Store & Manipulate the price to their benefit)"
I support farmers culprit should be arrested
"Those are expensive vehicles and farmers from pujab is very rich.But others are not.If government takes back this act, then definitely we will protest.Govt.isnt fool that goes against others for the sake of just 1-2 state."
Look India media. I have many Punjabi friends. One thing I know about them is they are never wrong. I support farmers from my country.
Farm law may come back after election
Government don't care about farmers at all. 
These  protests create history in india to protect our kisaan and our democracy
"Happy for the farmers! Democracy won yesterday, Freedom will have to wait for tomorrow!"
Bjp out from india
My farmers is god
Revolution stage: Modi stops roads now farmers will attack by drones.
"No matters if y'all Indian or not. They supply food from all over the world! No Farmers, no Food! So stand up! Or else, y'all ain't have onions on your steak! #standwithfarmers"
Violence is condemned by farmers but why to force laws which are not required to those citizens for whom these are enacted. Government is full of Highly Intelligent people so From PM TO CM need to take decision. 
If reforms do not come to agriculture space and Punjab then our agriculture  is going down the drain. And in terms of Punjab there will not be any ground water left in 10 years if current practices are not changes . Shame on these farm protest leaders
"It is a drama, after the symbolic agitation of BKS, the Modi govt will agree on framers issue and it will be circulated that it is because of RSS and which will minimise the electral damage of BJP in upcoming UP election."
"As per the Agriculture Census of 2015-2016, 86% of farmers are small and marginal (less than 2 hectares). How much bargaining power will they have in a free market? How will they go and find a market for their produce? Also how will they decide what is the correct price and that they are not being cheated? Are these small and marginal farmers going to receive any training? The concern the farmers have is how will they be connected to the free market. Although they have the option of APMC. But wouldn't the big corporates use their powers to ultimately make the APMCs unsustainable in the long run? That would make MSP redundant. All these are valid concerns that should be taken into account. How can a law be passed without consulting the stakeholders/beneficiaries for whom it is being made? The RSS affiliates like Swadeshi Jagran Manch and Bharatiya Kisan Sangh are also opposing it. Are they also being manipulated by the opposition parties? Shekhar Gupta ji, you have not analyzed the issue properly. Sorry, did not expect this from a senior journalist like yourself."
I support government of India for all the law and regulations implement by them to make India a better place. Strict action needed to make country better.
I think these bills were  milestone for farmers  and govt shouldn't took step back  some modifications can be done by govt but replenishment of bills will impact on farmers in a long term
"As a literature student I would like to add that the fears of our farmers are part of the traditional folklore/folk-belief. If you look at folklore from any agricultural communities you find atleast one villain who is Seth/Zamindar/Sahukar extorting the poor farmer/peasant/laborer. This had amplified during the colonial era with horrific famines and almost 200% tax. So when nationalist movement invited farmers to join protest, it gained nationalist color as farmers from across the country came together. This narrative was recalled during Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan era and during various CPI movements in Bengal and Kerala. So it was only natural that when farmers were told that they will directly deal with buisnessmen, they panicked. Its almost the Krishna-Kans dichotomy."
Thanks to BBC from Bottom of Heart. This will energies Farmers against dreadfull Laws .( Ex Pharmacy Officer Moga Pb  Bharat)
#istandwithfarmers
"We are not in the regim of cowards Congress, we are in leadership of Hon modiji and can stand strongly and bring anyone in its knees."
whole world is watching farmers protest . Good work !! finally a new channel where we can see some real news updates
Thats not how a real farmer would stack sugarcanes in a trolley. Clearly this is scripted. Those farmers didn't even know the laws.
Opposition wants to destroy our farmers . Media should play a positive role in explaining correct position . Otherwise these anti nationals /opposition parties would destroy India .I  my India.
"Is the objectionable three farm laws brought by Modi government worth their merit, with the continuing opposition by the Indian farmers? And the happenings?"
"Is it stone age or talibani public..farmers themselves sitting on roads blocking movement..Courts, governments must stop this high handedness by farmers..too much politics into this..system being mocked every day..where is this so called peaceful andolan going..Charuni, Tikait all responsible...instead of taking n listening to sense, they are creating an empire of their own..Stop this non sense.."
Reject modi's govt! Reject modi's govt. May it rott in Hell .
Modhi is right on this one by curtting welfare from farmers.
Congratulations to farmers....
"I think Central Govt should announce that a Committee headed by Mr. Satya Pal Malik will look after the issues related to agri , MSP implementation and all farmer related issues and will submit its report within 6 months. The SKM leader will immediately call the agitation."
"PRICE RISING HIGH and FARMERS Not getting the right amount. 12 hrs duty, unemployment, But only one ISSUE  Religion."
This decision is taken by keeping in mind upcoming elections in Punjab and UP
"Ask pakistan for aid. They already gave Afganistan the taliban, so why not a way to live?"
"1st it became Khalistan movement as we had seen redfort, indian flag was removed,"
I am not a farmer even I have agriculture land and supporter of Kisan Morcha from the beginning. I suggest you to open Toll Plaza as it must effect the development of Punjab in future. It is my humble request only.
Peoples power baby. I support these farmers.
"What about the pollution in Delhi...Its because of the farmers...Supreme court has asked them not to burn it but they still do...If a corporation owns the land government can fine the company,which is not possible with individual farmers"
This is not victory of Indian farmers it's a win of Congress and co Dallas
When Krishna avoided fighting with jarasanth and leave Mathura and create a place called Dearika. HE IS GOD and by Sudarsan chakra He can easily killed him. Instead as if HE was running from Mathura. Like that Modiji may have a plan and for that Punjab election may be vital. Now He may face criticism and we may come to know the reason later. I am sure GOD is taken full control and HIS plan will be done and who knows what is in store for the World.
Corona affected persons must be asked to caugh and shake hands and hug these farmers so that they can never think of protests.
"If APMCs and MSPs are here to stay and the new Bill is providing additional option, Im failing to still understand what the problem is. ? What am i missing. Farmers can continue to seek in APMCs - whats the challenge. "
This provatisation will being innovation to farming and promote plant diversification modi is best these pajeet manjeet singh run towards kanneda who dont even gove msp they have private farming so why they oppose these bills ?
"Some parts of laws are problematic. It doesn't allow the farmer to go to court if they feel they are wronged by the dealers. The highest official for that is SDM. That is creating fear in farmers. Why govt. had to add this extra bit in the laws? If tomorrow you are wronged by someone and not allowed to go to court by some new law, would you not oppose it? Would like to know SG's view on this."

"Very interesting,  humble request please invite fresh    to  your  show  for   discussion  on current national political  scenario and pre & post farmer protest changing  in nation. I think  he is more eligible  for answering  your serious questions. "
"Your ""analysis"" (barely) is a perfect example of your biases. Out of the 7 minutes and 46 seconds, you have spent over 5 minutes talking about the troublemakers and how they should have followed rules, and less than 20 seconds on what the causality was. Sitting on a moral high horse and telling farmer leaders to maintain peace is easy, but if you have over a million followers listening to you, the least you can do is explain to them what could have caused this unrest and violence. Kya aapko sach mein ""Farak padta hai""?"
2) - Farmers (empowerment and protection) agreement on price assistance and farm services act -
Farmer protest shayad hi khatam ho. Inke leaders ne election ladna ha. Koi aur demand like Guarantee of MSP beech me le aayenge.

9th concept of assured income is going to come in near future not only for farmers but for every one...please read about Universal Basic Income...but govt have to decrease its wasting of money to implement this
people living in big cities can not feel how the farmers are suffering
"2. Government middle man hatana chahti hai taki farmers exploit na ho commission se, lekin farmers ka ye kehna hai ki unhe middle man ki services ki bhi zarurat hai, transportation cost bachti hai, kyunki baar baar farmer apni produce market mei lae, agar rates naa mile to ghar vaapis lekar jae, isse transportation cost increase hoti hai aur produce kharab hone ka bhi dar rehta hai. Moisture , humidity iska bohot role rehta hai crop ko deteriorate karne mei, phir storage cost. Produce/ Crop uttarna , chardhana , har ek choti se choti  cheez ka rate hota hai, lekin ye sab middle man karta hai to farmers islye isse oppose kar rhe hain, lekin vo commission bhi leta hai , isliye government hatana chahti hai. Farmers ye bhi bolte hain ki agar kabhi unhe paise ki zarurat hoti hai emergency mein to vo middle man ke pass jaa skte hain, fertilizers kareedne hon ya kuch aur. Paise lagte hain farming karne mein , free mein nhi hoti bhai ya behen, gender dekh kar lga lena."
Thank you so much for covering this!! Kisaan mazdoor ekta zindabad
Support farmers need justice for farmers
"Even French, Chinese,British  Monarch bow before peasants & farmers revolution than who is modi"
Thank you for being voice of Farmers 
There were some media channels which went to great lengths to explain the benefits of these farm laws. Begs the question now are these laws good or BAD. What about those farmers who died during the protests.
"This act is casued definitely by the close ally of Democratic indias first Terrorist Kotse's group, this is dangerous to India if political parties starts operating with such violoance group as part of their poilitical careers India will be ruined,, this kind of act was used largely against Arvind kejrival during election campaign, During NRC protests as welll"
Well done by farmers ..they know the laws better than any one relating to thier field...
Real problem of msp of crop real farmer's are facing problem
Sad for real farmer as a my half family/relatives are farmer 
Farmers are right!!!!!
1 bro i agree with ur point but when farmers were protesting from last 2 months they did not listen to us meetings were non resultable cnn u imagine 2 months it this cold more than 80 farmers died
There's no mention of that farmers can't go to HC or SC in case of dispute with private company.
"It is all very good to say that the farmer can sell anywhere but, does he have the resources to take it? Does he have the resource to fight the sharks who dictate prices? Have the laws been made understandable for them? Does he have the resource to resist corporate pressure to grow what he wants instead of what the corporates dictate? This is all a farce. Where is the infrastructure for the farmers before this law can be effected?"
No Farmers meand  No Foods
This is British style plan that army and farmers which are savior of India  open to fight on ground
"Zee news and Aaj Tak media showing only other part and asking ""kya ye Kisan h""....yeah those are farmers only that tolerating all your political drama.."
Modi ji hav given an example of Democracy The repeal isnt good bt wht can be done.....
"I fully agree, Here we have a chance to create a strong Hindu party as an alternate to BJP."
Please take post a video on why farmer's commit suicide.
Throw congress out of India ..Then oly india will go to nxt level ..
The person who stopped that water canon as we saw that video was accused of attempt to murder and almost every farmer leader is threatened by  gov with income tax department is sending them notices
Actually Modi government was too adamant.actually bjp always doing favour for corporate.
Governmundlinguistic error. But still cute but as always my full support to farmers. Aap sab bole to hum sare nojawan bhagat singh banne ko tayaar hai
Thanks for your social media support regarding Indian Farmer's...need more from everyone
"Also, this agitation is ignited by land owners(large tracts of land of Dalits, the oppressed community was grabbed during Khalistan movement), not the cultivators and workers who actually who work in farms and are treated in subhuman ecosystem"
I am fighting with my family cause they are brainwashed by godi media. I was successful to change their view by showing scoopwhoop video. So proud of you samdhish and team. I request you if you could cover the situation on 25th and 26th of jan so we get real news. Thank you. Jai kisan. Jai hind. Wish i could help our kisans in someway.
Shame on india govt and bjp ministers
"After losing by the farmers' movement, the Prime Minister withdrew the agricultural rules but the news reporter is all Modi-loyal so he cannot tell the truth."
after being hit by police and army .....farmers still fed langar to  hungry police and army  
Let me just tell u that all these laws are already there in Western countries  ... Though we support our farmers but laws have both good n bad and good are more than bad... No one can predict future but currently they seem beneficial
"Feku ka ghamand aur obscene haughtiness got shattered. Each time bj party is defeated, india progresses. Defeat them in UP and see how great india will become."
Those who say this is shameless they never felt shame on our govt when 150+ farmers died(gave shaheedi) while protesting
This is the saddest and most wholesome protest ever done in India . Respect to the farmers and kudos to the Scoopwhoop Unscripted team .
Govt wants to give the farmers land to their rich friends . ..Ambani nd so on ..
I m from Pakistan Punjab i will support farmers .. shame on u Indian politics nd police
"Whatever happened was not right, but completely blaming farmer and calling them anti-national is ALSO NOT  right This is the same DL Police which attacked STUDENTS sitting in JMI Library. Everyone here knows how the bill was made, passed. Mending things/ situations according to their comfort and sensibility"
All delhites are in full support of farmers
"China and India's military both made frontpage headlines in every country recently. China - Hypersonic missiles defying physics maneuverable unstoppable, evade all tracking radars. India - Helicopter crash with literally every important military personnel. Most senior commander, captain, general, officers, chief, squadron leader all onboard."
Respect farmers Save farmers!!!
Best suggestion by Rakesh tikait
I am son of farmer from Gujarat. 
"Farmers have every right to protest, but they should keep it symbolic with less people and follow the protocols.  This way the struggle also can be sustained until success.  They have shown how they count in WB elections."
"so it,s duty of farmers to help the govt."
"Both are correct ,debate must happen in Parliament, in the farmers point they expressed their concern,if the govt agreed to give MSP ,I think it is good reform."
 Farmers don't need degree for it.
"My dear first you understand bill properly ""contract with farms means making live licences agreement contract with kisan on his land by private company's. Forexp: if company want tomato farmers has to grow tomatos only on his land and what ever price has has decided in agreement any how kisan has to sale to company at that price even if he gets good price in mandi he cant sale his products with anybody else. Even if gov says this clause is not on land its on ""fashal"" which is grown by kisan vice versa it means the same. Any how if kisan gets 5% advantage with this bill clause there is 95% of losses plz focuse on that. British time companies also used to do same thing. "
We are with them .Delhi walo come out of your house and support Farmers
"Ravish the Mahapanchayat  was,  mark my words a day history of this country will remember when we look back in the history of India. Naturally the historians who are writing the present day will try to write otherwise. The farmers have given the message loud and clear and even if for graceful exit if not for politics the government should pay attention to their demands. If not,  Vinashkale Viparit Buddhi will be so apt and fitting a proverb."
Sir I am CDS aspirant but my father is a farmer in UP. This video help me in SSB.
Lone from Tamil Nadu We stand with the farmers. And you should also know about the protest by Tamil farmers a few years back in Delhi.
" 1) Even though the corporates can have contracts with farmers but at the same time, farmers have the choice to either sell it to the company or to market as per their profitability. "
Farmers  who feel sad should  have co.e out to the streets to support. Why did they not?
"Zee  channel is BJP channel, so how come they speak against BJP.."
Well done Modiji. We will see does our farmers need more per growth and that too directly to their account.  jai hind
"this protest would come to an end, If farmers could see this video instead of news."
"Please do a Hindi & Punjabi version of this and distribute it widely in your home state of Punjab, so that the farmers really get educated and know the truth."
modi also asked MSP as CM nothing  wrong if farmers ask
but dhruv ;these city ppl do not understand our farmers problem;media plays a very dirty role
"LMAO. Now Punjab is open for the BJP. And Congress doesn't have material, surprised Pikachu faces.."
I support Farmers.
Zee news official spokesperson of BJP
"Your caption ""Prime Minister announces HUGE RELIEF to farmers is Inappropriate. Change it.  Your caption is made to appear as if the farmers have been /are undergoing the sufferings due to unjustified misdeeds of someone else and the Prime Minister has come forward to eradicate the sufferings of farmers"
Although u told about farmer side of the protest it's incomplete ......the people protesting are actually not farmers but middleman who take a lot of commissions which results in higher price than the farmer sells there goods.
"It's d duty responsibility of one and all to protest against black laws, protest against evm, against godi media, against all contentious laws ..and make india, prosper as ever"
"Why are all protesters here Panjabis? Why have they come to UP to protest ? Are there no kissans in up , bihar or west bengal ? Where from are they getting huge money to roam over india without doing any work? They are not any way farmers."
"Well explained.  The reform looks good in paper, but opening up the market to private players doesn't guarantee and a smooth transaction. The issues of APMC price management can also pop up when big private corps step in. Similarly the misuse in contract farming can also be suppressive to the farmers. The farm laws arnt perfect, however they could have been sent a parliamentary standing committee before being passed hastily without in depth expert inputs."
Could you please explain the reasons why farmers are protesting in another video
Thank you modi for the peace..last year was CAA and now farmers protest have escalated to a whole different level.. Achae din..
"I'm strongly support modi, but if bjp bring this bill,,than believe me bjp forget about center, they can't even getting any provincial govt. & first-time rahul saying right, i know even he doesn't know anything about this matter, "
I just love to see congress and Aam Aadmi party supporters arguing against Modi for their personal reasons on the other hand the response of Bhakts are also incredible.
Hon'ble Ajit Anjum It's your true Journalism services rendered to the farmers and public. Welcome you.
Somehow I seriously cannot accept any negative comments on Modi. I think he would had thought enough on each scenario. The way they tackled 370 abrogation is nothing when compared with Farm bill. 
"Brave Farmers! Listen to them, they bring you food !"
"To the publication group, and anyone reading this from Scoop Whoop, I know that Samdish Bhatia is in centre of politics. He is not a Right Wing Supporter nor the Left, but I want to request you to make a totally separate series. With zero ads, zero promotions, zero sarcastic Samdish, you guys know that PMO India is doing very wrongful acts. Just 10 Videos of 10 minutes Samdish Bhatia seriously telling the exact truth he know, I am following Samdish from 3-4 years now and my gutt tells me that Samdish can bring the change. Samdish Brother if you ever read this comment I just beg you to do your serious MANN KI BAAT. You have the voice which people crave for, you have the viewership people dream of. Please Scoop Whoop and Please SAMDISH BHATIA. This decade can turn India back to what it was or to a gangland with riots every day every night. Samdish Bhatia you didnt got sold out to politician be fuckin* proud of yourself and bang this government. Respect your Reporting"
3. Farmer is at the mercy of these middlemen to purchase his produce. Basically exploitation of farmers happen.
Modi will become the President & pass on the mantle to either Amit Shah or Yogi ( tho he will be the second option )
The farmers are protesting in a peaceful manner.And more important they are protesting not just for themselves but for every common men because it will effect the common man the most.
Rakesh Tikait  Sir Great Farmer Hitaishi
"Even farmers seems bunch of hooligans , may have forced police to this extent..."
"i would like to say I'M nuetral here because i dont know what the farm laws are but if farmers wanna protest they can and have rights to do it, but why do they wanna attack police officers i mean they can make fun of the govt and stuff they can burn down modi's posters all that is alright but pls dont attack police officers they are only doing their job u think they wanna do all this no its their job to protect their country and thats what their doing so please sont target police offficers, i agree that some of them are mad and doin inhumane things but most of them are not doing much."
Samdish bro thanks alot plzz make more videos love you  and big respect for you also kisaan Majdoor ekta zindabad 
I wish you had done a bit of research with the farmers on ground level instead of stating these statistics in order to justify these black laws. The farmers grow wheat and paddy because of sure shot income guarantee and yet they are pressed in debt and farmers suicides are rising day by day. If they take away the procurement system that guarantee will end. The idea of this law seems wonderful on paper but each and every farmer in punjab has had worse experiences selling to private players and contract farming eg. Pepsico buying potatoes. This is the main reason for the wheat paddy cycle continuation. 
Best explanation about farm bill in YouTube well done ma'am and your team 
Actually this decision of repeal will impose only negative consequences on the actual poor farmers in the long run.
"Good explanation, thanks.  It seems that the farmers have found effective ways to impact the country in a way that makes them hard to ignore. May the greed driven encroachments be turned back before they further harm these vulnerable farmers."
They won to keep the farmers and theie lives like same as 70 years they are living
"2) Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, "
First of all this is not modi's farm bill it is represented  by government of india
Most of the farmers give there land for cultivation on barter system
And secondly now the people who are protesting are not farmers they are the middle man (arthi) and the anti national people because we farmers feed the whole country and doing things like that is not the work of farmers ... 
Pakistan and china funding these protests using punjab ruling congress party
We as Indians without a doubt should support our beloved farmers and hope the government and farmers find a solution. 
"6. Food security undermined? Right now our buffer stocks are 90 million tonnes of food grains while we need only 41 million tonnes of food grains. Therefore we are already food surplus. We are now producing 1.75 kg food grains per capita per day, while we need hardly 1/2 kg (500 gms) of food per capita per day. In addition our Nominal protection coefficient is on an average 0.87 indicating that we can export and earn 13 percent higher price abroad. Therefore all the 3 laws are useful for farmers. There may be need for some small changes such as approaching civil court for dispute resolution, and these may be accommodated. Else the entire Act in its entirety is helpful to farmers."
Thank you for good journalism   godi media need training from vox
"Regarding, the court settlement of disputes, do they want to drag these honest, poor and innocent farmers to the web of lengthy, expensive, cumbersome legal procedures of Indian judicial system???. Nowadays, it is taking more time to get a dispute redressal in a reasonable manner. You must also note that most of SDM's are young IAS recruits who entered the system with the utmost vigour, competence and ardent devotion to doing good for the society. You should also note that the workload of a local judge is more than the same as an SDM. Of course, no system is perfect and blemishes-free. Even if a farmer is allowed the option to approach the court, there is no guarantee he/she will get a suitable redressal because of the widespread corruption in the Indian legal system. So, I suggest each and every one approach the issue in a more open and unbiased manner. We cannot allow our emotions to rule over the visible facts, figures and realities. I know I am not that educated but I always try to approach an issue in an honest way without any prejudices."
During the bye polls BJP lost in the places where farmer's agitation was going on. To save western UP during state elections BJP has taken back the three farm laws. Time will tell whether this will be successful.
I don't understand why farmers let Ashish Mishra go from that place and why did they beat his driver and other people only. Itni bheed me usko akeleko jane kyo diya baki sabko peeta to?
tickat should become p m of next  india he is bachpai of congress
"AIMs very last statement was a strong humor, but that is a reality, the way Modi disappointed this time, IslamoChristianity is looking very possible, it doesnt need 25 years any more, it will be in next 3-5 years, Modi should have resigned instead of repealing Farm laws. I am taking depression pill now. Sad, so sad. I need to consult doctor"
Govt is responsible for this. Farmers are fighting for the benefit Indians except few rich.
"According to pradhan sevak n hagna runout there are no issues in farm bills...farmers have been misled,so are the doctors who are now called as urban naxals "
"While the farmers might have won the battle, India lost the war. This ensures India stays an agricultural society for decades to come."
"Our top priority should be safeguarding our borders with Pakistan so that no terrorism can spill onto our side of the border. Afghan themselves are responsible for their own freedom. Russia, China both have accepted Taliban as a reality. We shouldn't really get involved in this mess."
They are not farmers. They are goons of local political parties...
The farm laws were  good for the small farmers and hurt the middleman and corruption.
I always stand with you modi ji
Tikat is never going to  be happy.  What has he done for farmers with his black money. Or helped farmers.  Nothing. He is mixed with anti elements. So nothing can happen..
Thank you for this breakdown! Here in my country the USDA is going to start taxing livestock farms for their methane. (Literally a tax on animal flatulence) I feel like the governments around the globe are messing with the food supply
"Andhbhkts who called farm protest as international conspiracy are today talking about democracy. Andhbhkts who called farmers as traitors, anti-nationals, goons, khalistani are today talking about national interests. Even a chameleon don't change colour so fast. "
"Allahamdulilha ... Farmers are real warriors !!!!,"
Migrant Sikh farmers own and occupy large tracts of Benami farm lands in Terai regions owned by clearing forest and pastoral lands in the Terai regions fearing government action there has been conflicts over several decades.
"@5:40 The aartiya middlemen might be good people in Punjab, where farmers have substantial awareness, unity and financial stability (86% farmers in India hold land below 1 Hectare, but avg land held by per farmer in Punjab is 3.62 Hectares!) Its difficult to exploit them. BUT that's not the case in other states. Where poor farmers farmers having less than 1 Hectare often get exploited by middlemen."
"Thanks For This Video, Make Me Proud As a son Of Farmer "
Salute u brother for covering! It's painful to see farmer's condition. I can say something for sure they aren't the ones involved in the riots happened in today's rally
"Oh... We have a Supreme Court.. After more than 500 Death in the protest our Justice system finally started speaking.. Respected Supreme Court , request you to do daily basics hearing on case and 24*7 and make it live .. Save our farmers .. Jai Jawan Jai Kisan."
Bjp govt has sold most of India govt owned facilities
I always like you lallantop nd ndtv .thanks for showing the truth again  unlike godi media shame on other media's like zee news abp news and others
"Hi Abhi, Niyu, you are really doing great work! I believe this video can be an eye opener for farmers, but they might not understand all the terms.. please create this video in simple language understandable by the farmers..."
"Farmer can sell there crop out of mandies , i want to know where they can sell their crops , mean to say door to door and will ask every person , will they buy their crops ( mtlb ghar ghar jaakr loko se puche bhai apne meri fasal leni hai , apne gehu lena hai chawal lena hai ) ....... first bill question arises"
There are four demands of farmers for which this protest is happening
"Why media giving importance to this fellow,as trial,avoid tikait for a week's time."
Indians have little work to do ; so they all do politics!  This talk is also obsessed with political fallout of annulling the farm laws- rather than the long term consequences on Indian agricultures future & modernization of  farming practices. How will Indian agriculture-produce be competitive on global scale ??
If Farmers don't want reforms then don't give any subsidy and other debt benefits from Tax payers hard earn money.
"Why govt is still holding with their lame policy, if farmers don't want it then throw it away"
Keep on protesting majority voters in India are in support of these 3 bills so does not matter how much they protest nothing is gonna happen and if the supporters of this bill come out on road we will outnumber them by 1 to 20
modi said us  Khalistan but he apologize
Tractor rally ko allow hi nhi krna tha 
"Also, Rakesh Tikait in a way is also a hero, leading not just the farmers but entire India from the front. I hope he does not disappoint us later."
"But the thing here is , if anything goes fraud with this contract the farmers can not take the assistance of court."
"I completely object ur analysis,  u may even think hoisting Pakistan flag beside India flag is also correct because they are just 0.01%"
Please make a video with aerial view stretching from the beginning to the end of each highway farmers have blocked. These aerial views are how we can estimate how many ppl are there in total.
"Salute to farmers... beautiful video great teamwork of video making ...sound, aerial shoot, directed and Editing "
Ye sarkar Jo h shi h ya galat lekin future mein agar aisa hi hua tb to 370 v hatega protest k through aur CAA/NRC v hatega protest k through. This is very bad that Government couldn't deliver the bill properly.
"This is only a partial information what you have provided with your expert ,I wish to know how much wheat or rice is being produced annually in India and the farmers who lend their land for these products, what do they charge annually & why they are producing these two products only. If government has come out with one market one nation ,there is a big purpose behind it , which you must learn before showing your intelligence. Even your expert has no knowledge of actual problem which hit's not our earning only but also hampers the progress of country. All governments tried in their periods to bring these law's but we're not in majority to do it. I further add government is not averse to Mandi's & has further earmarked huge funds to modernise these Mandi's & to increase in number where ever it's needed .Now  All other bullshits that corporates will dominate in pricing or will take the land of small farmers, in that regard it's impertinent to mention , contact will be of crop & leasing out land, that's a separate act for that purpose so fear at all of losing land. Now main problem of Government is of buffer crops of both items of wheat & rice produced in India which unmanageable by government & it's agencies that's why I asked to tell me how much of both have been produced in gone year of 2020. To your surprise it was 10,718 lakhs quintials of wheat & 11,417 lakhs quintals of rice , what's the storage capacity required to be for keeping such huge quantity of both. People & opposition parties even told many lies to public about the storage that was got constructed by FCI from Adani Group in late 1990s & 2000to 2010. Even All these storage capacity are negligible in face of what is being produced of both these crops . It's for farmers to produce & sell both commodities but huge difficult for government to carry such stocks for number years where as it's shelf life is few months only & may be extended to a year or so with pesticides & fumigation . Production of wheat is nearly 400% more of what India needs annually & production of rice is more than 200% of need of India & government wishes to change the crop mix only & that will have to be done for the benefits of people of India. We only important adible oil's & further more it can be changed to cash crops which Punjab & Haryana have left in past about 30 year's.If you have any talent now suggest remedy of it rather than misguiding the people without much knowledge of true problem."
It mean pakistan is that much competent to defeat india and USA in Afghanistan? 
"I supported farm Laws form the beginning , perhaps this is the biggest let down for Modi govt ."
I am also kishan .but we with BJP.
I support farmars..shame of politicians...
"Until I saw this video clarifying the Farm laws, I was totally confused as to what this ruckus is about. Thanks Amit uve put it in perspective. But the word selling for profit is not very apt. Can anyone SELL his/her product at less than or the same price at which they have bought ??? or spent to produce. Doesnt the Farmer/Producer add his margin and sell ?? Selling at extraordinarily high ""MARGIN"" is called profiteering, which the essential commodities act is supposed to control. But selling at a profit is what makes the business engine run, at every stage of its transfer of ownership."
"No largely spread misinterpreted information can be cleared in a 10-15 min video. I recommend you all to watch drishti ias's video on farm bills. It talks everything legal , history and present , future , good and bad. Its 3 hours long. But it clears up A to Z everything."
Congrats to all the brave farmers to show the right place of the ruling party.
I am belonging to haryana. I know the situation of farmers in my village.
Some farmers ka nahi balki India whole farmers ka revolution tha modi ji
Thank you for telling their stories. Keep fighting farmers from India 
i kno wire would have got more ppl supported the bill but as usual wire show only those ppl who are against the gov
I support indian farmers protest 
At the same time the fact is that the people are all on the side of the farmers
"They wanted to make violence. Our farmers are sensible and responsible,but misled by anti national elements. Wishing for the farm law problem resolve soon."
Violence has  never been or will be the solution of any protest.. in my opinion what happened today on the Eve of  republic day was very unfortunate and it should be condemned but govt should also understand  policy or bill should not harm any group of people and it can seen from past few years all the amendment and bills brought by the govt has been opposed by various people of the country let say CAA now farm bill ... Govt should look into the this  matter seriously ...happy republic day brothers and sisters.
agreee i hope this issue resolves soon between govt and farmers 
"India needs strong, decisive leadership. Modi is like a 16 year old kid on Instagram, who gets restless if people do not like or admire him. We need serious leadership."
"china, pakistan, congress and ndtv are happy ;-)"
Farmers will be crushed. This government is too powerful. Farmers should tread carefully. I suggest to go back home.
"This is not a farmer's protest but a Khalistani separatist protest (nothing to do with our  nationalist Sikh brothers and sisters) which was earlier nicknamed as ""Referendum 2020"". Almost every Indian farmers are actively welcoming the new farm lays, which will remove the evil middlemen who exploit the farmers and buyers. For eg. Farmers are forced to sell potatoes to middlemen only for 2 per kilo while those same middlemen sell the potatoes to common citizens @  30 per kilo. Shame on you Al Jazeera for supporting terrorists and anarchists."
Shame on yogi and Bjp government....this is Dictatorship  our judiciary is dead  #farmersprotest
Is Modi going to enact national security law against these farmer protests as China ccp did to Hongkong protests?
For Pakistan in the East with India: LOC means Line Of Control...but in the West with Afghanistan: LOC means Line Out of Control!!! 
As a Punjabi-Sikh I cried watching this wholesome coverage by Samdish. Thank you SchoopWhoop for this <3 can't thank you enough.. farmers need these types of platforms to express their views  Love from Punjab.
"What's wrong with bringing a parallel market, why allow APMC have monopoly ? Congress told they would bring the changes in Bill from 1991, but bjp did it. Why opposing now?"
1. Fear regarding MSP ( Minimum Support Price)
Farmers must be given respect and there due rights whether they are living in Pakistan or India because they feed the world
"You  not see what is happening in india  with kashmir .now wait for pak ,taliban army,china and others surprise."
Long live Indian farmers. This is the true Republic Day parade! Modi government should step down in shame!
"Who would have thought Taliban could play Pakistan's playbook so well on Pakistan. After all, they were trained by the same western masters."
"Congratulations to Farmers, country is with them"
Repeal the farm laws and stop catering to billionaire corporations.
Jai jawan Jai kisaan. Totally biased achor. That's called BJP media.
"Panjab and Haryana only protesting farmers because other state farmers don't even know bills, when they come and passed"
Kishan bill right
Is SC sleeping or what. SC had allowed farmers protest. How can they arrest
Arey bhai bill aap liye congress ne nhi liya aapse he sawal puchge na ! Ki congress se puchege ki aapne bola tha reforms layege but aapne laya nhi ? Haad bewakoofi hai !
"Election. Then, these Farmers will"
These are not Farmers protesting.. these are the middle men losing their share .. also supported by opposition and retired and tired politicians who have now admitted they cant beat Modi democratically are trying their ill luck
PUNJAB GONE For congress!
Great leader is p.m. modi ji
"If government had done it 12 month ago, 500 more farmers would be alive "
You did tell us how farmers were affected by the APMC act.. Very nice.. (Yeh to sabhko pata chal gaya hai) 
Wah! Kisan kheti mandir m nhi krta respected anchor
Full support Talban From Pakistan
"This is all for the coming elections. Farmers still don't forget all those hardships, all those people who died due to this, all those people who are brutally murdered by running over vehicle on them. we have to vote that Fraud out and drag every Godi media  to court who tried to defame the farmers, mothers and country. Or else this will never end."
Seriously Modi brought India into hell.
The quint CEO killed 4 farmers in up 
The bill is to benifit the farmers.
Rip farmers
OK with your reasoning for Bihar. But does the less market price led to the change in cropping pattern in Bihar? And does that helped Bihar's farmer monetorly?
Good to have people like you .keep supporting our farmers 
There is no point in making statements based on what happened today. It was the resultant of continued torture and denial of rights the govt imposed on farmers who were protesting for their genuine cause.  Many of today's incidents were created by other malwares. You should be proud that the farmers still managed to conduct their protest and the damages ended by this. I would give full credit to them for conducting it this neat ! Actually I admire them. No other political group could have done this with this much precision. It was  a hard blow on BJP dictatorship 
Farmers Are Soul Of Our Nation They're Poor But They're Not Alone Every Indian Are With Them
Omg that's ALOT of people to feed!! Always got to have Big Business stick their noses in!!!! Hope the Farmers Prevail!
"These farmers are going to starve and she talks about protesting during a pandemic, smh."
Salute to all the kisaan and ravish Kumar for creating havoc in the country. Jai jawaan jai kisaan jai Congress
"So how does that connect to repealing farm laws?  Look, someone was willing to pump in around 50 to 100 million US dollars in this farmers agitation. This is ballpark estimate. You can work out yours."
Honestly explained the truth of farmer's protest  love from Panjab
So the farmers can get a Saficient deal for there hard work.
U r wrong aap and farmers where asking for farm law but the bill.imposed by bjp was black bill there was nothing like farmer will prosper
"Simple Dr Watson. Win win for the BJP. The party (a win with Amrinder, exit from Punjab politics - Congress, AAP and Akali in one swell swoop) in Punjab is more important now. Old wine can be served in new bottles along with the farmers later on. Just saying.. not politics but plain logic."
Delhi Police Leaders should resign for Police Brutality ... Farmers Lives Matter
Just one question..if you were a farmer would you be happy with the bill?
"Please read the articles 15 , 17 and 19 of farmer bill minutely. They are over riding the constitutional articles of similar numbers and it's a violation."
But it is not good for farmers who want to change with time
In reality Pepsi is right about their case against Gujarati farmer they developed a special kind of potato by years of research they have a pattern on the potato seeds you cannot use that I want to go to home which is high and dry contains to sell other than Pepsi and the farmer you are talking about is not a small one he is a rich fellow (200-300 acre property farming) used this potatoes to sell to the other competitive company of the Pepsi to gain a better margin in the product.. this is the reality and no one talks about it(I know this because I am in the same business)
"Shekharji.  You have overlooked the real lesson we have learnt from this unfortunate episode. It is that money raised by vested interests and shared with religious entities can be more powerful than the will  of the people expressed electorally. But for the nexus between the middlemen in Punjab and the Gurdwaras, the financial support could not have mobilized to oppose the laws through protests on the ground.This is a dangerous development and the country should be alerted to this by journalists like you."
person at 7.34 wake up man they are farmers of our country. Delhi people should stand with farmers and should help them in getting their rights. ..
They ignored the initial smoke coming from punjab and paid the price.
"Second law contract farming , suppose they contracted k we have to grow potatoes for 5 year contract , and if the stock get exceeds they will buy it ( agar unhone khaa k humey aalo chahiye aur 5 saal contract krliya aur agar kal ko wo khe k hmaare paas bhaaut aalo ho gye hai humey aur nhi chahiye fr kya krenge itne aaloa ka ? ) ....... and one more thing agar contract torhte hai wo tou farmer cant go to court , they can just go to SDM and as we know how corrupted we are , SDM greeb kisaano ki sunega ya high corporates ki"
Jab Farmers Protest tha...Jab BJP kyu nhi milne aayi...You are Mr Choudhary saab
This is a loss for the real farmers . Modiji did this for the nation because in the name of farmer protest the pro khalistani leader were killing innocent people .Modiji we believe in you and know that you did this for the security of common people . Modiji I support you and I am sure one day the whole country will know the important of farm laws.
Good Analysis Dr. I think soon our great Farmers will have to lead our country. Atleast no one will have to die out in hunger! Farmers our Life Provider!
Farmers should go to election
"Zero number to budget, I am Jagdish Babu Dubey from village Jaitpura tehsil Bharthana District Etawah as farmer, until unless purchaser not come to me to purchase my crops on MSP rate and payment will not come to my bank account directly from the purchaser"
Just ask them what are the contents of farmer's bill against which they are protesting and they will get panic
"The real problem is even bigger than just taking back these new farm laws; the main thing already existing (as said here): large amount of trades between farmers and traders across the country don't ensure Minimum Support Price, thus putting the farmers in never ending debt, leading to thousands of suicides every year! Govt needs to ensure this too !!!!!!!"
"Instead of stopping new farm bill for 18 months let farmers experience new farm bill for 18 months and side by side committee form bring any amendment if needed on the experience of farmers then farmers will release that new farm bill is in there favours .let kotak securities kotak bank open 3 in 1 account of farmers i.e demat, trading, bank account, also teach farmers how to export  agro products of export quality skill development under kotak bank global trade account for exporters small marginal big farmers all over India .farmers will have 2nd line of income support .while getting benefit of 2nd line of income they can provide food grains of good quality"
Why Panjab and Hariyana farmers protesting ? Ans: This states farmers enjoining 95% of MSP.
If Modi wins election from  now on toe laaanat hai  tum sab pr bjp hataaav desh bachav
"US doing two face work , at the same time they are helping pakistan to help taliban and on the other side they are helping afghan forces . its so confusing? When this will end . if u cant bring peace in my country than dont help our enemies too . so our own force can bring peace."
That Farmer Aka khalisthani was Dead Bcz He clashed his tractor with Barricade
It's disappointing that the reformist law's have been repealed.Hope this are implemented in at least Bjp ruled states.
I love Indian farmers!
Salute to each and every individual of this country who has stands with our farmers for their solidarity agitation
"Report put more emphasis on journalists, instead of farmers, reports are trained to do so,  shame on media, they dont say anything about police, army, all are getting paid to do soooooo"
"Huh... So you remember when Modi was praised as fighting for the people of India, like Trump? Lol"
"I think, FSP is a great suggestion and should be added to the farm bill."
Very beautiful and nice humanity in farmers. Kisan ekta jindabad.
Rakesh tikait you are really a fit person to answer godi media.
Another clip to watch in support our Kisaan Punjab Farmers protest in London https://youtu.be/ZFCyQMbFZBc
Now diversify msp procurement from all states in equal ratio...not keep them specific to punjab haryana up
Because we have example of ITC which procures directly from farmers
Himmat hai modi ji ki.... So much patience... The quality of a Holy man.. Respect u
I am actually supportive of the move. Reforms can only happen if BJP remains in power and farmers are a big vote base.
"This asininely statement that farmers opposition is pointless is also illogical. Because the farmers are the aggrieved party which was never consulted before drafting the laws. Does Modi government knows better than the farmers interests better than the farmers themselves? MODI IS EXPLOITING THE MAJORITY BY CHURNING OUT LAWS WITHOUT MUCH THOUGHT AND DEBATES. EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT DEMONETISATION, GST AND OTHER HALF COOKED DISASTERS."
Rakesh tikket is criminal shame he represents farmers
Godi media not showing this interview on television because this channel is aaj tak digital only for social media
"So basically you are worried about Monopoly in this sector, well we already have laws for that. If a corporation starts exploiting of the farmers or consumers then both will shift to another company. Market competition needs to be maintained and that is where govt steps in. Ask yourself, why is internet in India so cheap?? It's because of market competition, and buddy it works wonders."

Farmers need to store their commodity for atleast two months
Even I was supporting our farmers but for the cause....not for this act....shameful....bus Ka tractor se hatana...woh bhi Jo govt ke subsidy se Mila hai
And farmer help us to live.....
"The issue is not just related to MSP. It is something deeply rooted in what economists have been debating for more than 2 decades. Most of the Indian farmers own 2 acres or less agricultural land. There is no way you can improve the standard of living for these farmers if they work on farm alone. The MSP system coupled with the food subsidies help these farmers just survive nothing more. Economists want Indian government to push these low acreage farmers out of farms and work into manufacturing and services sectors be it as a labourer in the upcoming factories being moved from China. It hard to say who is being adamant here, these farmers with a very low farm holding who will never be able to improve their standard of living with farming or the government that thinks moving them out of the farm will somehow accelerate the pace of manufacturing in India. This is a problem where no one is wrong eventually and no one is right."
Pressuring the government to make a statement that can cost lives of hundreds of our soldiers is un ethical for the media. Best option for India here would be to wait and watch for as the things unfold
Bjp isnow so good at ignoring problems in the country that they don't even see farmers walking on the street.
"Guy's they are not a farmer's are they are just a political game in this game the innocent public are getting hard jago chutiya public modi ji ki jay modi ha tho moumkin ha you ful hopeless public kab jagoga sab app logo ka dam pa kar raha ha sarkar tho da rahi ha lakin ya chor sala sab kha latha ha jagoo fir sa bol rahahu jago public or bhi kisaan ha is desh may aram sa  ha jago,jay hind jay bharat"
While Rihanna speaking up on Farmer's protest is Internal matter
Ok modi will ask mafi for kisaan will the opposition will ask mafi for khalistani
Salute to farmers no farmer no food
Long live the farmers will win this war  don't give up hope entire world is with the farmers 
I don't see any female farmer protesting. Feminism?
Farmers died and cars were burnt. What is more important? Human lives or car ?
Stupid decision.. India's dream of reforming it's agriculture has failed ab yahi kisan sadko par ayenge! Aur kahinge ki hamara karz maaf kar do! Taxpayers kr paise se farmers ko subsidy di jayegi! Welcome back to Nehruvian Socialism!
Repeal the 3 farm law and make new laws with consensus with farmers and other related specialists .
But farmers should be also free selling to anyone they want.
Isme benifit kuch nhi hai yaha farmers msp me apna saman sale karenge aur dusre hath local market me prices apne aap increase ho jaegya... This is inflation... Vegetable sellers will be rich by the day... By making fake stories like they use to tell...
Good reply of Rakesh Tiket ji. Kisan unity Zindabad
We all South Indian farmers will sit on agitation now to bring back those laws..
"India is a very complex system where the middle class enjoy cheap food prices and farmers receive low prices for their crop as they currently are not allowed to store crop, pay high prices for inputs and don't have the ability to protect themselves with futures contracts. The current system in India is not sufficient to support all the small farmers in India (they lack the scale to produce, store and market their own products). A free market can only work, which these bills seek to do, if both buyers and sellers have equal bargaining power. Smaller farmers are not only lacking the skill but also the knowledge to effective participate in a free market. They free they will be crushed under low prices. The government should offer assistance and compensate for farmers harmed by these laws until the economy normalized. India need to grow beyond having millions of small farmers and the farmers need to accept their faith but I think the government did not do a good job in marketing these bills. Also, the people of Punjab are well off farmers compared to rest of India. If you look at the number of children being sent outside from Punjab to study in college, you would understand why punjabis are at the heart of the protest. They enjoy the highest income in the country from farming. Any threat to their lifestyle would bring about a reaction. Many of those protesting have on name brand clothes, Nike, Adidas, and drive Audis. These aren't the lowly farmers of Bihar."
So gov compromised for few states. Disregarding rest of states.. in from south and i am a farmer. This is really sad. We were happy that there will be reforms . . politics failed farmers again.
Reforms are necessary in agrarian sector but it should be beneficial to the farmers.
Shame on government for not able to resolve farmers concerns even after 2-3 months
"And the farmers cannot lose their land as under the new law, the land of the farmer can neither be sold, leased or used for any purpose other than those related to agricultural trade activities. "
Against the farm bill
"Lastly MSP: You the reader needs to understand that it should be the minimum base price that the farmer should get not the maximum. And even if you don't like MSP atleast ask your MLA that why products bought under MSP prices ,the savings aren't passed on to you. Maybe we need a MSP proce on each product instead Of MRP to show how much the traders are making on these goods. "
I support to farmers 
We farmers just want obligatory right from Govt.not compulsion if any
"If the Laws are repealed,  Modi Govt will learn its lesson that the Indian Constitution and India's Federal structure cannot be kicked out of the window. We are NOT OPEN to fascism and anarchy and single party system and dictatorship ... not necessarily in that order."
"Im against this law as it exploits the farmers . The contract farming  is something farmers feared as it give open permission to udyogpatis to exploit farmers and removing MSP will bring our farmers below poverty line which could be disastrous and can lead to famines and depletion of economic liberalism and turning indian economy into capitalist economy whic can be pretty fatal for our country  . Jai kisan , kisan ekta zindabad"
Jab phati.tab yaad aaya. This is the power of farmers. 
We proud on Haryana Punjab Brothers
This kind of farmers are the curse for the country and defaming real farmers
"Being from farmers background and currently a practicing lawyer, I can definitely say that these farm bills have the power to revolutionize the entire farming industry. It will definitely be helpful in advancing the farming industry. We should have open mindset towards these bills."
I feel ashamed by watching our farmers condition
If people have minimum wage. Should not the farmers have a fair minimum price for his or her produces? The farmers had to buy seeds and chemicals plus paid rent for the land in order to produce his harvest to sell. 
Your statement at 1.03 that farmers can sell his produce only at APMC in his area is wrong.
We support farmers.
"Again I think disputes are really hard to win for the farmers incase of any misadventures from these companies, unless atleast the poor farmers are given unconditional protection from exploitation in any court and at least be able to get back their expences for the loss due to the misunderstanding from the clauses, hoping the educated farmers are at least aware of the contract and what they are signing into."
"I got goosebumps everytime when I see my brothers, sisters,uncles and aunts at Delhi border fighting for our future am so thankful to scoop whoop for these kind of videos.  #nofarmernofood #farmerisgod"
Shameless Congress party leaders are to be blamed for giving these Khalistanis free hand
Sikhs no longer stand at borders for India as you though but now you all know they stand at borders to protect Punjab but if anyone gets past Delhi it's Indias own problem no Khalistan problem. The foreign investment for Khalistan shall be the n ira billions as we have taken over the block chain and creating cryptos that will keep all banks and invaders at bay. We are too smart for the world...just ask Britain government how very clever Sikhs. We build our wealth and now have the deepest pockets to take over economies and close them down 
Sorry to say but you have no knowledge about farmer bills. Have you ever visited a mandi . Have you ever been at an auction at a mandi.Its not about congress its about us farmers.
Only two state farmers
And why only Punjabi farmers from whole lot of Indian farmers protesting??
"Farmers are the worthy sons of Idia, their grievance is a worth to be consider"
Literally such a set back..we want some improvement in these laws but entire repeal must not be done..
"Already several other companies are doing contract farming in india. Pls enquire wth other food companies. It is good for farmers, if more companies are coming to buy their crops, so that there will be more demand. "
Stand with farmers of India
"1. MSP (Minimum Support Price) is not applied everywhere (that is why these protests are mainly by farmers from Punjab, Haryana and western U.P.) and is given to only 23 crops of which the govt. only has a guaranteed buy scheme for two crops, i.e. rice and wheat. This means that no matter how much rice and wheat is brought in the APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committee), the govt. gives a guarantee that it will buy all of it. "
"Highly appreciate your work. Thank you for giving clarity about this. Otherwise, Godi media has gone to next level."
India also not declared pakistan a terrorist state it doesn't mean that they are not. Sometimes geopolitics plays a role. If we can't declare taliban as a terrorist organisation it should be not taken as we like there policies.
Hon'ble PM: No Agricultural Law will be back. It is in Favour of Farmers.
After great U-turn from Modiji.....reminded me of Gandhiji's famous U turn in Non-Cooperation movement.....Great Modiji....
thankyou ma'am its really clear all doubts on farm bill. waiting foe more videos like this...
"""The farmer is the only man in our economy who buys everything at retail, sells everything at wholesale, and pays the freight both ways.JFK"

"Rihanna did it well. Thank you. Indian ""Sale'braties"" were in great sleep. The Supreme Court also working for Government. Media personnel who are showing the truth got detained under serious act. of law."
Such short-sighted policies will destroy Modi's credibility and knock the bottom out of BJP's vision of the country's future. Surrender to hooliganism is the surest recipe for the country's downfall.
 Farmers protest in this case.
"Our support to students community for supporting   our Indian Farmer's. Three cheers for students. Community.  Jai Kissan Jai Jawan, Kissan brother's Zindabad"

"The one who eat food, will definitely support farmer."
Now farm bills - defeat
#Nofarmers 
Government should repeal farm laws immediately. 
It surely is a win for the rich so called farmers who in turn fund political parties
Power to farmers of India . Love from Nepal .
"Okay so basically I support modi and i dont need to give you a reason , cuz its just politics yk"
Request with everyone pls support these farmers. I m from Patna Bihar
Thanks to BBC for coverage of farmers protest.  Now all know why people are in Delhi for suspension of farmer bills they are not terrorist.  Govt is trying to turn the agenda nd not fulfilling the demands of people of India.  Its not democracy its dictatorship.
In case of dispute btwn big corporates ans farmers over any issue farmer cant go to court directly and the issue will be solved by magistrate only who act according to even a local mla 
Farmers are real heroes. They will show what power is.
"The one dead farmer killed himself by driving the tractor at high speed into a barricade and the tractor toppling on top of him. What your headline seemed to miss was the numbers of Indian police men and women who died as a result of the protestors actions. The protesters were protesting against the addition of an option to sell their crops by themselves, without middlemen eating into their profits. This riot was backed by non-else than Greta Thunberg who was involved in producing and releasing a google toolkit outlining the incidents on these dates, inciting these people to do what they did! Environmental Greta backed those who destroy Indias environment by stubble burning, use pesticides prolifically making that area the cancer capital of India and whose indiscriminate use of fertiliser has polluted the water table. Well done Greta!"
They are not farmer they are Congress B team
"1. He keeps saying jat politics in Western UP, jat leaders and their stand on farmers agitation etc. This kind of language divides and presents jat community as one against all others ( or farm laws). Jats are divided on farm laws ( I am being from this community. I live in the US. I stay in regular communication  with my family members and friends. I find strong sentiments on both sides of the issue. Please SGji don't present farm laws as jat community issue. It is farmers issue and India issue. You come across as if you have biases when you keep saying jat community this or that ( perhaps unintentional). Please don't generalize."
"This debate should go to SC. Let SC announce an expert committee. Let the farm laws be reviewed by all farm unions, across India & other stakeholders, within 6 months. "
other farmers of others parts of india are not having any problem with these farm laws  execept  punjab and haryana
"The most important element in a news is truth,supported by right facts,which generally 99% of news channels are lacking today.I feel more mentally safer and truly awared of happenings in the country on watching his videos than news channels."
Govt. Should strengthen APMCs so that every farmer get the benefit. Otherwise it will remain as a political gimmick.
Shame on the Indian police throwing stones and beating peacefully protesting farmera
"But currently our politicians are extreme corrupt. they increase their salaries at any time in parliament but don't want increase income of farmers. They got fund from corporate, then why govt or politician think about of farmers income growth."
Many tractors no registration plate. Carring weapons.kalistani flag. 40 lakh worth modified tractor was seen. Rich people
It is a very wrong decision. It shows that the government is weak and lacks the willpower to go through reforms.80% farmers who were supportive of these laws have nowhere to go now.It shows how hooliganism has won.Its distressing. Nobody has won but Nation has lost a big opportunity.
What do u mean by withdrawing support from bill? Withdraw support to government.
farmers are of father of national ......
Thank you so much guys  for stand with farmer 
"You don't respect the farmer, the nation will be cursed. Let them not eat food, tell them to eat money, material, or dung."
"1) A farmer cannot go to the court when there is a conflict between a trader and a farmer. Don't you see it as a problem, given the extent of corruption in India, SDMs can be easily bought by bigger corps/government?"
Entire country should support farmers .. bjp government is a coward and not even want to face farmers ..
Amending APMC ( Agricultural Produce Market Committee ) Act doest mean These Black Farm Laws.... AAP never Said It WIll Bring These Kind of Laws...  Doont Misguide People For Views And Money.
"The above concept is quite interesting where the govt need to understand this demand  rather than keeping away themselves from the farmer , as they believe that they opened the channel for the meet between farmer and buyer.."
"Your wording ""few lives lost"" is humiliating to the farmers.Around 900 farmers lost their lives and for you it is ""few lives"". What sort of reporting is this?"
Guys support farmers they are our back bone 
"Rich people in our comfortable homes: I support hard-working farmers' protests against injustice after injustice, but... (moral high ground speech against violence)"
"*(Isliye godi media anchors ko public like nahi karti,tumhari news thik nhi hai... today what happened with  chitra  tripathi )*"
I don't understand that point why farmers sell it to the middle man when MSP is higher than the market rate. I understand that only a few people get to sell through MSP because of the storage issue but I don't understand the other reason why they take those products to the market when the MSP is higher than the market rate.I assume that farmers don't have a clear idea of the rates that is prevailing?
Traders when have to buy will buy from plaes where its available at cheaper prices be ti from other  countries and our farmers will suffer when traders dont buy from them . Think of the chines products that have infested indian stores in all sextors bcause of the congress free trade policy by great MMS when he was the FM in 1991. 
when history will written in future .. godi media would be most darkest spot on that
Good I suprort farmer
"Shekhar Gupta casually compares Alaudin Khilji's price control to MSP, while at the same breath explaining how it was the maximum price set for soldiers (not minimum). This approach lacks intellectual rigour.  You can draw baseless comparisons of every economic and social policy with some practice that occurred centuries ago.  Most of Indian laws, policies and acts are based on something or the other introduced by the British. This does not necessarily undermine the contemporary relevance of any law or Act nor does it make it particularly special. What Shekhar Gupta should question is why is the Centre adamant on implementing these Acts even when the states have shown that they can easily reform it to suit their own situation (which he seems to be using as his primary argument)."
Stop calling them FARMERS !! IT'S A POLITICAL GIMMICK  .. NOTHING MORE
The law was good. they should've not repealed them. it's a loss for farmers.
Why India is not showing their intentions to fight the terrorist...
Now big question is why farmer's are becoming poorer it's because their input cost is high compare to output (intensity ratio is high). Ideally that needs to be corrected by establishing channel to provide low cost farming. 
Thanks modiji you just earned by vote
Very well explained the government should leave optional to enter into a agreement this way farmer can choose his land he can fix the price

"It's a peaceful protest, Mr. Justin Trudeau people of HK need your support & voice more than Indian Farmers.... Act mature."
"Let consider reliance (remember jio bulldozer marketing tactics) company buy all future rice bags at a fair price from farmers in India  ,  which is not yet to seeded. Which create artificial scarcity in future using it he keep higher prices than MSP which led to chaos in buyer and where let to a shortage in government state-run reaction stores poor people can't eat their meals."
What I have never heard or read about these farms laws is how many farmers were opposing and how many supported it? There was no proper statistics and mostly saw centrist or leftist channels promoting agitation. If these laws were so popular then why there were no support rallies or cry now from farmers who were in favor of these laws? Also if more farmers were supporting it then Modi just gave them big slap on their face!
"Feels like farmers are not yet ready to make farming like an industry. If I get good price elsewhere why I may not like to sell there? Well it is related to quality of product. If quality is bit bad, I can sell in mandi, MSP is already there as was before, if good I may sell elsewhere in high price. Protest is highly motivated by politics and middlemen."
"Third law simply allows private players to store farm produces, which was not allowed as india was deficient in food production and govt feared hoarding. Now India has so much food grain production that it can't consume what it produces."
The best thing in this protest Haryana wale & punjab wale unite together .this is our culture we live together & stay together jai jawan jai kisan
"Talking about Modi Ji's Govt, then this is the govt who had looked into all matters."
"You explained the situation in case of Punjab and Haryana farmers but overlooked the other wheat and rice growing states and the quality of these crops which Govt has to procure is not exportable too. Good video but it overlooks so many other points which we can not overlook if farmer's and farming conditions in India has to improve. Farmer's health, use of chemicals in farming, day by day depleting and polluting water table and farmers growing only few types of crops which brings less price because all are growing same crops. Plz make another video keeping in mind all those aspects too."
"Primary reason is security concerns. Pakistan's ISI taking advantage of the unrest & disquiet caused by Farmers protests, reignited the fire of Khalistanis and offered tie up with Islamist extremist groups in India and abroad. All this was creating security concerns, hence withdrawal of farm laws is a small price."
"Just trash the bills and start working with the farmers ! Why is the Govt so focused in imposing those bills? When the farmers are protesting and saying they don't need it??  Those bills were not discussed properly and were made as law. What nonsense was that ? That's the same happening with every BJP reform which is destroying country""s economy & unity. And after the poor farmers started agitation now the Govt is suggesting ammendmends to the bills. So where is the trust and what were the Govt motives  imposing those bills in the first place?? Just trash those bills first and then talk. Why is the Govt not putting on the listening ears ? This govt is supposed to be for the people right ? I guess its not yet dictatorship here  TRASH the BILLS !!"
It's more like Sikhs vs Govt riots..... Not farmers riots anymore......
No farmers No food 
We say a big No to the Ambanisation of agriculture. We all stand in solidarity with our farmers.
What about 3 billon dollors spent by indian govt in afganistan
We are grateful to have you as a journalist...voice of people..... Unlike godi media
Congrats farmers. 
"Chuslami media, don't show very big issues like (Kishan Bharwad )who killed by islamist over a post, don't u people have any morality."
India goes to the hell after taliban government hahahahaha 
Modi ji has failed once again on farmers and Sikkim village of India occupied by Chinese PLA
Farmers have been protesting peacefully for 2-3 months and most of them still are. But minority did get violent however what hasn't been showed is how the police was beating up some protesters who were causing no trouble at all. Some even speculate that these riots were planned by the government to put farmers in the bad light but no one really knows. Farmers have been protesting to have the newly introduced bills back.
Why does he not cover middle men and the supply chain resulting in the loss of income for farmers? The middle has won more than the farmers.
This acts are more favorable towards the company and not legally empower the farmers.
"Punjab farmers had done a wonderful job in the initial years of the Green Revolution but gradually , massive subsidies , no income tax and MSP, free electricity , wrong entries of Khud Kasht- Actual Tiller status in Revenue records by corrupt Patwaris etc ,.turned these once hard working farmers into super middleman and brokers for small farmers / Artiyas - a sort capitalist -absentee land lordship exploitative form of functioning . . New farm laws gave small farmers to an opportunity become independent ."
"Nonviolent agitation is all good. It might not affect the general Modi support. But SG points correctly, in no way, the protest for/of Farmers against the laws should take shape of an agitation for Identity  among the Sikhs of Punjab."
"Nicely explained except for one thing that you missed. If the PVT companies are not paying the farmer for what they have agreed on, the farmer shall get lower price, you said. But in this case the farmers can still sell the product in Mandi on MSP, you missed."
"Maybe there are a few issues with the laws, but you can't outright ask to withdraw the laws that can potentially help millions of other farmers in the country. Punjab/Haryana farmers have already been benefitting for many years... you need to let others also prosper.. A federal govt has to look after the benefits of farmers in the entire country, not just one region... Think logically.. not emotionally..!"
This is one of the best videos I have seen about farm bills.
"Rakesh ji Dehli riots, UP riots, CAA, NRC, Minorities rights, Mob lynching ke ke baare me boliye phir chacha-bhatija kijiye. Hum aap ko support krenge."
"Wow after how many farmer died , they called khalistani , minister son run over a car on farmer , Same he did on Notebandi , only election matter for him ."
Farmers power
humble request to farmers to stop all protests...
Proud of being farmer proud of being sardar
Government and godi media dono hare hai.... 
But i bow to modiji for his humbleness despite the strength that he possesses
"So clearly explained, current farmer issue is specific & should be termed as Punjab Farmer issue"
"b) wasn't contract farming already allowed in agriculture before the bills? if yes, how is this different?"
These laws would have benefitted 95% of farmers in India. These rich farmers in Punjab and middlemen for their selfish motives scuttled this reform.
Discussion  between  Govt and the farmers is the only  way.... Vandalism  is no way... Discuss  and understanding  of the bill and regarding  MSP already  it is there.. So more amount  of freedom  has been given to the farmers against  the middlemen who are actually  looting  the hard work of the farmers ...Discussion  and proper understanding  between  the farmers  and the Govt is the way out for better  tomorrow  for the farmers...
"Going by your own logic india should also should declare itself a Hindu nation and verbally mention we will take care of all minorities like Taliban, Pakistan and Bangladesh. We all know then how do they take care. Why leftists eyes have closed their eyes on what happened to minorities in this countries although they were part of india at some point. The only difference between india and these countries is that Islam is in majority in these nations. If Indian Muslims really celebrate Taliban victory, do you think their thought process is any different. Why don't you blame their Dharmik chashma because your chashma doesn't see it."
Most important is our country development! Our Farmers should support with Center Government with best proposal for their betterment as well of our India! Jai Hind!
"Today Taliban in control of Afghanistan because India was using Afghan soil against Pakistan, so Pakistan had no other option but aiding Taliban. So India is responsible for this mess."

This poorr farmer drinks cofee in 5 star hotel only
No words to say about your contribution in farmer's protest by writing beautiful lyrics and singing these songs...
"Modi ji were also calling kishan khalistani,  terrorist. Anti national,  even killed the farmer,  you can not believe this govt"
I support taliban..... Yogi teri himmat he...
"How come the manifesto of all major political parties had the somewhat same kind of farm reform laws in even 2019. I guess, different government committees in past 20 years studied this matter and also suggested about farms reform. Even Rakesh Tikait at first praised the reform and later dissociated from it. In fact, Print reported that Kaushik Basu also had same kind of suggestion to congress but when the laws came through NDA he started to come up with different problems in this law. Definitely, the failure of demonetization made PM weak as he cant say now that whatever decision he takes will reap good.  So, he failed to push hard for these reforms as the credibility already questioned on one major reform i.e. notebandi."
"Reason they lost this battle is because they stared riots with Anti Hindu slogans, if they stick to farmers slogan all Indians would support them"
"4. Sir, i am not well aware of Farm laws. Yes, i believe that MSP may increase food subsidy. But indirect removal of MSP through Farm laws is not in the interest of farmers future. Government did not included MSP in farm laws. He only ensure guaranteed price which is governed by private trader and farmer. And we well aware the farmers were not afford negotiations with such big players. Government says, MSP is administrative matter not a legesative. In my opinion government must ensure MSP to the farmers in written form for safeguarding the interest of farmers. "
"India can only send resources to help Afghanistan,  they know if they send Army they all will die.  Thats the taliban power. Then all will say Lund Hind"
"Ok by putting up the Khalsa flag, u have made what was intended to be solely an economic issue of farmers into a communal and religious issue, which makes no sense at all!  U are just fueling that who khalistani bs which everyone knows will never happen. That too u did that on a secular monument!"
I have lost all sympathy for the farmers now. Only Law can give justice to Lakhbeer Singh.
"accept Muslims in your Country, busy talking about Talibans while u discriminate Muslims in your Country"
"Such an excellent interview, NL team ! What a grounded, wise man is Rakesh Tikait!"
Atal ji got voted out of power and congress bled India almost to death after that. Does aim think this is china? At any cost we need BJP back dont we. Theres literally no hope for india without that.
"If farmers have 1 month memory, they will vote for BJP. If farmers have 3 years memory, they wil vote for any other party. BJP completely lost the plot. Disgrace"
We r with farmers
Congress zero seats next election
I think govt should modified the bill properly. It have so many loop holes.
Media: indian farmers protest
Well done karan.. ! Really appreciated for supporting farmers..!
"There are so many reforms, bills, pensions, loan waivers, apps for the farmers but what they don't have is awareness about them."
Yaa I totally agree with you and I raise a question that this is a farmer protest not a Hindus or Muslims protest brother Muslim aur Hindu can be a farmer  and allowed to do protest maybe I am wrong so please correct me for this
Would be better this congress goes to mone vart rest of the life. Its the best thing this haramkhor can do for people of india 
In 2014 god make me pm to help farmers comedy of the year
Thanks for talking about farmers 
"It's not Kisaan Andolan.. It's sign of One more possible partition of India. Khalistan... Govt. Of India should strictly take actions against these activities. It's crime against Nation, Security and Integrity of India. Farmer engage in his work not in Such activities. This movement is run by Nakli Kisaan"
God bless all those fighting for their rights and huge respect this is the land of farmers !!
I would like to request india government to support Panchsher warriors in afghanistan
"The reforms will also sound death of the rural development in Punjab and Haryana, which is sustained on market fee and rural development cess. Punjabs annual income from these sources is about 4000 crores and it is used to fund rural infrastructure, particularly 5000 Kms of village link roads, agricultural research, storage godowns etc. The new laws do not provide an alternate source of revenue for the loss of this income as these take away the power of states to impose any fee or cess, by whatever name called."
"Other than serving the needs of large corporations, does anyone else actually significantly benefit from these new laws, such that it's worth thousands of farmers losing their livelihoods?"
"PM Modiji is a survivor, not your rigid, inflexible idealist."
I am a son of a farmer in Punjab. Ilove my India like all the farmers. These news channel will not say anything wrong about govrenment. If you wanna see rality you can watch NDTV India or you see Dhruv Rathi s latest video. Please dont judge farmers protest according to these fake news. Please
The same as in Europe ... NO FARMERS = NO FOOD
The middlemen - Imagine a scenarion where a poor farmer goes to a mandi along with his produce to get the returns for his hardwork. He bares the transportation cost as well. But the middlemen grades his produce as low quality and defective..and buys it at a negligible cost. The return that the farmer got was lesser than the amount he invested to grow the produce and the transportation charges. What are the chances of this actually happening to farmers of this country?
1:03 Farmers have complained about them and have demanded reforms. Which are those changes demanded by farmers? Since when? Why haven't they happened already. No comment
Alll credit goes to our farmers 
"All tukde tukde gang. Its not farmer protest but just political rally in the garb of farmer protest. Its shame on the Tikait and his gang. They stoop to any low just to target Modi or Yogi Ji. UP should kick out Mulayam, Akhilesh and all the dynasties. And embrace Yogi Ji!"
Farmers may have some genuine concerns but these bill have been discussed over 17 years. 
I dont know why but media got hurt to see farmers win. Can see all reportrs in pain and vain expressns hahaha

We should support farm law
Who will take the responsibility & accountability  of 600+ Deaths Farmers
Why don't the Kisan Leaders start co-operative forums for marketing of farm produce to avoid middleman and get fair prices. Amul is the best example in this regard.
Now the time has come for Pakistan and taliban.  Let's wait and see how they play their games
"Abhay Dubey is right, RSS will trying to support BJP in UP election, that is why they jumped in Kisan Andolan again."
"Govt, at least now, could move on and focus on other sectors for economic growth.. Probably, a watered down version of this farm laws could be enacted in BJP ruled states or center might enact laws to strengthen and bring transparency to existing setup."
What full video? Where is the jeep running over aged farmers from behind ?
Respect all Farmer #Nofarmer#Nofood
BJP is moving day by day on naazi's footprint and impress with his ideology....  sham on modi backing this ideology
'They're Trying to Wipe Us Off the Map.' Small American Farmers Are Nearing Extinction.
"This is indeed a shashtanga Namaskar by Modi that was totally uncalled for...this is just political expediency masquerading as 'National Interest' coming as it does now and not on January 26th when our Tricolor was abused at Redfort ...If Anti Nationals and anti-social elements are trying to hijack the farmer's protest, the solution is to tackle it head on with all the might of the nation...Is India so powerless that it cannot enforce what was passed in the parliament?...or is it the spinelessness of the Modi government that has always allowed issues to go out of hand (Shahin bagh ,NRC/CAA, Land Reforms) rather than nip it in the bud by addressing it with proper articulation and dissemination of its programs ...Modi is letting down  people who placed their trust and hope in voting the BJP with a huge mandate...He cannot now expect a repeat of it unless he shows some mettle in walking the talk."
Guys don't worry that's new normal in new India under the gundagardi of our beloved modi ji and bjp.
Main reason for taking back these laws is inability to convince benefits to real farmers or we can say lousy attitude of real farmers to let these bogus agitators represent them
"Crazy it is now , it's really sad to see farmers protest is being destroyed,"
"why dont you correct your caption and say ""the sikh farmers are being targeted left right and center, we know the truth, this is 2020, god bless Cell phones!!"
1000% agreed abt mrp for farmers 
So happy that the farmers won and gave a big middle finger to the government.
He never spoke on farmers in period before today. Print is no rebel independent media instead it is a digital extension of godi media.
If govt has passed this bill to give benefits to the farmers. If in case in future somewhere if farmers incurred some loss due to this bills then govt duty to change as per the need. It is not compulsory that only bjp has to do it. It has to be done by the party who is in power. All time opposing is not the solution it will always keep us backward.
"Thank you farmers for showing millennials, on Internet they can only Troll, real results can be brought on ground with real efforts."
"Truly they were not hindu muslim sikh they were farmers,the last time British United Indians the same way ."
"Modi wants Bharat to be a Hindu Estate: So let it be. Let Khalistan come into being, let Kashmir come into being , let Asam come into being; and let Nagaland come into being: What is left over is Modi's Hindu Veresh: Enjoy. What is the problem with that. Modi is a Pakistani Agent: He has more sympathy with the late mother of Nawaz Sharif than those 140 Farmers died because of the severe weather sitting in the Andolan. Shame of this type of treatment. Farmers are Andata, they are not Atanwad: But Modi has treated them as terrorist. Modi must be removed from the power and must be trialed to get a sentence of death or let Bharat be divided into 5 parts. That is the end of this RSS Terrorist hijacked Bharat and created a situation of hatred and marginalization: against the policies of Nahro, and Ghandi. This is the start of the movement of Khalistan. Now it is out of control. Jai Kisan; Jai Jawan: Jai Khalistan: is what I have been hearing from the participents of this rally."
" I am also the son of a farmer, so this pain is our own, if the farmer is not happy then it will be difficult to feed the whole world, first he committed many suicides, some debts were buried, he appealed to the state government  Oppose the decisions and understand the pain of their farmers and speak for their rights.  The media should also emphasize this.  Most of the farmers make a living by cultivating on a small plot of land, do not deprive them of their rights and oppose the decision of the government and so I request everyone that this uf"
Maashaallah.if farmers can make their own godown and sell it will be a revolutionary movement historical Move in the agricultural sector.Allah make it easy for all farmers inshaallah aameen
Congrats to farmers and sikh brothers from kashmir 
Prime minister repealed three farms laws  while wearing Pashmina Shawl and Khaadi ......Come on Dude 
Full Mark's to India today for trying to save BJP
"Police given permits to this Rally, then why police attacked the farmers, it is shame."
There can be flaws in the current bill that the government has passed but I see this as a very necessary and effective step Indian government has taken and in the long run will help farmers to earn way more money then they are earning right now...
What's the guarantee the corporates won't end up exploiting the farmer...?
Is ON in the revised name of farmers.
We always support our God Farmer
"Any legislation to be introduced in Parliament after consultation with the stake-holders. In this case, farmers were not consulted and didnot take farmers into confidence. Any concern(s) from stake-holders must be taken into consultation before drafting the legislation, which was not done in this case, which is wrong in democracy. This is not a radical reform but a high handedness of Modi Govt."
"The new farm laws will not only affect the farmers but also us, the citizens who rely on the farm products directly or indirectly. Changes to uplift the agriculture and farmers lifestyle is definitely required. But it must also involve understanding their issues at the ground level and working on the solutions around it. A small inconvenience in our life to uplift our farmers lives is the least we could take."
Indians we americans loves you stay safe :D No more fightt between Hindus and Muslims We love u all :D
"What ever bjp said before, non of assurance implemented. Instead of that petroleum products, domestic gas prices  are increased to four folds."
"This is a victory to Socialist Secular India.!! No to privatization, No to Corporations, No to Modi!!"
"Ha, Corporatization of agriculture mai farmer ko exploit kiya jaa sakta h."
"The explanation is so unbiased that those who are pro-government, belive the bill is good for farmers and those who are anti understand why the bill is bad for farmers. It also says that the bill has it share of both good and bad, and a proper discussion would make it lot better for every party involved."
"This, in fact, is the fundamental difference between the new laws and the existing laws of most of the states that already permit private markets to operate. Some states also allow contract farming, and virtually no state bans its farmers from selling anywhere in India. But a false narrative has been created that the new reforms create one nation one market, as if it did not exist before. Punjab farmers have been selling crops like Kinnow, potato, cotton etc all over India, just as Bihar sends truck-loads of Paddy to Punjab and Haryana because its APMCs were abolished in 2006 and private markets are not remunerative."
Yep in south Gujrat Amreli farmer use solar and get free power and other all useless power give electric company and they pay 70000 per year my some relatives are doing this
"This is not real picture, in farmers protest had many gunde, andh bhkt, violence maker, rules breakers, who spread violence in Delhi, or  logo Ko yh lgra h ki farmers violence kr rhe h "
But the actual point is nobody force any farmer to make a contract outside mandi market.
"No chance for Celebrations,  now Opposition parties have to get answers for their vehement opposition to farm laws, to silent majority farmers who were busy in their farms, couldn't manage to come on to roads in support of farm laws. This is a master stroke by Modi sir, still not understood by Rahul and likes of him."
Congratulations to all the farmers who risked their lives to fight for what was right
I also see as Govt acting tough now on agitators as farmer cause cover is removed
"Nice presentation on APMC TAXATION but mam kya protest sirf Punjab ke kisan ker rhe no body else ....gujrat ke pass apne source hai taxes ke ,MH ke pass apne ....Punjab ke pass or kya hai fertile  land ke sivaye .....I believe ki gov APMC ki condition sudhare mai kaam kre to wo in reforms se jyada better hoga"
.................. Will be back soon for the betterment of farmer's rights 
"Trial the reforms in a few regions first, realise the benefits and prove to the rest the merits of the reforms (if any).  Use the excess grain for the livestock industry and increase meat production.  Concerns of the farmers must be addressed as no reforms will work without their support.  Start distributing free face masks to the protestors and villagers.  Look into providing low interest loans, the costs of agricultural inputs and export markets for agricultural products. Best wishes to India and in memory of my classmate Gurbachan Singh"
" they are so powerful, they made USA led alliance a joke and lesson for other countries threatening taliban , India should watch it's media and step back they don't forgive their enemies that's taliban be aware "
"indian national media shame on you ,"
BBC has a double standard in reporting. I think the Farmers are peaceful compared to the Hong Kong riots. Yet BBC always reports Hong kong riots as peaceful.
It's good that the farmers are protesting. The  govt. cannot have its own way all the time.
"India is Currently #4 Agricultural Prooduts Supplier for  the World. If new Farm Reforms are implemented, Farmers will have Full Freedom to sell to Indian Big Companies, Producticity increases, Diversification increases. This means, America and China will see drop in Supply of their Agricultural Products, As these Indian Companies start selling abroad, Making India #1 Agricultural Exporter."
I was literally crying when you clarify about 'nishaan sahib'....I am sikh and I am also not happy when nishan sahib was hoisted on red fort....but 'taali sirf ik hath se nahi bajti'. Iwill always support farmers....kisaan ekta zindabad
*I RESPECT AND SALUTE INDIAN FARMERS PARTICULARLY WHO FAUGHT LIKE ROCK SOLID*
"When Modi brings something then you guys bent upon to paint him as dictator but when he corrects / climbs down you guys don't want to say that he respects democratic values eventhough it was a bit late. He don't want to give leverage to opposition and get united under Sharad Pawar. He also need to break the Khalistani leverage within farmer groups. The farmer protest could have lingered even for years with their illegal money flown from anti national movement. Of course, he needs consider overall propects of his political party as a prominent leader of it."
*Farmers going on a fast for a day* 
"I can see a lot of comments criticizing government, its so unfortunate that they only know half of the story. I think literally no one knows why they are protesting ( the people out of india ), what government did to resolve it, they just want to criticize the government, just do some research on it guys before choosing a side."
With Farmers
Btw farming needs reforms but what has to be guaranteed must be inserted or deleted n not entire repeal!
"I have supported farmers since day 1. But this is just unbelievable, This is not right. No one and Nothing should replace the the Indian flag."
There's no need of military intervention by India. We don't have enough financial power like the USA. We don't need to spend billions in a war torn country. We've enough issues at home 
Problem is msp which government can't give legal assurance. Making msp legal can make indian farm products unsellable in global market due to their high price.
Modi ji great pm in the world
Indian government ko northern alliance ko support karna chahiye
"BJP should look for new leader, Modi  is too old and nowadays he is more concerned about his image building than the national interests. We need a strong leader, not a coward."
Police why you stop this is not India modi no come in the andhloan they need go please no stop same on modi no come in the andhloan
Why don't these all opposition work together to defeat BJP in next elections?
Don't  provoke  us our  blood  is  up  .MODI ji  speaks  universal  truth
"As a small farmer from uttarakhand i thought i would sell my hard earned vegetables wherever i can but unfortunately i guess this is my fate to die poor, and those who were protesting in their audis and bmws will remain rich by power."
Even government fire to the Kisan they don't afraid because we're Punjabi tell  to modi
Bjp wala smjh gya tha mere promoter and supporter follower km pdne laga to apna kanoon wapas lena pda

Praying for well being and prosperity fo farmers
As a common indian I was very disappointed and feel insecure. No faith in supreme court and even in Central government. If These kind of kisan then no difference in devile and these kissan sorry to say
"This is Karnal motherfuckers we will remember this, Haryana will remember this, BJP won't return to Haryana for at least 2 more decades"

"In Australia deregulation of the dairy industry has had many small farmers drop out. The big supermarkets have taken advantage. It is more expensive to buy 1 Litre of water, than 1 Litre of milk. India Farmers look after them as they supply your food!"
What you call them i my opinion there not farmer
Modi govt is wise to repeal the farm laws... But it was foolish to have enacted it in the first place...
Most shameful day In a nation of farmers
It's loss for farmers only
"Its high time that Govt.,; Modiji should see that the Farmers request is fulfilled.... afterall the law you say is in favour of Farers & if Farmers who are the real beneficiary is unhappy why you want to force it on them. At least today I wish your Sri Ram gives you the wisdom to think wisely & repeal those 3 unwanted Farm Laws.The whole World is watching us"
up me aab yahi hoga corona corona essi me hi bolne ka himmt h election ke rally me toh bol nhi paogi

"Namrata purvak aapne toh demo pe, GST pe, jobs pe, economy pe, and this year - Covid-19 pe aur China pe desh ki janta ko kya kya vadaa nahin kiya....ek bhi vadaa poora hua ho toh bataaiye...aur abhi you are doing the same with our poor innocent farmers.... Real misleading toh app kar rahe ho dear PM Ji!!!!"
Jai Farmers.
1. Why these were not taken back after 3 meetings with farmers and also arranged 13 seatings with farmers even though it was not taken back.
    bjp   congress   
There can't be any complacency on the canceling of farm laws which were not there.Responsible policy makers must bestow sincere efforts to protect the farmers from natural disasters practically avoiding slogans
"Shame on Indian Media, Indian Government, Indian Prime Minister, Delhi Police, Delhi Chief Minister."
Govt itni gadhi hai....they don't realuze ki moment ander se kitna strong hai..baar baar atyachar karke they are making it more strong..last year chup chap oct mei..govt ne peacefully protesting ffarmwrs ki mange man li hoti..easily sab sab settle hota...i say jo log waha baithe hai...aur already itna dard jhel chuke hai..itne dukho ke baad ab ho ge hai fear less...fatoo sarkar...modi sarkar...isko yeh moment le dubega...meri har dua mei farmers ki jeet hai...
"BBC is showing video of opposition parties of India? Isn't showing video and asking is enough? I have witnessed horrible violence at the time of Mayawati govt, Mulayam Singh's rule, and congress rule. They are telling the govt to take action. At the time of congress, my dad was attacked by knife in the hospital and still none of the police could catch the person who hs attacked. That was congress govt"
Its kind of good decision. Now farmers will understand what they missed. Modi did it for them but if farmers  still  want to remain poor and on the mercy of middle man then god should save them.
"They are god for us, We should always respect and support farmers."
"Corporate is not evil but informal one .    Farmer need to understand . As a license trader , farmer use any type of fertilizer and not do proper testing and not event want reduction . Sector need to be demand driven not supply driven .  At the end it a trader responsibility not farmer (sad reality) , we pay more tax . They not even grade their products ."
I fully support the Indian farmers and who would not but not the protest. Poor farmers have been brainwashed and misled for mere politics which is why it's super imp that we research and bring out the truth to our misled farmers.
"The battle may be temporarily lost, but the war is  not.My  vote always will go to BJP and MODIJI"
Nakli Kisan? Wow. Tehari got the fresh installment from BJP
"Thanks buddy, great explanation. At end what you have mentioned abt cutting margin by corporates had already happened, where farmers had agreement with Reliance fresh, easy day like stores and as the produce quantity flooded the market they starting making excuse that potatoes size shouldn't be that large, radishes shouldn't be that long. So, all in all they asked farmers that potatoes size shouldn't be larger than some standered ring size. Here comes the margin cutting in scenr. So, where will farmers go in such scenario. Some helpless farmers has end up throwing their produce on roads."
"Not everything should be seen from the perspective of economics. Such thought process is good for Western countries, especially the United States where the current liberal economic policies originate from. India is a land of 1billion plus population, majority of whom are farmers. Additionally, every state has its own manner of farming depending on the weather patterns, cultural dynamics and set historical patters. Now when economists such as the interviewee try to impose their western economic models, where agriculture is practised in a different manner, they are bound to get disappointed. In India, every state should have it's own farm laws, customized to the local farming practises. We should not always look to the west for progress but can develop our own model based on our circumstances."
"Biased news channel... Wrong depiction of Modi and laws as anti farmers. Laws were to avoid interference of middleman, who were taking advantage of high price, but farmers were unable to get proper prices."
"GDP ki lgi pdi h,farmers ,the ones for whose benefits this law is being implemented are protesting..."
Take back the 3 farm laws. We support farmers.
continuing tears of farmers is an curse for the country..
The agriculture minister himself is saying that there is no need of charcha (Discussion) on this ....yet some guys in the comment section think that repealing is good enough without a discussion..the new India mitron ...
"4. Civil courts have been added in the new ammendment as a place to settle disputes, its just that it takes a lot of time to disputes in courts, But now the farmer there also have the option."
"More than 60 percent of Indias 1.3 billion people still depend primarily on agriculture for their livelihood, though the sector accounts for only about 15 percent of the countrys economic output. "
"Farmers are siting peaceful in Protest in Dehli more than 60 days , more than 150 farmers died due to Dehlis cold.!0 meetings between Farmers Unions and govt failed.I pray govt comes  farward to solve farmers crisis."
"Is concensus possible in the parliament when we have pro-pakistan, pro- Khalistan and pro-china elements in the opposition ? Same things apply to the so called left leaning media also"
Well done farmer! F the media.
Bad... Worst... Its all over for Agricultural Reforms.   Tikait (Decoit ) won... Anna Hazare moment for Modi Government
Still he is blaming farmers that they disregarded such an honest decesion of krishi Qanoon
"4. As you discussed, farmer can sell there goods anywhere,  so why this reform if already govt have eNAM scheme."
"Now a days , Farmer are protesting  in Germany. You aren't showing."
"they are not farmers, they are the chamcha's of Congress"
Wait for 2024 modi will be literally kicked off parliament. 
Did you forget to mention that Greeta tweeted a toolkit which supported Khalistan considered to be terrorist in India ??
8) See Pakistani fake news propaganda that Indian Govt is against Sikhs! Not one opposition politician or farmer leader refuted this! 
"I don't know what's wrong or what's right, but one thing I'm sure of is Modi ji is the new Hitler, and this government can do whatever it likes without even letting people realize it."
"Just saw Republic tv reporter trying to change the narrative by shouting ""the police is pleading(joining hands) to the farmers"""
So pleased and happy for our farmers. God be with you always.
Finally farmers won 
farmer's protest have failed due to violence
These farmers leave farming
"Doing babri demolition thimes the guns,granade,barricade where not invented yaar,where where you the brown shirted waalas,hats off farmers,They stay silent for more than two months,but you underestimated them because they are only farmers,you will now arrest many farmers because you have everything but sure you will suffer lot ,this is just a beginning of your nightmares."
"This is the victory of the farmers and a shameful defeat of the government's ego, arrogance and pro-capitalist policies. If the government and its leader had shown the wisdom at the proper time, lives of hundreds of kisans could have been saved. Hope that a little more  thoughtfulness on the part of government would fulfill expectation of people on bringing law on MSP."
"Msp pe baat jarrohona chahia,honable pm modiji msp c250 pe hona chahiye"
If the kisans dont want to end the agitation let them continue . Kisans form part of country. Tikait awaits orders from congress to end andolan.
"He is actually misleading to the ordinary Indian farmers. Tradition of dumping and throwing of own party members into the dustbin, not a new thing from their groups. reach to the degree of Dictatorship system?"
Thank God that this protest brought people from all walks of life together for the farmers.
Why the government isn't stepping back from farmers bil
"Every body is criticising the laws,  no body is proposed the better guidelines to benefit farmers"
"Now all the andha bhakt got official position "" sarkari Taliban"""
APMC fees (8.5%) doesnt get deducted from farmers income. Its being paid by buyer (FCI) on top of crops bill
Whenever a person(farmer or govt/private employers) takes a loan he estimates that he can pay the installments but  sometimes someone in his family gets contracted with some disease his whole money or property  gets used because of lack of good fair price hospitals.
Congratulations to all Kishan n mazdoor.... Jo v morche de hak check c
"I can live without my phone, but I can't live without farmers who produce my food."
" No corporates can store all the foodcrops in a state. So far i know there is a law for that. But now farmers are excluded.Before police will not allow farmers to stock, or even they cannot take their products to other states."
"Why non farming population should worry? New laws will create massive unemployment and internal security problems. Above all corporations will become too big and too significant for any future Govt to do course correction not only in farming but in consumer market as well since these corporations will have end to end monopoly. In future Govt's primary function would be to put out fires with army and paramilitary forces because neighboring countries will create internal security problems by exploiting frustrated and ignored sections of society. Foreign Investment will not only cease but run out in such environment except aggressive exploiters like Vedanta, Adani, United Fruits etc. There will be two types of Indians, one living comfortably in tight security zones and one living miserably trying to save their skin from these 'Zaildars"" of 'East India Company' group."
Rakesh tikait you are saying right 
Ppl protesting here non r farmers...
India Will be Save By a farmer's
Punjab was lost in Congress time to terrorism and dissent nt. This protest is a continuation of dissent and national betrayal.
"Make more video to show whats happening at farmers protest Because no one else is showing the same,we have believe on YouTube media..."
They are not Farmers they are gunde 
Even a simple farmer knows what's wrong with the laws and Agriculture Minister asks in the parliament what's wrong with the laws??. that sounds more like mischief rather than ignorance...
"Media channels here in Kerala showed great support to the farmers and celebrated the victory...Newspapers like Hindu held actual facts too. ""The farmers really deserved support""."
BJP neta determine to finish farmers.
Over 95 percentage of tractors are owned by rich farmers NSSO report
I fully support this decision farmers know what is good or bad for them jai kisan
"80% of farmers didn't see the farm bills, benefits, didn't see the rules & protesting on others words..."
Lolz equal rights for everyone. INDIA is very very under Modi Todi govt
Very well explained and I hope the farmers learn about their rights to get maximum benefits from these bills
"Well, to shorten the case, the laws of mandi will remain intact. The new laws are for something outside the mandis. If farmers are skilled enough to produce quality food, then instead of minimum selling price(MSP), they can sell it to corporates or restaurants through contracts like those done in commodity markets. And the new laws are putting these corporates and restaurants or any other bidder to pay the farmers and obey the contract. So these laws are just another option, and that doesn't banish the mandis option."
This was all over social media from past week. Modi take back the farm bills and say that he did that because of Amrinder Singh (Punjabs ex CM) and then he gonna make a collision govt with them.
I think farmers should are responsible because they should not go to the red Fort
I stand with farmer 
Bcz cong got govt in punjab so they also got support from cpi n cpm
"Yogi Adityanath is also on target as he is getting more acceptance as hindutva leader than Modi. This move will affect small farmers of UP in Purvanchal. First the Brahmins are angry on yogi, then yogi action on Kaleem Siddiqui who had relations with Mohan bhagwat and now this."
"It's not about religion,it's about humanity,why some people are supporting Taliban and saying Afghanistan become independent. How come Afghanistan become independent when their citizens are suffocating in their own country with Taliban regime"
Modi cares for his poll victory MORE than anything else on earth !
Only from punjab and haryana and maharashtra
"There is a khalistani group 'Sikhs for justice' funded by American CIA which announced 1.8 crore to whoever will host sikh flag on India gate/red fort on 26 Jan, remember one thing for life, whenever there is a riot anywhere in the world, some George Soros money is floating around."
"Tikait was  only a puppet in the name of farmers, why had he not made any movement when thousands of people committed  in Maharashtra during 2006 to 20011"
"I believe Ground work all set by farmers and farm leaders, rural vote slipping from BJP big trouble for BJP,  not working anything for BJP big issues like unemployed, inflation will cost BJP badly, BJP leaders are not able to enter villages, they are facing protest and are insulted by the villagers, a lots of video are in circulation in Social media."
"We can understand the circumstances which makes you to withdraw these bills which would have bring the better days for farmers, inspite of taking good decision for the future for us we failed you by no opposing those fake farmer's"
You made an assumption that farmers are getting the fair price from the middlemen. Any data to back it up?
"Do u all know, govt. Openly requested farmers to come and discuss, which line in farm law they think is bad, govt will remove it."
BJP/RSS  have the same Ideology of Taliban. 
Sanghis it's time u understand the truth stop supporting this extremist govt Jai jawaani Jai kisaan
India should support freedom fight for independence of Quebec from Canada.
Beggars bluddy farmers ...even my dog will not pie on you
"BJP need not worry about any negative electoral impact and in fact it is bound to gain very positively a lot electorally both in the long and short run. But the crucial and some what the urgent need of the hour is that BJP should deploy its best communication and campaign skills in dispelling \ countering \ negating the poisonous, extremely negative and a very wide inimical campaign started by the many rich farmers and very rich arthriyas (middlemen) in absolute collaboration with some political parties that are against the BJP against the new 3 farm laws in order to influence the poor and marginal farmers of Jats and of India also."
Is the bill for the farmers or farmers are for the bill
"It is an election gimmick as 7 states are going for Assembly polls in 2022 namely Punjab, U.P, Uttarakhand, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur and Gujarat."
Full support to  Farmers.
"Much as I would want to disagree, I must admit that AIM has the best measure of the Modi BJP's costly  cynical self  - seeking political moves."
We are not there to support them but thank you for everything you team are doing very great work for india 
"There are majorly 2 ends of this problem, at production end (farmer) and at marketing end. At farmer end, problem of seed selection, or credit availability or using ICT for connecting with experts is there and it is explained quite well in this. Further from marketing end, https://youtu.be/qb7x84PS4mk this video will help take some initiatives. In my opinion, small landholding is also one of major cause of farmers, as it restricts economics of scale. May we some co-operatives (like in lines of Dairy cooperatives ) can be formed in future."
India or any other country did not have any stake in the formation process of such terrorist groups. Because India do not support state sponsored terrorism. 
"Yes mr modi you are right, this law's is biggest key of bjp party corporate fund."
Once in Singur West Bengal same kind of huge protest has been organized by the farmers against TATA company for establishing their automobile company in singur. Farmers won the battle making TATA leave Bengal after 5 years later no major company is ready to establish their company in Bengal and now Bengal became the 3rd largest exporter of skilled and non-skilled labor to western and southern states.
Shekhar ji. I believe we need another ctc to explain why Punjab and Haryana farmers are protesting new Farm bills and who is right and wrong and why. On paper farm bills appears right for farmer but we cannot ignore mass protest as case of mass hysteria. There are few arguments from opposing side we cannot ignore. Matter is not too trivial for large North Indian community. We need to cut the clutter and come out clean on what is right and wrong with opposition of these bills. Rest of the media is too busy being influenced by either side.
The word ' middleman ' is Being criminalized throughout decade. Every educated nuts like us and also our policymakers Don't know what crucial role a middleman plays in supply chain and how deeply and logically farmers are dependent on them. They are not just money grabbers what most of us think. The price gap of a product between Farm gate and retail price is not just middleman's profit. Most of it is the cost of providing services and wastage of produce throughout the process because of inefficient supply chain.
Finally protest ends and now the real farmers make a move for this 3 amendment laws
"2- Stubble burning and subsequent surge in air pollution in and around the NCR region cannot be dealt lightly, neither in short run nor in long run. The approach should be accommodative, cooperative, judicious and participatory to tackle the issue involving Every stakeholders but these farmers have been reluctant or rather insensitive to this perpetual problem."
"Not happy with Taliban success, but on a lighter note, is this means Pakistan defeat super power and NATO??"
Yogendra yadav always stand with farmers .. My first meeting jantar mantar 2017
"Thank god, finally a video from your channel which raises Farmers concern. Thank You Sir"
Without Farmers No Food.
"Kick the butt of the BJP in the upcoming election. General people across India should think, why are these people wasting their time for the past 9 months. "
All the development of India during BJP govt is in social media only. Only numbers you can find everytime from explanation of govt.
Fed up of these farmers.
We Eat because of farmers.. We have to respect them and their demands 
"Those who are supporting Owaisi ,you are nothing better than bhakts ,one side u guys are opposing Bjp because of communalism and other side support Owaisi ,lol how hypocrite u guys are ..."
An eyeopener account on farm bills and why we should stand with farmers. Govt is simply acting insensitive to the matter. Preposterous.
See how conveniently you have side stepped  the money power of the Punjab Aditya brokers and their hold on the Punjab farming  communities. The farm brokers are as powerful as the Zamindar- Army combination of Pakistan. It is time to smash this and only Modi is capable of doing it.
For India farmers!! Fight for your right and freedom!!
"*Koi Yeh Na Soche Ki India Ko Hi Problem Hogi Taliban Se Pakistan Mein Sabse Bure Din Bhi Aa Sakte Hain,So We Pray For Both The Countries Protection *"
Pictures are found of Aman Nihang meeting with BJP top leaders of Punjab clicked few day before this incidents..
"The decision to repeal the farm laws is really very bad and it's gonna cost the loss of credibility of this government. But there is something that doesn't add up, because every common person knows that BJP is not even in the race in Punjab so how can the PM don't  know this. I don't believe this."
Why you ppl allowed for tractor rally ?
54+ Islamic (Muslim majority) countries in the world but not even 1 Hindu nation.
The farmers are rebels without a cause. The don't understand what the are fighting about. They are the shame of the nation
"Why the hell all opposition back farmers and it it as if thier victory ,one idiot comparing modi to ravan also this is cheap politics... Indias should  come to street and fight for correct fm laws to be implement which modi did..."
"What a great democratic leader. Absolutely humble in accepting mistakes. It only took him 1 year, 700 deaths of farmers and by poll election results to take such a brave decision. May India continue to move forward in this direction of leaders like him for self-destruction "
Police Vs farmers.      Both are backbone of our country but main villain is Modi sarkar who giving orders to police and watching this
"I was knowing that the farmers were protesting in kurukshetra but I was not knowing why, but now I got to know"
Agar koi celebrity's ya rich insan mar jata to sab uska dukh bante 1 2 mahine tak or social media pr video news viral hote ab humare desh ke kisan or javano ki mout hui h to sach or jhut m fase hue h 
Farmers are not stopped to sell APMC then why so much opposition
"So called university ""educated"" people and intellectuals need to learn a lesson from farmers. UNITY AND PERSEVERANCE PAYS. If you are united, you can face any difficulty, including the pompous BJP Gov who thought they could roll over the farmers and gift a huge market to their ""funding agencies"" ... the Adanis and Ambanis of this world. Hey you can all eat crow now!"
Modi is wrost pm in the history of INDIA
Proud to be Farmers
"Punjab and Haryana farmers got succeeded in their agenda, now the farmers from other state can't compete with them and became as much rich as they are, because of just 2-3 states now whole india is suffering."
"After disaster of demonisation it is good because I came from farmer's family. And I know how bad are apmc now in india and corruption and cartilization stole the market and farmers get nothing as there are middle man in middle man's, so it becomes long chain of middlemen and destroys farmers."
Also a word of thanks to team NL for their consistent and committed coverage of the struggles of the farmers.Thanks again.
So what's the final solution for farmers. APMC dealers are exploiting them and as per your explanation corporatisation is also bad. Where should farmers go ?
If MSP is made a law then traders will have to pay it and not the government. BJP is protecting the traders and not the farmers.
Evil ....God help your farmers 
*The Farm Laws were being used to create a wedge between Hindus and Sikhs in Punjab and the Khalistan Movement was piggy backing on it and a full-fledged return to terrorism was the next step.*
"Those opposing the farm bill should at least watch this video once. Anyway, I support this Farm bill."
We always support our farmers...hats off to them
I am from a small village  I think this bill is also good for farmers 
Big victory for farmers.. modis draconian laws were forced to be withdrawn
The current Indian pm would have agreed to the demands if these farmers had been Tea farmers
"My grandfather were a framer and I support farm law. We are obsessed with middle man and want to eliminate farm law. The people who are protesting are either mindwashed or middle man. Our people also deserve better life. Time will come when Punjab doesn't get  cheap labour from Bihar,UP,MP, Rajasthan and Bengal and it's time  for us to rise. It's the same Punjabi who fought with britishers in 1857 first war of Independence against us. The country are with the farm law."
"People should make ""Amar Kisan Smarak"" at India Gate as a tribute to thousand farmers died to save their farms from modern Ghori."
"Shekhar ji, only a very small percentage of grain produced is sold at MSP, and that too from Punjab and Haryana. If the govt. (FCI) stop buying from P&H, the problem will be solved to a great extent but I am sure it's not as simple as this, so the clutter remains!!!"
"Its nice to see what my fellow Indians think. Unfortunately it doesnt matter. Modi does not care. Its Farmers today, will be Citizens tomorrow. Its just a matter of time."
Jai jawan !! ( most of them farmers sons )!!!
Its a shame that some media outlets see this as a victory
"i m not a political guy but this is not a kisan andolan at all. modi ki publicity km krne k liye, kisan , gribi ya soldiers bus yhi to trike he, opposition k pas ...aur unhone use krna sik liya he "
"Unresearched and baseless journalism. This is typical of Vice news of late, sad story. Any Indian citizen will tell you these are politicians not farmers. Thanks for wasting my time."
#WeStandWithFarmers
We have many videos made on why farmers are protesting but no one discuss about their demands
Sarkar apni zimmedari se bach rahi hai..jesa Petrol k sath kiya.. co-op decide krenge price kitna hona chahiye.. based on demand. If demand is low price will be low. And in off season price will be out of limit. Let's see privatization of backbone of Indian economy.

"Agar kissan apna pao pe kural marna chahta hein to karne do. Uneducated logo ke sath aise hi hona chahiye. This is called natural selection. Agar kissan ka income zaada ho geya to hamara bhi to cost of living badh jayega na? In fact, mere hisab se agar kissan new farm bill ke rasto mein aake andolon bhi kare to woh bill pass nehi hona chahiye."
"So big corporate hoarders will create artificial gluts to buy cheaply from the farmers. And then create artificial scarcity to sell dearly to the end-consumers. So basically a lose-lose situation for both farmers and consumers, and a win-win situation for the private firms."
"The US knows that once its military presence is completely out of Afghanistan, it won't take a second for the Taliban to tear down the democratic govt of Afganistan, they must make sure that the govt stays functional otherwise it'll be disastrous for two countries first Afganistan itself and second India, cause the Taliban won't be attacking Pakistan and the taliban already said that China is its friends, so it's just India that remains in between!"

Arfa the excelled journalist. God bless you. Thanks for true reporting. Now no need of main  or bikaow godi media. Social media has filled void place.
So india is saying Pakistan army and isi defeated USA & nato and soviet forces
"A real enlightening exposition on farm laws. Congress Party stands exposed on its duplicity. However, BJP did no less politicking on farm reforms when Congress proposed it in Parliament but was vehemently opposed by BJP in both upper and lower houses. No party, I find, is doing above board politics. "
"But I still don't get it. It finally boils down to which choice a farmer makes, right?"
Koi kisan Nahi he sirf politics up election tak chalega.
Ma'am with all due respect! I think a farmer can sell his produce outside the mandi or in any other state. Correct me if I'm wrong.
Thankyou so much for your support. We need more local Delhi residents supporting our farmers 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SUPPORT TO FARMERS. GOD BLESS YOU ALL.  BEST WISHES FOR YOUR FUTURE .
---Supported and financed the terrorist organization Tamil LTTE to rebel against Sri Lanka government
Ofcourse no reasons to continue protest now. But I'm sure the so-called farmers won't move still as Tikait is excusing now.
"Leave the farmers alone they never asked for this bill, Modi government is trying to make business men rich corporations rich he doesnt care about the common man. Jai Kisaan Jai Jawan."
Repeal of law is a loss to the real farmers and the nation.
Why are we saying farmers are against this bill.? Farmers from Punjab and haryana doesnt represent All Indian farmers.The farmers from state which take maximum benifit of MSP and Mandi system are opposing due to introduction of parrallel system..
"They are not farmers.... A true indian farmer would never hurt indian people... They are rioting and damaging public property, causing distortion among people, vandalising streets..... I support the government here, they should be more strict on people like this.... The farmer who died was rampaging the tractor and was tryna run over cops after some havoc the tractor turned over and the farmer died,,,, they even vandalized nation's national flag.... Shameful farmers"
Our country needs a honest government and the one who is willing to listen and understands farmers
Arrest Chadhuni for inciting the farmers.
Jai kisan .....salute all farmers and you tube media anchor
heart breaks to see how farmers are forced to live in such cold weather but for them the pain caused by  those farmer laws is more..
#standwithfarmers
"One second you say MSP encourages Monoculture,  another second you say only 6% farmers get MSP and model should be extended. It should be extend so there can be more Monoculture.? You say government doesn't have space store grain, then you say government should have more mandis ? The need of the hour is transparent market acess, hand holding of farmers by corporates and scientific community."
"Sorry for asking, but wouldn't this situation be resolved if the government just introduced new minimum price laws for the produce of the farmers and enforce them? That way the three farm laws would be acceptable, the system would rid off middlemen and both the farmers and the government would get what they want. Again, apologies for my naivete regarding the issue, just wanting to understand the situation better."
Very bad that farmers done in our country. Country first all other next
No vote for bjp in up uk punjab and goa
Ravish Ji you show the good prime show we proud for your work godi media destroy the democracy but you try live democracy this is tamtacha on bjp and godi media
"How about limiting the number of farmers cropping the same crops and/or limiting area of crops for each crop. Example: limiting sugar cane crops to 1 million acres and divide that by the number of farmers doing that crop,then,they can crop something else if they have extra land left."
Farmers protest have Justice
"People in Punjab nd Haryana, don't let uninvited people enter in their villages."
true kisans are too overrated sometimes I feel that India is left behind because of this fool kisan of India other countries like China and us has the same law we Indians will be always be behind because of this kisans 
"Instead of farmers bills, long over due us Government should pass a law ""Death for Corruption"" as in China. Has  this government got  the courage to pass such a bill.?????"
Dont give up Indian farmers!
It hurts makes me cry seeing our old people and everyone else too trying so hard to get their own rights this is the country which says jai jawaan jai kisaan and our kisaan is suffering so much just because of this one man narendra modi i don't know how he sleeps at night doesn't he gets nightmares.... god is seeing we are seeing someone's gonna punish this man so bad that he'll definitely remember everything everything bad he did.... karma man karma strikes back

Onesided news both side violence were happen.....and also farmer died...
Salute to student and farmers
thanks for supporting to Farmers
India also have to take security step against Taliban
Good recapitulation of the fact. It is the biggest movement againat the elected Govt.The sacrifice of the lives will give the befitting reply to the BJP government and the dalal media.
"In my view Mandir Development is not important. Need to give true strength( financially support, Unity, training in physically fitness etc. to Hindus."
"Majority of Indians voted for a Govt. to run a country on behalf of us. We should support all the steps made by them, at least 5 years.Democracy doesnt mean revolts."
Modi has made his puppets as CM in every BJP ruling state
"@SG, this episode was more like a political interest and not like ""National Interest"". You should have told us that what was good and bad in these three bill from your own perspective and not what Rahul Gandhi and others say. irony is that how constructive discussion is done in parliament. Like, it is responsibility of Government to take decisions for uplift of people and also it is responsibly of opposition to have constructive opposition on any topic and not just oppose for the sake of opposition. This mindset by politicians and journalists is costing India huge."
Pappu of now = BJP aka Narendra Modi
We should stop the food supply to all Godi media...than talk!
"One i was only a Bjp supporter! Dimag sei socho toh We all are suffering,! Hindu muslim karke public ka kaat raha hai,mera bhaiyon Hindu Muslim karke koi fayda nhi hai! India Is a democratic country  country!"
Thoda economics padhiye please. Farmers are operating in Perfect Competition. They are price takers. They need huge investment for thier growth. 
Prime minister has to sit with gurnam face to face. Without that farmers will not go back. Parliament sessions behind scene will not work.
Modi is rejecting the earlier setup installed by earlier govt regimes.
Good work by farmer
"There is an India represented by Tamil Nadu, and another by Bihar. They are far apart on human development, but both belong to the same India on electricity and drinking water.The fifth National Family Health Surveys findings make it clear yet again that there are indeed two Indias, as the comedian Vir Das has said in his own way. The India represented by Tamil Nadu has less than a third of the diarrhoea cases reported from the India represented by Bihar. It also has only 40 per cent of the infant mortality rate, and 60 per cent of the fertility rate. The obverse is that Bihar has only two-thirds of Tamil Nadus ratio for literate women, or doctors per 1,000 population, but a 50 per cent higher ratio of stunted and wasted children."
That is peaceful protest by farmers and opposition
"This is painful. We people get food because of the farmers and what is happening is really unfortunate, shameful and disgusting."
There is no question on the need for laws to get rid of unscrupulous middlemen between farmers and consumers. How does taking away Mandis going to help? Mandis were set up to prevent exploitation of farmers in the first place! How come it become breeding ground for middle man??
stand with farmers
"poor farmers lost, rich farmers won"
Yes: I agree that whole the world is watching this all in the shades of Chinese presence at borders. These farmers are providing bread  and butter to this country of 1.3 billion people. Have mercy on farmers who are out for the last 2 months from  their homes due to some sound reasons.
"Tikait has got political ambitions. The other side, so called kisans, are also crossing limits. How to control them...Could they be be allowed to do anything under garb of some Andolan."
I honestly feel farmers were mislead ..mostly genuinely protesters were middle men which are so much in Punjab...though on front it looks farmers didn't want it..so good Modi roll them back..I hope they come up with other reforms..by yes we need reforms..
" When Modi was just six months old, India had hosted the first Asian Games in New Delhi and Jawaharlal Nehru introduced India's first five-year plan."

that just mention INDIA in the Thumbnail and you would get billions of views....
I with farmer  i with jawan or kissan
It's just Punjab and Haryana farmers which are unhappy
"I donno which channel is saying the truth, there are channels which show the good side of farm bill then there's a channel which shows loopholes in farm bill.... Hopefully this riots get fixed"
Government acting as dumbard...must listen and repeal laws against farming 
"@ThePrint , Sir I am a Farmer's son in Hubli, Karnataka. My father grows Maize, soyabean and safflower. We don't get MSP for anything. Can't government buy soyabean, safflower at MSP in Karnataka ? If it can, why is it not buying ?"
Please do make a detailed video on how commission agents in mandis play with farmers
"People of Haryana and Punjab, ye bill sirf kisano ko kamzoor nahi karega balki in rajeyo ki arthvayevstha ko khokhla kardega. Agar kisan ke pas kharach karne ko paisa nahi hoga to shahar main vayapaar kaise hoga. Please I request everyone whether businessman, student, private employee to protest this bill as at the end of the day it will impact everyone."
Le kisan - hold my tractor
Blood chilling lynching of innocent BJP workers reminds us of Talibans murdering their opponents in Afganisthan
"Ppl who are agitating in the garb of farmers are mainly middlemen whose empire has been demolished by these 3 acts,as we all know these middlemen are mostly small/mid level political leaders who controll the Mandis,its a revolutionary act which will change the farm sector of India"
-why is government doing conferences all over india but not to the farmers in Delhi?
Farmers are real heros
Bloody goons should have some gratitude for the farmers who feed them
ASEAN farmers should pay more attention to this... Our thoughts and prayer be with you farmers of india...
No farmers No food
The leader which keeps farmers of India happy will rule the country.

"Dear Sir,  Tikait Saab's detailed explanations in this interview is simply very fantastic, Sir. Hats off to you, Sir. Dear Sir,  the Ads appearing in your videos, also, simply very supportive and also superb,  Sir. Salaams. "
I feel very sorry for Indian citizen when you have people in the government telling people do more crime and you will be in the government high position after you come out of jail very shame for BJP
Hats off to the farmers.
Shame on modi you must listen the voice of kisaans
made Modi Jittery and total Nervous
"2) They were saying that police and army are their brothers! ""If one person in a family is a farmer another is in the police or army"", they said. Now they have attacked the police who were showing restraint. How come?"
these are very small portion of farmers in which u can see alot of khalistani and shaaheen bagh muslims. clearly it is politically motivated.
Concession and benefits of agriculture should be given to only small farmers those income below 5 lakhs per annum. All rich farmers having income more than 5 lakhs to be included in tax scanner. And progressive tax to be charged. 
I urge to all farmers be united.
Poor farmers are helpless. Even the govt is helpless before the broker mafias. There will be an end to all mafias.
Congrats to everyone who support farmer protest even on social media..Kudos to us.
"Love, care, equality& respect to every jeev atma or every human beings. Hindus also mard soo come out in the favour of farmers. Every religion and every one supports farmers because farmer are ann data. Farmers feed everyone food, vegetables to every one. Farmer are also God."

"Listening to DK Singh is anytime yes  . DKSingh says they did support farm laws in principle yes, but at the same time Shekar Gupta was propagating about how the poor farmers are going to suffer just by making assumptions and painting sinister color to it"
Deepest respect for the farmer brothers and sisters!
People need to accept MSP / Subsidies / Loan waivers/Tax. Breaks are short term measures not perpetually guaranteed policy... They have to go away with time once their short term goal is met... They are polices to support  not to bring incompetence... Today farmers in Punjab are well of thanks to MSP but that prosperity can't be ridden on Govt for all the times... MSP is a policy instrument and it can't be a perpetually guaranteed govt policy.. if done it would be an economic blunder in the long run... And for a Political party it won't hurt in the short run to make a MSP law just to be in power but it will create more problems for the future of the country as a whole...
I think it's a good law for the farmers but government should also ensure that APMC Markets will be continue In such a way as they are running now
2. If every farmer would just grow MSP crops then any suggestions on problems that may create agricultural imbalance in the country and problems of the other non MSP crop farmers.
Sir Best wishes to those all Farmers and those Media channel who stand in front of this Government and stand with correct things thank you 
Sir I want to ask a simple question before this bill Private companies were not allowed to procure crops directly from the farmers?
20% farmer opposing 80% supporting this bill let that sink in
Farmers land belong to corporate. Jamakhori is legal now.
The only channel which presented a neutral view on the farm laws. I don't support bjp but I still support the farm laws after understanding the economics behind it. 
"Hats off to the farmers braving bitter cold weather, Modi's bigotry and Indian media "
"And today 19th of November 2021, the Central Government of India repeals all three anti-farmer Farm Laws! Huge day for India!"
"Stay strong, farmers "
3. I do agree that there will be an increased intervention by private players in the farm produce sector however at every point the farmer is the decision making authority wether they wanna deal at APMC mandis or Direct to buyer and wether they wanna get into a finite contract with a private buyer or they wish to sell their produce as they have been doing all this while. 
And also why no punishment to Taini for killing innocent farmers protest silently with vehicle????
Up and punjab mai election aane waale hai
"Gupta ji, please don't brush aside the concerns of those who oppose because it's unlikely that a farmer has the choice to transport and sale his produces wherever prices are higher. Also as of today only 6% of farmers get MSP benefit, so MSP is not removed doesn't hold much water. Also there's potential to corporatise agriculture, which is unlikely benefit farmers, remember Jio??"
If you can talk with farmers they will surely hear you
"Being a farmer myself, I DO NOT support the government on this bill. I have sold my wheat produce on MSP, as well as to private players. The claim by the government that a farmer prior to this bill could not sell to a private player is a total LIE. In fact ,I always had an option to bargain better with a private purchaser due to MSP. This will gradually push me to look at other crops than wheat and rice. If all farmers slowly start shifting from the staple crops, then price are bound to increase."
I have been a BJP supporter for long time. Never have i been this dissapointed. The farm law was revolutionary in many aspects. Now every opposition party will think they have won.
I'm from a farmer family based in Gujarat.... I was lucky I got a chance to study in Canada and also explore other countries around the world.... Farmers in western countries are making millions and they work through a system that Indian government want's to implement.
Modi and yogi has become general dayer of independent india

"They are middlemen. Long Live Comrade Modi . What the Left, Congress  did not do ...BJP has done that. The Peasantry is now free and industrial capital is introduced in Agricultural breaking the middlemen nexus with politician. Being a Marxist, I support BJP and PM Modi."
"Take down the controversial farm laws, problem solved. I completely blame the govt for this. You make laws for the farmer & the farmer did not like, then, why still force the law??"
I have done my LLB in Germany. You explained everything very well but there are farmers who keep protesting in Germany because there is no MSP. Farmers are being pressurized by private sector as there is no MSP. Farmers are getting the lowest rate. There should be a MSP on every product
#SuspendModi from Rajyasabha for blatantly lying about MSP being in the Farm bill

Black day for real farmers

"That's what democracy means. That's how a protest should work. Their honesty, their unity, that's indian farmers. Rab is there!"
This protest is so wrong and now it proves that its all politics...They just want to ruin the very important day of the country and its so sad to see ...I just wanna ask that where these so called farmers minister are who said that they'll take the responsibility and will do a quite protest....I oppose this protest and tractor march..Jai hind 
"If all the farmers decide to cut down production by 20% instead Protesting, they will make more money because of demand."
"Khoom phirkar she came onher given agenda by present government. Hindu Muslim, Hussain etc."
Jai ho farmers 
Those laws were to give freedom specially to the small farmers who couldn't get a chance to sell at their nearest mandi. The big farm owners used to exploit them by buying at law price and selling in mandi at high price. The poor farmers trapped in this protest and again lost its war of freedom and development.
"If this was a Pan India protest why there was no one from large rice producing states like Andhra, Tamilnadu, Karnataka, Bengal did not join and agitate for full year. This is not an Indian farmer agiataion but agitation of farmers belonging to two and a half states of India who would lose their source of. Income if government stops the mandi. Press is also silent on the funding given from extremist organisations in Canada and UK without which these agitations would have run out of steam in the long run. Press should also look into the funding received by these so called indian farmers."
"Very well explaiined... , about the farming bills"
These are no farmers. They are the same middlemen who has caused farmer poverty in the first place. These middle men are politically motivated and must be crushed at all costs.
"Weak PM, the whole nation's farmers will suffer because of Punjab, Surrender Modi 2024 re-election lost."
"Kisan should be alert, bjp government will try to use division tactics as BJP is very popular in doing so."
"A website to aware farmers, connect with other famers, and a feature to find right price for thier crop. I am going to make this site. "
Union minister son was driving  The farmers have identified him.
Let me tell how it turned violent police attacking farmer with weapons was ok but when nihanh singh protected farmers they were called atwaadi like guru Gobind Singh Ji was called baaghi

If Indian gov takes covid 19 seriously than should hold talks immediately
Very informative with a generous amount of sarcasm ! Ouch Modi ji ouchh

Salute the farmers!
"just insert in the same law that MSP IS MANDATORY AND IF ANYONE TRIES TO BUY FROM FARMER BELOW MSP ,THEY WILL BE SUBJECTED TO THE CONTEMPTS MENTIONED IN LAW. (this is clearly mentioned in FSA ACT ALSO) "
Poor DK Singh. His leader has let him down. This man did not once mention the deficiency in the bills and why farmers opposed them. Just kept saying that they were reforms. 
"Can clearly tell the position of the BBC is not on the side of the farmers based on the questions the interviewer is told to ask, trying to make it seem like the farmers are the bad guys."
Despite that some more percentage of farmer be benefited from Gov procurement. The value a seller gets in his relationship with the buyer depends upon whether the seller has an alternative option. Otherwise the buyer exploits his monopoly power.
Thanks to haryana Western UP and Punjabi kissan..atleast MSP pe discussion to hone laga.. implement ho ya na ho atleast logo ko pata to Chala
This is what happens when somebody who doesn't know hoots about India & it's farming issues tries to support under the garb of being funny... Trevor expected better research .... No wonder they day agendas drive social media these days...
"There is no permanent friend or permanent enemy in diplomacy, only permanent interest. India should start accepting the Talibans and work in hand with them"

Rakesh tiket is a biggest leader in farmer's community
If they don't crush farmers then they will be alive
These are not terrorists these are farmers trying to save the agriculture sector from the hands of capitalist monopoly. But govt funded media channels trying to defame them as khalistani terrorists or funded by opposition political party just because they wear turbans and have flag of their religion sikhism.
Jai Jawan Jai Kisan ..we alyzz with our farmers 
"Well said Pakistan, and Victory for Taliban on your Independence Day for New Afghanistan."
One year of protest on the roads during a COVID pandemic and THEN the worlds biggest democracy chooses to repeal the 3 farm bills 
"Traditionally  much of the APMC stalls are owned by  members of a particular community ,thanks to the pseudo secular regimes of islamic congress.  This is the main reason for the heartburn.  Farmers are easy to manipulate and cartelisation of commission agents in APMC is very easy bcz most members belong to a particular community."
Great result for the resolve of our farmers. They are showing India the way. United we stand and we can bring the mighty down.
We need a law that has a specific requirement to be a prime minister .  dont think  modi ji will qualify 
4 wasted is on farmers
Pakistan should help us just like india helped bengladeshies in 1971.
Our government is really great they listen and do what the farmers want them to do really appreciate my government's work. No matter that farmers were wrong or may be right
the best coverage ever. Scoop whoop does best as always. Kisaan Zindabad
Don't support farmers
Thank you for supporting farmers  and Indian democracy
Shame to all for supporting ruckus .. public nuisance.. a true farmer can never afford to leave his field and play political games...
"3) In the video it is already mentioned that cartelization and teaming up happens in APMC markets today, so what is the sense in continuing with the same system and support more middle men who do not let the farmers get the worth of their hard work & toil?"
This is the victory of old farm laws. Better to implement those laws for 2 to 3 years then we can find output. 
We are with farmers of punjab
"I am with the farmers ""father of national""."
people like you and me buy from bazzaar whre in the farmers sell cheap and we buy at higher prices and the middle men make the most. Now when the govt gives the farmers and option to sell directly to corporates which will be benificial to them and to consumers.
Childrens are  reluctant to take bitter pill but ultimately it cures them of disease.... similarly naive farmers seems to be misguided to take the pills of reform....looks they would continue to live in poverty and mercy of middle man 
longlive farmers
Very good analysis of problems of farmers  Really Appreciate
Totally concocted stories from everywhere. Absolute disregard for the farmers. Politics only. The opposition has no clue on how to oppose a popular govt. 
To end you said I want something in some price before produce  lock in price   .... gap between farm an fork
A big salute to the ruling party & to our beloved PM Mr. Modiji. y isn't he even released any statement yet.waiting to see more such incidents?
"the law is came for only real farmers dear,not for like u people,,,,,his product he have to sale in high price for his welfare,not for ur welfare,also in india have lot of buisness peoples so there shold be a competion,so farmer can choose the costomer,   the all farmers are misunderstant by the polititions.this mandies policy cause all year lot of lose for farmers."
"GARBAGE FARMERS... Vietnam rejects Indian rice as not fit for humans ... Punjab rejects new Farm Laws. Yet Pubjab allows  Kisans from Bihar to sell rice massively in Punjab. Amazingly most of the protesting Farmer Unions are Panjus, perhaps they do not know what is happening in their own backyard or they do not understand the new laws ...  the average Indian farm size is only 2.28 hectares, they do not have tractors. Tikhait is a Congress ally and failed in elections. Seems these farmers are only out to BLACKMAIL the country."
I will protect the farmers...
This chap is still saying the farm laws were good. Couldn't expect anything better from this Bhakt of Modi and BJP.
Ar ye to india Pakistan ka border ha 26jan can ve avoided btw
"How could you do this arnab? Even you know prime minister loose this match with farmers. , Better prime minister put 3 masks when he is going to election campaign."
Congratulations to all farmers 
I long to wait for your video... Thank you so much all your hard work and being voice to the great Indian farmers andolan.... Once our dictatorship regime gets over... All godi will be shut but NDTV and Wire and many such channels will like a morning star
A big thanks to Rajat Sain and Roohani  this reel will glorify the Flowers of our India  and all other countries Punjabis and kissans
I heard farmers & government 
"Those who understand cold chain knows that this is the only future. It's similar to the way that right now air India is sold back to Tata, Indian govt. meddled in many things during 20th century which they shouldn't have meddled with this is one of those thing, APMC just did one thing that's to improve life of few farmers from a specific state.. "
16k  such people watched the video who are not dependent on farmers for their food
Our PM cannot pull such crowd any time but farmer's unity for justice has broken the record.
"if it was congress rule now ,history would repeat itself but modi is too kind"
This is the first time you spoke about farm laws modiji. Desh sub dekh raha hai
Lol. Your father gave suggestions.  But yet 10000 farmers in Punjab committed suicide in Akali dals time ...
its shameful for us that we are having such leaders. it would probably take 2-3 minutes to completely remove barigating and march upto rashtrapati bhavan. Its the kindness of these people that they are not doing anything . Its the agenda of polititians to poke farmers in a hope that they will do something and godi media will make a move out of it.
Taliban dont touch India for read the word of god dont steer your army god soldiers in harm way listen to your lord god amen
Finally a geniune report about the farmers protest! Thanks Vice news
"Farmers issue has gone too long  and  Congress and other parties taking mileage out of it , as a farmer myself   And n kernels we prefer  option  to sell out products where ever we want,  I think middle man sponsoring the agitation."
We always with farmer
"To some extent the procurement policy of FCI is responsible for lower prices of grains in open market...if they could ensure smooth procurement and timely payment of dues to the farmers, the market price could have remained marginally above the MSP. FCI could then sell the excess grain in open market after booking some profit. Besides this, more categories of MSP for a grain is needed in consonance with the variety of the produce. FCI may also think of value addition and may itself become a supplier to the corporate. FCI solely for the purpose of PDS is a very bad idea."
"I agree with all of this. But then, why are the demands put up by the representatives of our farmers to the Government totally unrelated to these issues?"
"India in deep trouble, human rights are being violated *Farmers are unhappy*  pk"
Now a days farmers condition is improving  Due to Modi ji they are getting direct benefits.Middle men like Tiket are worried.This is politically motivated and funded movement.
who all want a India Media vs Savage Trevor Noah
Its not hard. Respect democracy. Repeal the 3 bills. Simple.
Every political party had these laws in their manifesto at one time or the other. And these are good laws for the farmers and the country. 
"Did you get all this wisdom after the bills are repealed, or have you made any video before suggesting your favorite leader what to do"
"I just want to thank you Sir for not being bias and bringing the truth for the viewer like us, as i was looking for this info on so many platform and everywhere i found out that either i have to be BJP or Congress supporter to listen their one sided argument, and i can't tolerate either of it ;)"
"Dear Modi ji , YOU distroyed every Economy Fields."
What the Indian Govt. does to stop flow of arms into Punjab?
"So, if only 5% of farmers use APMC in the first place - why are farmers protesting the fact that markets outside of APMC will stop getting taxed?"
India owes you a lot Ravish ji
We did not brought law overnight but we never consulted with farmers about law because it wasn't necessary....
First of all my sincere respect and support to farmers
Zee news shame to India
Police support bjp
Kisan hate to Yogi-Modi bhi hate.
"So you proud  to  modi asking sorry to farmers  come forward  himself  for farmers, and he should be win  UP"
Are farmers celebrating republic day?
Why this slow version video instead actual version? The Actual version is worse attack on innocent farmers.
We farmers oppose this antifarmer. Bill
May our farmers be blessed...
"Sir, I think you are taking these farm bills very positively. But do you think things work this way on the ground? Fact is if buyer is going to decide price even before farmer produces crop then MSP automatically becomes Max Selling Price! If your question is How ; then just think, corporates and politicians has better control over who can reach farmers and % deals among them will become more legal .. please dont look at only positive side of law, India need laws which are leak proof .. I hope I am making some sense. Please react to my opinion."
This was a rich farmer's agitation. 
The guy in green turban is correct....We r with our farmer's....Jai Jawan Jai kissan
"2nd law: Suppose if there is heavy rain (or any other natural disaster)  and the quality of the crops are not that good, then sponsors (companies) can refuse to take corps. And even these companies will ask the money back from farmers which they provided for cultivation and this cycle will make a farmer slave of these companies. If a sponsored company will bankrupt in future and other company refused to take that crop then what a farmer will do. And famers are not allow to go to court. "
BJP leaders arrange Rural areas campaign for creating awareness in detail with farmers. Local language needed for such farm acts which farmers can understand
Lots of love Dhruv bhaiyya for supporting India farmers
I'll support the farm bills if anyone can explain how the govt is going to handle all of the below listed points (copied from a fb post). I still won't support the way govt treated the protesting farmers (over 160 died in 2 months while on protest)  -
Modiji's government has been out of action since Shaheen Baug days and this time All his voters and the country finally lost.
all people protest against EVM all problems come from EVM ban EVM never come again BJP Indian poor people are happy
These guys aren't listening to farmers but look at the bandobas they done and how much can this all has been cost...??
These are just positive PR & Marketing strategies by Modi because of upcoming elections
Now time to accept the blunder of Sikh leaders in the time of Partition to join India..............but we still support you and want a peaceful  buffer zone (Khalistan)  between Pakistan and India to normalize the relations of both countries  ......love of Punjabi for other side
- Delhi's people are suffering? At least they get to go home and sleep in peace. Is Delhi facing more problems than farmers on road?
In Pakistan when people are feel to see comedy show they are watching tarik fath show I am teling all Indian brothers and sisters  this person have 0 knowledge about Pakistan Afghanistan
We are protecting our nation not our agriculture only . If these agriculture laws will apply then the first impact will on metropolitan cities.     Farmers of Punjab and Haryana are educated nd captivated.
Reform is the crying need of time with slight changes which govt is also trying to modify but rejecting the bill is going to push farmers in same gutterwhere we will say ki lays to 10 me 2 aloo deta hai aur bechare kisaan 1 kilo ke 5 ka benefit hota hai.  Peace 
Support for farmers protest
"Please show the whole video , when that is running over the farmers"
Not only u explained farm bills u also taught about business stratergies..
"T - 6 months - going by bjp's latest hijacked lineage, a riot 6 months ahead of elections is expected. Usually it would be against ""transporting beef"" or keeping 200 gms of mutton in fridge or a hindu girl marrying a non hindu man etc. This time they got an easier enemy - the farmer. Its a little late this time, usually this would be done in September. Anyway i am happy that bjp didnt break its legacy and hige expectations of people like me. Welcome to the new world created by social media, fired by human's oldest virtue - gossiping and rumour mongering. Be it, somebody wearing mask or somebody eating beef or somebody marrying somebody - the mad crowd can easily generate an interest in that matter and that can be controlled by dubious politicians who appeared to have dedicated their entire life for ""bharat mata""!!!"
It is very bad day for india..bjp is right
"your work is commendable. so genuine video i have seen on the internet today. As far as i believe for every problem of the farmers , there is a solution given by the govt. lets see what will happen ?"
Thank you for covering farmers
Ratkesh tiket bhawisyafal    up election 2022   .....00  seats
People of India our farmers need us now let's support them. We cannot survive without food
But these rich punjab farmers earned lot of money.. just came for vacation...
That's why punjab government is protesting in the name for farmers 
I belive out of my Rs 30 aleast Rs 15 should go to the farmer
become independent .Rich farmers ' struggle is for preserving their vested interests. Sadly new Farm Laws were  also being given a communal colour .Govt in Punjab is also controlled by these very influential Rich farmers' lobby.
Thanku ndtv for covering this news  other channels are playing dirty politics and hiding the facts standing against farmers .. really appreciate that you guys are doing your honest part  .. where these days all the mainstream media channels have sold themselves to modi government and misleading the facts spreading fake news or ignoring the reality  .. im sure all the farmers and true indians will always appreciate your channel and support you .. 
"Beautiful, since long I was waiting for this beautiful. Going to share it with my friends and family but 2/3 things you have smartly ignored. 1 Govt tax. On farmers and middleman. 2. Employment created by Pvt players. 3. Formalising the farm/agriculture economy. These are huge factors. Thats why I support this Farm bill."
Bhiya salute and lots of love to your hard work and efforts.. Godi media will never explain this..
"I also read about the laws.  I don't find anything wrong for my farmer brothers. However, there are journalists like Ravish kumar who used to command some respect among intellectuals, they are also behaving foolish. Seriously worrying trend."
NDTV Unbiased news channel...Other channels will call farmers anti-national... government should talk to them and try to address their problems.
"What a hypocrisy and liar, telling only small segment of farmer failed to understand their enlighten laws for farmers betterment. What a sick man still glorifying himself and his sick policies. Never Again."
CONTRACTUAL FARMING ( for any issue farmers can reach only to SMC AND DC of the district)
Mere Dil m apki aur bhi respect ho gyi...yeh video viral hgi abthanx for supporting us bro...we all love uKisan Ekta Zindabadh
I can see misleaded farmers on road...who don't have understanding about what is right for him in only for short term but also in long term....
4- if it is prevent exploitation of farmers by bicholia why no intervention of civil courts for grievance handling?
"Bakwas drama, all for just your survival. Go support farm laws if you want upliftment of farmers."
"So called protesting farmers are like that really annoying aunty who will criticize you even when you are right... Ironically only opposition leader's fb profile had the farmers protest logo with them.. farmers had no problem but opposition has. So on a sad note, now that laws are getting repealed only farmers will suffer and not opposition "
Remember 120 million farmers in India .
"I dont agree with the decision, but we have no other alternative. Modiji is only our hope!"
"Half of the country works in agriculture. I feel for these farmers who have likely been on single family small farms for generations, but the reality is that shouldnt be sustained in the 21st century when more efficient options for the country as a whole are available. If you look at the farmers decreasing share of wealth by GDP its mostly not because they are getting poorer its because all the other sectors are getting richer as they continue to industrialize/innovate. In the short term it may be hard to believe, but in the long term what the government is doing is probably for the best of all of them."
"Rubika is good in  justifying, BJP should send her to make the farmers understand."
2. you spoke about MSP . In the Mandi system only 6% of the farmers were benefited with MSP or only 6% of them sold their crops at MSP price or above. (stastics from Sharada committee  
Neither useful for farmers nor customers. Jus a corporate look for middle man system. Thats it.
No this is not justified!! Farmers have no right to do this especially on Republic day!!
I am not totally agree with your comment that export if on I an to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. But onion is   very commonly  used by poor people in Hindi belt . If onion prices goes up in India because India wants to keep up its commentmwnt to export when our own people are suffering due covid 19 no income to spend freely then it is not the responsibility of our Govt to protect owen  people.
This time we watch tractor rally of farmers....the real republic Day rally
farmers go home make india great again
Shame on farmer leader and shame on Khalistanis..
all the three acts are in the favour of farmers..protesters are the middle man and they are not against the act rather they are against the farmer..
Farmer is like an another solder of India who is feeding us. Police is throwing stone on them. Its not fair
So happy to hear that farmers won
One day .. citizens n farmers of India can understand ur point of view .. we r with u Modi Sir 
It's not all about selling the produced commodity but how poor people going to buy it when the price go skyhigh
Respected prime minister  Modi ji immediate withdrawal farmers against New three law. Don't waste off time . Former strike it created comen public side   your government administration conditions  unsatisfaction.  this situation definitely effect coming Tamil Nadu assembly election. so immediate solve farmers laws . Otherwise yours  government nothing to win comming election.
Godi media channels are not showing it
"3. According to old farm law, states were allowing middle men who were monopolised to which only, farmers can sell their produce. These middle men were enjoying legalised monopoly in such a way that, they are the single possible buyer from farmers in their geographical areas."
KYA AB FARMERS TALVAAR NAI MAAR SAKTA ??  UPLOAD A VIDEO OF YOU EXPLAINING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON RDAY 2021 IF YOU HAVE THE GUTS
Why was mainly Punjab and Sikhs were offended by the farm reforms ?
"You Sir are learned and know very well the irrigation demand of rice and wheat. If you artificially keep the prices of these commodities high, the repercussions will be felt in the coming years. High prices of these commodities will act as a deterrent for the farmers to rotate the crop cycle and you very well know sir how thirsty paddy and wheat crops are. It not only endangers our economy but also the ecosystem."
And then this policy was launched without first consulting the stake holders ( farmers and their leaders ) where while taking their fears or apprehensions in mind a better law could have been incorporated with a firm long term plan in place where crop diversification would be put in place and a subsidy provided by the centre for a fixed number of years while the transition is in place.
Congrats farmers
These people are not just farmers; they are fighters. They are fighting since the time of great Ranjit Singh. Mighty British could not defeat their moral.  Salute to them.
tbh my family is farming based family we dont find anything wrong in this bill kyuki we farmers from UP only sells sugarcane as we sell it directly to factory!!! 
"Two of my cousins are farmers by choice and are supportive of this law, but the unfortunate situation is:"
You make us crying dear   !!  Seeing is believing    after 1984  sikhs was portrayed  as separatist  or khalistanis  bcz of the media wasn't  showing  the real pictures  !now this generation  has seen what kind of peoples are these 3% who always stood for INJUSTICES  whether its on them or someone's  else  this is a teachings of our gurus
LoL even during the 1992 economic liberalisation there were protest by the people who love socialism it was just that indian industrial work force was pathetically small due to colonialism and  socialism. If these bills are taken back then it will be the continuation of the India's sick farming sector.
Ultimately Farmers Will Suffer. Climate will be Harm and Water level will deplit. Now Farmer Of This Punjab have no right to blame anyone but themselves.
Hope farmers don't meet the same fate.
"You cannot stop tha farmers ,,, I'm proud of my country's farmers"
"Why does the government not provide MSP on other types of crops? Why MSP is provided on crops like wheat only? Is there any reason behind that? If MSP is provided on other types of crops, I think it may encourage our farmers to produce different kinds of crops other than wheat. This will reduce the over-supply of wheat and hence reduce the wastage of wheat getting rotten in storage facilities. There must be some logical reason behind this."
"This government of course has a brute majority in parliament.  But on the whole quiet a lot of people genuinely think, many of the top governmental functionaries lack the much needed sophistication and grace. The people are also a lot frustrated with constitutional organs like the judiciary who are often perceived as siding with the ruling party rightly or wrongly.  What the government should understand is that the negative politics being bombarded on the Indian polity by the BJP today has a limit and there should be proper governance transcending the mediums of caste and creed. The rulers in a democracy must be humble and going roughshod over farmers who feed the country is not good politics."
I have a doubt Bihar say mandi system 2006 me abolish hua and we all know the situation there but Punjab and Haryana me abhi bhe hai and people migrate to Punjab from Bihar to work as labours why? Is mandi really that bad? Also dude near my place there is government storage facility of wheat and trust me its rats haven and most of shit is rotten.
Why is Rajdeep not talking about these so called farmers who were wearing Bhindranwale shirts? Which farmers were Bhindranwale supporters? This is all a ploy to create instability in country!
Only reason to repeal is upcoming election 
"Jai mulnivasi Jai bheem Jai Tipu Sultan Jai Kisan, morcha ke sath hit counter code of conduct for PM r Reader go head with love and life election commission"
"Owaisi is great ,he will surely support Hindu rashtra"
"Who will buy American Apples for $5 if Indian Apples are available for $2 ? To prevent this from happening and Losing Monopoly, Foreign Nations are fuding these Fraudulent Protests to keep India backward and India's Agricultural sector stalled. This is why you see Global support from Rihanna, Greta, All Backed by International elements etc. Without knowing this, Some people foolishly support these Protests."
Now I don't support farmers protest
Jo v hota h achhe ke liye hota hai..you guys are fighting not only for farmers but for india
Ye sb ka Responsible government khud h apne to maze me baithi aur police aur Farmers k bich ladai ladwa rahi h aisa Farmers bill me Amendment nhi karni chahiye
Modi govt done best work in favour of Farmers .
"This doesnt even cover the protests themselves, which are maligned by the government and the national media. Mispotrayed as insurrectionists, when they arent even asking for that. Then they say its only two states, when that is far from the truth. People have been beaten as far as rajasthan and bihar and stymied from participating. The local police themselves cause agitations, and then use that excuse to perform extrajudicial kidnappings/torture. The mass population who watch national media, get an alternate reality."
Proud of the farmer brothers and sisters.
owasi is a original indian muslim politician
Home minister of UP should resign for justice in this incident. He may resume post after justice is delivered to farmers.
"As you talked about about the control phase of corporatization, that regulations have to be mandated for selling agricultural produce, can't we access the process which Starbucks does with coffee beans farmers?"
When an area is given for farmers to protest why there was need to come forward to other places. It was a great law and order situation. Last time when farmers came some infiltrators  hoisted Kalistani flag. And hurt the police officers. This is totally law and order situation. Police are protecting us and people should respect them too. Beating and hurting police officers in the name of protest is no good. They are hurting our own people.
"Hi bisbo, I am from Telangana, our cm announced that 4000 to all farmers including one with 1000 acres but not giving that to land lease farmers and giving to land owners during Nizam period, there were many zamindars but people and naxsalites taken Thier land and started farming this scheme is to legalize the land of zamindars and give it back to them and to smash the old records of farmers who taken the land from zamindars he is computirizing them"
"2:16 open auctions with transparent pricing this is the whole issue. Neither the auctions are open nor the pricing transparent. The arthias (dealers) group up in each mandi and decide a common highest bid, above which no other arthia will go. Ground reality is very different then theory. The arthias are bullies. And their is no real oversight in the mandis. The people who are meant to actually overlook the functioning of mandi and protect the farmers do the exact opposite. They team up with the arthias or more precisely, they issue the arthia license only to their family members/relatives to gain monopoly over the market."
We're very Sorry Modiji being from Farming Community I hate being a Farmer in INDIA besides Dirty Politics 
Good morning my dear brother arbind kajeriwal. Ji  please help all farmers please god bless you
Waheguru ji bless all farmers  
"There are 2 types of farmers: one who are angry youth and want Khalistan because someone surely provoked them. Others, who were mislead by these people. Real farmers dont really have time to protest."
Aj jo innocent farmers hai unka Jo agenda tha...bht Jada dilute krdia gya....local political leaders and other hooligans destroying their motive and converting it to their motive.... Sad that we saw such an incident on 26th January.
"Even I support farmers I belong to farmers family,but whole world is polarised and everyone shows what suits thr ideology. Truth is now just a version of individual."
SUGGESTION TO SOLVE FARM BILL 2020 ISSUE:
Thank you lallantop . And shame on godi media
"The media will never cover the full story... Just the clash... Never the pains of the farmers, old, young, men, women, every farmer is there..... Who likes to be violently splashed with cold water in winters??? Not me !!not these farmers!! These are poor people who just realised their power and right in unity....!! May God help them  fulfilling their noble..... purpose!!"
The government should not yield to such arm twisting tactics by this MINISCULE MINORITY of the Indian population. Farmers are over-pampered with various concessions and subsidies. Giving back very little to the consumers.
then if state govt increase in tax for new mandies which will covered (get)  as indirectly from farmers.
"Farmer's leader= we don't need any changes or improvements in agriculture,we are happy with our condition."
"2:20 I would like to point out that the Govt will not need to take out the APMC brick by brick. Sir the issue here is that the corporates have a certain financial backing with which they can provide a price slightly hire than APMC for a couple of years (3-4  years lets assume). Farmers will therefore sell to these corporates at higher prices and no procurement will occur through mandis. This will effectively drain the mandis of the mandi tax and mandis will eventually fall into ruins by themselves. In the 5th year when the corporate silos will be already full due to excess procurement in the previous years ( farm production of wheat, paddy has always been greater than consumption for many years now), the corporates may choose not to buy at all or buy at very lower prices, and the option of mandis at that point in time may not be available at all. I hope this gets the point across"
What about And what's the difference the proposal of Dr Manmohan Singh then finance minister in 1991 and the present farmers bill.That time BJP opposed the proposal and that proposal became silent .It should also be studied and discussed .
Farmers are fighting for country
First they are not farmers because in democratic countrie you can protest but this kind of  
"One truth was said by the cop (afsar) from a farmer's parivar.  Explains the village mentality that city cops have about women, young couples and night life in general."
6. The Adthi can also become a private company. They will buy the crop from the farmers.
5: is this protects  still really  done by farmers?. I variously  doubt  it.
"Meghnad has been quite fair to the proposed laws. Contract farming itself had been recommended by MS Swaminathan. The point is that since some of these reforms have already been tried out and didn't work out as expected, coz you know, the world is not ideal, doubts regarding their implementation and discussion of steps (with stakeholders) required to correct them are pending. The way the govt went about this is so undemocratic and farmers are clearly unconvinced is the problem with this. Last I checked, India is not an authoritarian state as per its constitution. Remember folks bold does not necessarily equate to wise."
"How pathetic these people are in comments, saying ""we support farmers"" just by seeing this video, well done india "
With farmers ..
"WHY congress, TMC, samajwadi party is against BJP!!! and all this incidents are happeneing before election? Think for yourself!!!!"
*The only thing we can do it is* just wait for next election without forgetting these events which is destroying our India.
CONGRESS QUIT BHARAT THAT IS NOW INDIA. GANDHI FAMILY QUIT INDIA.
Its a proud moment of our farmers it was Made a history Proud to be a daughter of a farmer  Congratulations to all farmers my grands and my lovely brother and sisters 
Indian Farmers Should be definitely taught About this bill
Why dont you get Farmer from Punjab to speak????
Great job students  please use social media to spread farmers voice to the world
Yes sir you are supporting so much to farmers .keep it up.and government have no right to go against farmers . As they should see farmers wish and .agree what farmers say.
Why only hindi speaking farmers are protesting?
I support farmers I stand with farmers
Well I support for farmers but a flag agnist indian flag is completely different thing
South indian is like other country to modi we did not get any benefits
So in fake congress farmers protest someone was crushed
Farmers are given full freedom to sell their products to any one of their choice.
"The government's surrender to a small group of corrupt middlemen has set the template that would now be used for every progressive reforms that India needed and I personally felt very sad, the way our  Prime Minister Narendra Modi apologised even for such revolutionary  reforms in the field of farming and heartfelt condolences for such real farmers who are really in need for such laws.."
The farmers are adamant...not ready to come to a compromise..especially the farmers from Punjab....they are arrogant..basically they more rich than farmers from other states..
"If this bill is passed. Adani and another big player will make big storage units to control prices. In the long run because of the removal of JAMAKHORI ACT the prices of grain will increase a lot and normal people will suffer and the poor even more. So its not just a bad thing for wheat and rice farmers, is it bad for everyone, other than few billionaires"
Why in India giving so much syphathy to farmers..agricultural same as business if they should understand what farm law how it's beneficial  to them...and farmer not selling any food to free...everyone paid for what they are eating...they are not farmers they congress Chelas....
"Now go and convince the BJP's against in the election and tell the public that remove BJP, save the country, save democracy.i salute to all farmers"
I think farm bill is good for farmers
Never in this history I have seen farmers like this...
IF U EAT FOOD THANKS A  FARMER............DONT BITE THE HAND THAT FEEDS U
Thnx BBC for support farmers
Kudos to those who are still supporting BJP.
"Good Presentation, Alex can you explain about Indian agricultural commodity markets, it is meant for hedging the risk and price discovery, but the farmers participation is very less. Can you explain the reasons"
Modiji is First honest primeminister who done wonderful job . Never seen such a intellgent prime minster of india in the history of India.
I hope farmers get the justice they deserve!
OMG ! Pardon me for voting BJP in the last elections on the behest of Badal Dal.
Some ppl are saying this are rich ppl not farmers ....
Rakesh Tiket is dramebaaz. He should be arrested& put in jail  for life imprisonment
Laws were not good sir..govt not even care about small section..  every farmer were  going against day by day.. that's why this step is taken...
"Well explained. I support these bills. Farmers are our gods, who provided food for us. They should be good always."
"10%rich farmers won over the 90%poor farmers.... today we saw, Democracy also manipulated by few"
"These Bills are good in theory but could be a disaster in reality (agreed). But then you go on tell the current regulation and scenario in theory and miss the implementation of them, the APMC and MSP implementation, which I would like to highlight"
"I'm not against the farmer's protest, I'm against those violent protestors."
Can you make this same topic again with the present updates because it is most important topic concerning democracy. India was lead by practical wisdom of common people..  So India was not affected badly by many international issues. I respect the wisdom of the farmers (housewives) and the people encounter realities regularly which academics will never understand.
We support farmers
"Modi can never help anyone except richest Indians. Good initiative, this should continue till PM resignation."
"Pakistani here, and I pass my heart and support to the Indian farmers. "
Shame on indian media
"This is the real picture  of profit and loss of three bills brought by the govt for the welfare of  farmers. No doubt  these three bills  are against of middle  men of mandies,who were going rich to rich and kissan were going  poor to poor."
"Farmers WERE, ARE & WILL BE the foundational & core asset of Indian Economy. So need to focus on empowering  & prospering our farming community to see the strong economy & growth of India  on the global platform."
Great victory for farmers. Proves any anti people move could be defeated..no matter how strong the government pretends to be.
Only police have the rights to use violence and batons against Farmers. Its a free country and so are farmers. They can use sticks too.
Plz became a video on 26 January 2020 with positive response of farmer
"5. Deregulation of food items? There is no deregulation of any commodity, because there was no regulation of any commodity. Regulation existed only on markets in order that markets facilitate proper weighment, proper price formation process. However despite the APMC regulation, even to this day, farmers are given bili chiti, white slips which are totally not transparent. Even after 55 years of APMC act, farmers are still receiving a very low price share out of the consumer rupee, because of market inefficiencies and market imperfections and several practices such as undercover sales, illegal deductions by merchants, exploitation of farmers in interlocked markets, cartels among merchants  depressing the prices and so on"
"Dhawan Sir,with all due respect, it is very sad to see you not mentioning the price what the farmers paid for this repeal. 1 year long( i.e 360 days almost just think of it sir,360!) , Around 700 farmer's died(some committed suicide leaving behind a suicide note hoping there step may persuade the government about the protest).. 700 farmers sir,700! Summers,winters,harsh rain,Police brutality,Water cannon,tear gases and what not??????!"
"....... unfortunately, our IAS officials and some political leaders also who prepare such attractive blueprints of so called reform bills have no idea of poverty, lack of resources, want of education,  want of computer internet technology, lack of logistics & paper/documents works with our Indian farmers, therefore, our Indian farmers ( unlike American farmers) are not at the requisite threshold of managing /marketing of their produce by themselves .... inevitably, under the circumstances our agro-marketting is successful as totally dependent on our Govt agencies ( existing system of Mandikaran);  however, in implemnting the so called new reform bills would be distrous as it will open all possible corrupt avenues for the private traders/middlemenn with all the wealth/perhaps even black money at their disposal who will rob the farmers and thereby kill the nation, because today, the Govt is able to have full control on procurement of the produce, and storage of  the surplus produce and its regulated distribution across the needy population of the country as well as regulating the exports and even free donation to the needy world, .... .... therefore, in India ( Unlike America as an example  discussed above in here) with these new so called reform bills of management of agro-produce it is definitely aimed at welcoming private/middlemen traders to buy and sell the produce which would definitely rob/deprive the farmers of profits and that would kill the nation as well, because our nation India/Bharat is comprised of smaller land holdings but by a huge population of small farmers who do not have the requisite threshhold to enable them to act/become private businessmen in managing/marketting their produce without middlemen ( either Govt agencies or private traders); our agro-marketting is surviving because of an intensive infrastructure  of procurement, storage, distribution in place with setting of price by the Govt, .... farmers feel secure with the Govt agencies in marketing aspects of their produce, while in case of private traders no one could secure our huge populace of small farmers with smaller holdings and small produce at respective individual farmer level .... only God will save the poor farmer and poor India .... as for as GDP is concerned if a major population of a nation ( farmers) are robbed ... then forget about GDP growth curves,called reform system system will be robbed by middlemenn instead; ...... i may be allowed to reemphasize / a repetition of a paragraph above in here, viz : "
Here comes the spokesman for Taliban in India
"They called us ( farmers ) KHALISTANI that united entire India , without any caste creed or sex "
In the long run this decision of repeal  will impose only negative consequences on the actual poor farmers.
"momentum to reforms lost, just like in 91, no govt will ever touch agriculture for a decade or two, the ones that have come from Punjab and rejoicing, soon will be faced with a dilemma when the water beneath their farms runs out (almost at critical levels) and a situation of acute drought is forced upon punjab and haryana due to the excess production of wheat and rice. the age old tradition of freebies to continue!! to the one's that are rejoicing in the comment section and saying BJP has lost, you have lost, our future gen. has lost, all leaders of all parties have enough money to live 7 lives abroad, the lower and middle income group will be left here to starve."
Like me  if u love  Modi ji as a Best Motivational speaker n as well as best comedian.
"The same fate happened to Australian farmers, deregulation of the dairy market in the 2000s with milk prices, the small size farms could not make ends meet against the big corporations who have dominance on pricing. From 88% in Victoria state in 1983 with deregulation in the 2000s to just 33 % now as dairy farms collapsed. Minimum Support Price also is not mentioned in the law bills, so it can turn too horrible for farmers."
"6. Overall to prevent spoiling food grown of nation either by road accident, Rain, Storage damage, transportation damage, pest, etc. Did any system found in past from now onward when this is read for all poor farmers or any at any corners of village Taluka District "
Now Farmers are losing their credibility.
"These are only few examples. Due to heavy losses, there are many farmer suicides in southern and central states.  "
"Both farmers and consumers, both are looser."
Poor mothers and sisters also the ones who feed us also on the road in the cold shame on the government stay strong indias farmers   
Sooner or later the laws are needed. Sorry the Jat farmers are not able to understand the laws.
i fully stand with the farmers
"Secondly, the cost of our produce  wheat, rice and sugar - to mention few is higher than the prevalent international prices. The landed cost of wheat at our ports from say Australia or Canada is lower than the cost of wheat transported from north India to south. The high price-tag as fixed by MSP, despite low labour costs, is due to higher cost of agro-inputs such as fertilizer (despite subsidy), cost of fuel such as diesel, agro-chemicals, agro-equipment. However, these issues remain unattended."
Big farmers are also partners in mandi (APMC)
"ITC makes partnership with the farmers in the same way, and the farmers are too happy, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, UP are the areas ITC is focusing, but those in the Singhu border are making fake issues, what do they get from this"
Police should have some shame getting paid by the tax payer and still beating Farmers who produce food.
" Don't allow these  Ambanis and Adanis or whomever you hate, to enter punjab. Even if they come, don't do business with them. I mean the farmers of Punjab are so united, (we all see that daily) if farmers decide that no matter what happens, under no circumstances are we going to deal with Private players, then to sab waise hi chalega jaisa chal raha hai na. "
Plzzz stay with the farmers...
Condemning 26 violence (farmer police included) shame godi media!!
"Kindly give your attention to this issue also as it is highly related to the life of farmers ,  jamindars and land owners ."
"Can someone who understands this bill completely tell me why only the farmers of Haryana and Punjab are protesting while farmers from Maharastra, Mp, Up, and many others don't have a problem with this bill. Is this bill in some way affecting farmers of only these two states?? Or this bill only applies to some type of harvest which is predominantly grown in these two states. Pls don't give any political answers. Reply only if you have some valuable insights. Thx"
We always support farmers  
"BJP government are doing wrong, this is Indian farmers not terrorist"
"I agree with Shrees perspective, Modis decision to repeal Farm Laws there must be many more reasons "
One minute silence for those who doesn't read farm bills and make a decision 
"This is one of the biggest protest in recent history. Already 75 days have passed. 160 farmers  already died. So, it is natural that there will be world wide attention."
"ye kisaan akele nahin hain....""WO BHI HAIN JO IN FARM BILLS KA SUPPORT KARTIEN HAIN""....These Laws are good for the farming.....Reforms are needed..."
Kisans may have problems with the govt...but simple thing very straight forwardly closing borders is not good and Delhi govt on one hand is against pollution but on other hand supporting tractor rally may increase pollution and congestion....rally could have been avoided....
"This is inhumane,cruel and insane  act on farmers...,Rest those souls in peace...,.Yes,but the real question is will the culprit be punished for murders..."
Very Good.  Great  Rakesh Tikait Ji
Meanwhile the Guardian and BBC are so busy covering stories of India.. India gifted 3.2 doses of vaccines...Yes farmers protest is of higher priority but when did Western Media look at priorities over facts
Godi Media may not cover this story
We hope and pray that Taliban takes over pakistan too. Inshallah.
"Our farmers are facing inconvenience sitting on roads for last few months in such cold , rain with their kids  and people who are eating at their homes still criticising them, shame on such rubbish people"
When few businessmen run the country and a wellfare state starts to act like a broker to business entities then this happens.. Standing with farmers..
"aren't these laws actually supporting the farmers then? if the leading cause of death of farmers acc to the government is financial duress, then doesn't it this indicate that income should increase by connecting buyers directly to farmers...what am I not getting here?... for all I know, the people protesting are the wealthy middlemen depriving the farmers of better income..."
It's a straight forward thing that if the law is made for farmers and they donot it is much sensible to take those laws back.
Modi BJP will sale all root and institution on one men BJP sponsorship.
"These are the farmers of our country whose demands the government was unable to fulfill and they decided to carry out peaceful protests from the very start, the group who hoisted that flag separated itself from the peaceful tractor rally, moving towards the red fort was led by deep siddhu, farmers claim that going to the red fort was not even in their plan"
Best video for those who really want to understand farmers protest
If the government is in favour of our farmers.. That is the three law is not harmful to them then it should be proved by effecting step and realised the farmers that all are in their favour or remove the law by which everything will be okay... Otherwise the farmers who take such will never come back... and the situation may be very harmful
"Modiji is the best, Im a farmer enthusiast with mbbs ms(general surgery ) degree, and I support farmers bill. NDTV is the worst news channel ever"
Support Farmers Protest 
"the graphics are confusing. and I wonder how the landlords fit into this picture - as I understand it, most farmers pay rent for use of their land."
"This legitimisation and romanticizatin of divisive politics is an insult to Hindu, Muslim and Sikhs"
Actual video is of 45 sec and it's clearly visible that the cheep hitting farmer has a broken windscreen on driver side that means visibility was zero ans the people who attacked the jeep came into seen after 28th second fully armed with rods and swords. It was pre planed and now court enquiry will bring the truth. Watch the video again and again and to ican clearly see the smashed windscreen of the jeep hitting the farmer ...who attacked this jeep
Farmer law should leave on the decision of state government.
If farmers stop farming there will food emergency just like in Sri Lanka .V.Bad adminstration by BJP.
Abhijit is an effective critique when it comes border strategies and technical analysis. He is an effective haemorrhoid that irritates some well deserved orifices where the sun doesnt shine. But in this issue I am glad Modiji is PM and Abhijit is an opinionated talking head.
Like to know was not farmers allowed to sale its crop outside the apmc market if found a good deal before this bill?
"It is just a matter of time. BJP has already lost Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand and parts of UP. People do not trust BJP at all here."
Very nice explained.  The bill is not good for farmers
"Modi ji is not a dictator as someone has told here but people of India need to understand that this country has be sold out for 70 years , today it needs to be governed by an able leadership & that is modi ji"
Listen dude if you guts to reply. In bihar APMC monopoly ended in 2006. Has situation improved in bihar. Farmers sell at half the MSP in Bihar as per facts
Why are the farmers of punjab and haryana in particular protesting ????
"court, police, power is to dominate hindu, but for rakesh tikait everything is possible in Riad"
2- if it is to protect Farmer why no MSP?
Farmers are farmer not terrorist
"This pseudo farm protest is up against our beloved PM, the democratically elected govt, but aayega to Yogi ( 2022 ) and Modi (2024) hi.  Kuchh bhi kr lo salon desh ke gaddaron Khalistani gang."
Who is giving these so called poor farmers money for protesting since last 10 months
There is no corruption in Punjab and haryana against farmers....
"1. THE FARMERS PRODUCE TRADE AND COMMERCE (PROMOTION AND FACILITATION) BILL, 2020"
"Awesome straight forward explanation like jalebi and u literally said that now farmers should have to educate enough to right terms and conditions.. wow & now straight to the point, it doesn't look like that u r against the bill just make this video to convince people that bill is actually good for farmers... and it shows   in the starting of the video when u said that who already sets  their perspective about this farming bill don't have to watch video. My English is not too good but i tried that who ever read this can understand in easily ."
Thank u ....thanku u for such questions to the bjp spokesperson...kindly keep this kind of spirit...plz dont go against our farmers
"I feel Modi-shah did good thing..If they didnt revoke, opposition only speak this and pass missinformation ....Poor farmers may vote for Anti-national elements.. It good wise decision   (  I came from farming background family and still we are doing farming (my family and I was very angry on tha t day)"
These warehouse owner will make farmers wait until they crush buying price and then they will wait until they sky high the selling price!!
"Russia,China,Pakistan officially Taliban ko support kar diya.."
"At that point of dispute, the loser would be obviously the small farmer. He has no wherewithal  to fight the mighty corporates. "
"The new laws do have the potential to improve the financial  condition of farmers( IMF Chief economist Gita Gopinath had too said this ), but has it's own loopholes which can be misused against the farmers. "
as every bill has a some pots and holes this bill too has it...but regardless of all that i think i would help farmers indeed in globalising their products...and they would not be just confined to APMC but to global market...so lets see how it goes
Kick out Achedin Terrorist Govt....Jai Kisan
Spinelessness of Indian media at its peak
"I have watched so many videos on this, but by far, this is the best explanation for all three farm bills. Kudos!"
"BJP Is full of arrogance, Yogi is a failure , Yogi should resign, Modi should resign"
Then these law can be implemented by state government. That will help the state eventually and that state could become a role model of prosperous farmers
Good going. Support farmers. One day everything will be better bcoz God is watching. It's a very long protest ever in the Universe seen. Kisan union zindabad 
Present youth should learn from our great fighters our farmers
"This bill is not about farmer but hits the middleman, who are the leaches in our system and have a very powerful lobby and opposition party supports."
It just teaches one thing that never waive  small farmers loan even if they do suicide because they are the one who supported politically backed famers
"Rahul gandhi is fearless against BJP & modi, but BJP & modi are afraid of him. Because of that BJP has paid media, social media to damage his image. But still he is fighting..."

Punjab farmers has save india from acute hunger and now it is time for entire India take a stand for India farmers.
As always govt is befooling farmers to satisfy their own political and corporate interests
"May be tactical decision by PM to re-launch bill again with certain modification after election,as voiced by BJP MP's, Ministers "
Brilliant explanation. Very sad that the bills have been withdrawn. All loss to farmers and end consumer.
"I hope sincerely, that government listens to them in peaceful contact...and pray my farmer brothers to be patient and protest unless they are listened to, which I believe they will be listened to, they don't have other choice..."
Real fact :New farm Bill make Farmers daily labours and migrants in coming days. Salute to the farmers who braved the winters & cruelty of government.
"Farmers Never believe   Commitment of Feku , he is 420 about his commitment , we seen so many times . After bill pass only stop this protest ."
Tumhi to bjp ko 2014 me support kiye the
"Bro, if Govt. wants to get out of Agri businesses, then what's the guarantee that the farmers will get protected from or out of these  bills..!!"
Why farmers required weapons
These are not Farmers these are goons
Proud of every farmer and every voice that speaks for it
"Ur video is just like""Small packet big bang""it really make my all concepts related to this farm bill clear nd also make me able to ponder about the reasons why farmers are protesting. "
shame on you government. Farmers are fighting for their rights. Farmers are honest loyal
i hope Pakistan-taliban break this mental slavery in Pakistan too!!
Why this law was the problem only for Punjab farmers?
"MP, UP & RAJASTHAN are also joining PUNJAB &  HARYANA. Punjab started it and they all gonna end it up. "
Zee news to modi media hey
We are the ones who gonna buy food produced by farmers 
Thank you for support our farmers
"Good video but does not explain everything. Abhi create one more follow up video with 3 parts with each part focusing on 3 issues on the bill. To understand the farm bill you need to understated the history of Indian agriculture for last 30 to 40 years. Most people putting comments were not even born then. P. Saianth  was invited by Supreme court  to be part of expert panel to resolve this issue. He declined the supreme court saying he would not want to be a ""party to death"" by any panel formed to resolve the crisis. He did that as he knows that the panel being formed wont do anything for farmers. It will be just like any other panels that have been formed before. If Supreme court invited him, he is qualified to speak on the issue. I suggest that you listen to him as he knows the history of Indian agriculture better than most of people."
Finally BJP learnt few things from Congress...
There is no reason for farmers not to be in control of their own crops
"The whole story is not shown here, why are you doing like this quint. They look like Khalistanis not farmers."
So shocking that the farmers had to go through this.
I don't think credit goes to amrinder singh all the credit goes to the farmers
70yrs of congress rule Abjit you want Modiji to correct within 7yrs...who is he a magician.
Ye national security ke chalte decision Liya but sad about the farmers
decision could be made by our super hero's(farmers). In other hand government could represent there work from the insurance 
Here Government want to make a law for Farmer which was rejected by the farmer.
Indians love and follow this intellectual. Would that Pakistan had such an intellectual. Love from Pakistan
No Government is working for Farmers
I know it's very hard to farm like in this time but you are throwing india flag like this shame on you punjabi
"1. If FCI is carrying grain worth 1.8 lakh crores and not able to sell, how is the farmer expected to sell this to corporates?"
Punjab saved Indian Democracy once again.
"This will be the big turning point. Modi's days are near. This is a Revolution, which was most required. Women coming on the streets is a victorious protest. Keep it up #Women of India you are the pillars "
Don't worry Rakesh ticket yogi Ji Modi ji BJP 300 plus plus plus

Fear of UP Punjab elections
"And BTW farmers are not only in Punjab Haryana, they are present in every corner of our country. So stop calling this a farmer's protest and rename this as ""Khalistani"" riots. #referandum_2020"
"Rakesh Takait has contested assembly and loksabha elections before, he lost both elections. He got a  irrelevent issue to start a agitation. Most of these laws already existed. He has consciously  taken the support of Khalistanis & other anti nationals to make it deadly."
Were the farmers in the first few weeks ready to talk to the Government?
Thank a lot and salute to Mr Ajit anjum it's your victory aswell . victory of true jurnalism .kisan jindabaad . Proud to b a farmer.
We can see only Punjab farmers since 2 months of protest ?? Why ist so ? Its hijacked from Khalistan protestors.
What a beautiful story !! Is this the same india ? Our Nation is changing  God bless our kisan 
What are the issue in the farm bill can anyone help me???
Khalistanis removed our national flag and we are supporting them?? You should have acted like Rajeev Gandhi
BJP is doing big drama these days. Begs votes in the name Taliban and Pakistan but jaishankar made a meeting with Taliban last month. BJP thought they will make lot of money by investing in Afghanistan from its lithium reserves. But now 3 billion Indian money is put into dustbin....!!!!
Why to have elections when we can frame laws or repeal from roads...dissolve all parliament and let some brokers and opposition decide what to do
ALL THE HONEST AND SINCERE PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD SUPPORT THE LEGITIMATE MOVEMENT OF THE FARMERS.
Don't defend the farmers by saying they are not farmers.
"Aaj tak is a reputed channel and they should not invite fool people like rakesh tikait , iski baato me koi logic nahi hota hai. Kisano ke liye govt kuch aacha kare to isko prob , aur nahi kare to bhi isko prob .."

Farmers are the backbone of India and now it's time show solidarity for them.
Me with the farmers of my country
"It is always a perfect vision in hindsight. I am sure the govt will learn too. When you Look at the number of tough laws which have been passed and implemented, I do not regret one of their calculations having gone wrong. I feel that the democracy is upheld by repealing, even though it may not be in best interest of farmers."
Lack of knowledge from farmers side cant be blamed on government. They should fight for themselves of laws are made for them
this was a great insight into Taliban's history. Thanks Ravishji. At least someone asks the right question with a will to know and enlighten. And thanks to Mr. Ray for sharing such stories in a such a short period.
"Farmer sowed seed, God Jesus n bible is a seed of god's word satisfied ur soul by His death n ressurrection. C 'Bible' in google!!!......."
There is a concerted effort by Godi Media and GOI agencies to not show the depths and seriousness of this protest. So ordinary citizens across India has not understood the gravity of situation for farmers - the hand that feeds Billions in India including the rich and common.
I am amazed when i see people still supporting BJP & Modi.
"We lack terribly in holding fort ourselves, in protecting family, friends, neighborhood, state, nation and the worlds sanctity. Lack of inclusion of culture and ethics in our teachings, under the guise of secularism, this allows us to easily fall prey to any sort of lure and we in turn try to find appeasement in search of alternatives in looking for luxury and laze. Each child needs a healthy and strong mind, the lure of wealth need not move him/her. The best way a child learns, I hear is by aping. So the owness falls on the shoulders if the parents, which means that parents have to follow the path if righteousness. This is easy to say, i am aware. We have to stop fraudulent and easy lifestyle and stop falling prey to all sorts of appeasement. It's difficult but let's all pledge to begin. One Modi cannot bring about the much required change, we need to be good civilians, administrators, strong and upright armed forces, judiciary, all and sundry. Ready to lay our lives if required not only on our borders but also in our homes, neighborhoods, states and nations. With a target of a 'Vasudeva kutumbakam'. Don't you think that the little youtubers were already warning us of groups of people wanting to be and remain rich by controllingthe masses. We can already see our weak Indian structure easily falling down around us everyday. Not one desh bhakt was found ready to lay his life, without a thought of the consequences and not let any other flag be raized on the Lal Kila an Indian monument on Indian land. Shame on us Indians."
Supporter of farmers 
Pakistan is gloating. It is gloating over what it sees as the defeat of the U. S. and India as well. Pakistan needs to remember that Afghanistan is only a skirmish. The real fight with Pakistan will be on the global stage.
U all people are not supporting to kisan. 
Only 4% of Indian Farmers get MSP (and assured government procurement). Other 96% don't get it. That's why UP & Bihar farmers do labour in Punjab and Haryana. Now Modi government wants the farmers of Punjab and Haryana also to become migrant workers.
MODI SHOULD WAKEUP AND TAKE STRICT ACTION. WHY PUBLIC AND MEDIA ALSO SLEEPING ON THIS ISSUE
8. All want farm reforms. Punjab and Haryana farmers unions want to repeal
"Indian Government can't do anything, farmers themselves have chosen to remain poor!"

"If the farmers themselves do not want any policies then why is the nemestic government so eager to issue those?? Please stay strong farmer brothers, we all will support you no matter how long it takes to get justice."
"The same symbol is in Sahib Harmandir Sahib and the rest of the Gurudwaras to whom the vigilants of every religion-Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Jaini-bow down.

"These laws will make us slaves of ambani adani and new laws modi is making to make monopoly in businesses. Read farm law, read new working employment u will understand everything."
We support farmer.....
"Wondering how Mainstream media would cover this tonight? After all, they were hailing Modi for these ""Historic"" Laws "
I can understand when they say son of a farmer as am one !
Farmers are also citizens of India. The govt. should have to understand the reason of protest and people who eat today should thank a farmer. Violence is not a way to solve problem and farmers well know it. But indian govt. is not ready to confess its mistake.
"We r with farmers, love from hyderabad"
You are wrong. In Punjab in the past BJP never contest more than 20-22 seats. Absurd statements by Mr Abhijit.  Never BJP ruled Punjab. Priority is China preparation for attack India after Olympics. 15-02-2022 until 30.04.2022 will be war period. We lost Mr Arun Jaitley who was diplomat in local Agenda - Mukth Congress at Punjab - That is correct statement By Mr Abhijit
"1) Contract farmers can make contracts with farmers without farmers having any legal protection to appeal. Farmers will have to abide by fine prints in legal contracts, which even educated people like us cant fight with big corporates."
In the European Union the EU govt has given subsidies of 54 billion dollars since 2006 to support its agriculture sector to help it sustain simply as it was not profitably viable in the large scale but its something without which no one can sustain.
"3. personal relationship with middlemen : so the poor farmers all over india should not be given an option to sell their crops to private companies directly, because middlemen of punjab can give personal loans to punjab farmers. and farmer all over india are dying due to their poverty. but there should be a protest to save a personal relationship between punjab farmers and middlemen.  "

"Dhruv bhai, I was watching you and other news and wanted to share my family's experience. So, my family grows spices, turmeric and coconut and only seasonally mangoes. Our family shifted from paddy almost seven to eight years ago. Block development officer visit all farmers in the panchayat. He gives advice on which seeds to sow based on how much has been taken by other farmers as there may be a glut as everyone is growing same. But many of our neighbours do not listen to block development officers. We become dependent on MSP in case of paddy wheat some pulses etc."
I m feeling proud that i m the daughter of farmer  congrats to all the farmers ..
"When they were brutally killing that guy, suddenly the camera shifted, these fake farmers need to be taught a lesson"
BJP can only be defeated when Rahul Gandhi resign from Congress top post.    
Really impressed by the resolve of Sikhs and farmers.... salute to them
Farmers to Police:Unoreverse Card
 God pardon me for voting BJP in previous elections on the promise of Badal Dal. 
Appreciation of modi ji governance in their style.
"Moral of the Story- EVMs can only bring you to form a government but they dont give you power over people unless the people really vote for you. As far as BJP is concerned, whenever Modi is gone BJP is finished and if the EVM truth comes out before that then then BJP will be banned and Modi is in Jail. RSS will have to form a new party. "
"These laws were enforced in Bihar in 2006 and the owner of 5 acres/2 hectares in Bihar (Indian province) come to Punjab and Haryana (Indian agrarian provinces) to work as a farm labor because the MSP is not given the state since the laws were enforced. Rupees 1,800 is the MSP for rice, which is given in Punjab and Haryana but the corporates give them a mere rupees 800 price because they are exploiting the laws."
These people are not farmer. Our farmer are working in field. This is politics.
Why this much long more than 1 years this farmers protest is running around Capital Delhi only by blocking the every human life earning in the surrounding area's

"The government made these rules to help  and support the rich traders and not the farmers. The problems that the farmers are facing wont be limited to the farmers alone, they will next show up in the general society as well. The current government has succeeded in placing the future of the next generation of children of this country into deep slavery by promoting endless privatization, transferring wealth to the riches, performing changes in rules that were protecting the democracy so far. "
 He is a traitor... Rakesh Tikait..now give solutions to farmers. Stop putting burden on tax payers shoulders. That is what Rakesh Tikait are doing. Dirty politics... Rakesh Tikait should be in jail
"2. Just becoz there is a personal relation between farmer and agent who helps them financially when situation demands, why they need to demand for repeal. This applicable only to Punjab and haryana. There are farmers in other parts of india"
It's a loss for poor farmers.
Good too good students support farmers protest.
Justice for farmers 
No farmers No food 
I didn't like SG version. U actually justifying entire episode by proving it's government mistake but actually entire incidence is not good for Indian farmers and for us as a nation. Most of bold decisions are made with iron fist and eventually people fall in line.
Finally a relief for farmers
"Absolutely fantastic, Explained in a simple and lucid manner. Clearly shows vested interests are opposing the new farm bills. I hope good sense prevails."
People are with the farmers of the country. God keep farmers spirit high. JAI JAWAN JAI KISAN. JAI OUR ANN DATA

"Agriculture bill were cancelled just for the sake of elections, not to favour democratic attitude"
"Just to recollect, ter were farmers from south, not in this big number protested for months at delhi, jantar mantar..... naked protest, rat eating protest with no violence..... PM n govt did not have tym even to meet them... now its number game..... bigger d farmer number... protest is big n impacting d city......."
"I would have loved to find out how this impacts the other farmers - not just from the north indian states. For example, in my hometown, the farmers sell coconuts to the co-operative societies and they get paid around Rs.10 per coconut while it is sold for Rs.35 each here in the cities.The pricing is even worse for vegetables. All of this while they are plagued with issues like no labour, no water, floods. Obviously I can't rely on the regional media right now, because we are having our own drugs mafia episodes going around to cover up whatever it is that is happening here."
Jo Kiya wo kissano ke liye especially for small farmers ..
"Its in farmers hand how and where and when they want to see. Till they dont come into any agreement with the private organisation regarding their growing of vegetations. They can sell according to themselves if they are free from any binding. Its on farmers if they want to sell to any government bodies or anywhere in net. Farmers should decide completely in their moves. If according to the new bill they want to sell their product in any private organisations its on them. They can sell according to future rates or according to present rates thats should depend on them totally. Every profits gain should go to them. A government body should be formed which can look after the private mandis trade. There should be a government and 2 parties understanding where it should be memtioned about their future activities. The body should be given complete freedom to support and help the farmers and protect their gain or interests of anyway. It should be a clear transparency where state and central government should be earning by taxes and other means both in sarkari mandis or private. So government have to come into 2 job, thats providing safety and security and protection of farmers interests of anytype plus 2ndly to gain taxes in the mandis. It requires few clarification and changes in the law and the farmers can improve their vegetation and produce more keeping workers and labourers under them."

For farmers their produce is the only source they can survive. .and the farmers should be left alone to do their work. .Why does the GOVT succumbing to the BIG PVT PLAYERS TO TRESPASS and create problems for farmers? The govt can make provisions against for big farmers exploiting small farmers. But bringing outside GIANT players will eat up both small and big farmers MORE SO because the Govt and Govt bodies will DANCE TO THE TUNES of the GIANT PVT PLAYERS. & the farmer community will disappear or stop existing.

"I wonder if the farmers have considered making a national union so they can all agree on minimum prices that theyll sell to markets, its possible that companies could try and buy crops from other countries but I reckon theyd eventually cave due to transportation costs"

We want coverage of farmer's protest
"Indian has deployed 1 million Army in Kashmir to stop the voice of innocent Kasmiri people, now what will they do with their own Farmer protesters who raise their voice against  hinduta Govt who are involved in descrimination of minorities"
The farmers agitation is only troubling  poor public and Govt appears to be least bothered. 
Rakesh tikait...you are gradually earning my respect!
"I am here to let the viewers know that in Rajya Sabha a voice vote was conducted to pass the bill even after a roaring demand for individual voting. Nor was the bill passed to Standing Committee. i mean WHAT THE ACTUAL FCUK. Would you like to comment on this, Mr. Gupta?"
Farmer's Friends Tractors  March. Thumbs-up   
"People are saying ""abhiman tut gaya, ghamand tut gaya"" . But it is the poor farmers who lost today."
"Even if these laws were brought with intention to improve farming sector, the manner in which it was passed in the parliament n the timing raised doubts. Now the government needs to build trust with the farmers n hopefully bring about some reforms in the near future."
It's not Farmer's protest It's protest for every nt so rich Indian citizens for there future.
"Communists wanted to develop Afghanistan from a stone age country into a modern one, the afghan people said no and with the help of the USA they defeated the afghan socialists and soviets, the afghan people then choose the taliban who allowed terrorists to use their country as a base to attack the USA, the USA invaded and tried to develop afghanistan from a stone age country into a modern one, the afghan people supported the taliban and even gave US weapons to the taliban, which caused the US to gtfo asap, the Chinese communists then become friends with the taliban and now want to develop Afghanistan from a stone age country into a modern one, i wish the red fools the best of luck"
I support the Farmers.
Grain in Punjab Haryana MSP RS 1950 why its Rs 950 in Madhya 
- Cases against Farmers and activists should be withdrawn.
"Ma'am ,  2015 Niti Aayog data shows that 81 percent farmers know about MSP . So, why only 6 percent of them are using it. Please give some insights."
Modi should resign for not repealing the 3 black laws in time. What a shameful coincidence or is it Political Engineering as the Black Laws are repealed as the Sikhs celebrate the birth of Guru Nanak Devji the founder of Sikhism. Sweet Venom.
Just support farmers 
"Modi ji I'm feeling so sad, low and defeated (reg. farm laws repeal), though I know you're the most intelligent, most selfless, nationalistic and most experienced leader in the world..."
Tight slap on godi media thanks bro 
add msp as a law in bill. where is swami nathan report? where is 15 lakh. where is farmer double income. 7 saal main double nahi half ho gai hai. jimidhar kisaan finished almost in your Govt.
Support the farmers
"Well , What About the Economy Crash in Lockdown and petrol hikes. Stop playing the word game. Manipulation is at whole another level.  Don't play the tax card. We are already paying it in the form of our fuel. If you talking about minority , yes one minority is only being affected and targeted . So , Choose your words wisely and talk about the lost farmers the "" local of delhi """
Godi media is not welcome there..
The only tv channel NDTV help and support farmers and even farmer respect them 
Farmer politics....Congress support to farmer back for politics
Guptaji this session is a very cryptic view of the situation and BJP and it seems they have failed..but if you do not like them Farm laws is the wrong vehicle ..by praising the laws and at the same instant not supporting the govt in power one achieves nothing..if the implementation fails in the larger India..you are bang on!...Punjab and Haryana can wait for 18 months..not the rest of India!
Congress will be no more in India
what is the demand of Farmers ? why government can't agree ?
"He is saying ""Punjab ke badde kissan the"",  Most of these farmers owns less 5 acres of land."
"Unfortunately, the media did not pursue champions of the laws from within the silent majority and give them airtime in equal measure. Mobilization of stake holders (in this case farmers) in cities & towns across India, albeit on weekends, would have forced Protesters & Politicians opposed to these laws to ratchet down their rhetoric and forced the media to present a counter narrative."
"Punjab was divided in 47 with the majority hived off to PAK. Then in 66, we had the created of Haryana/Himachal. "
As well as farmers right
"Vallabhbhai went to Bardoli for the help of the farmers, one protesting lady called him Sardar"
2. farmers don't have negotiating power: farmers can force the governemnt of india to repeal the act which is for their own benefit. but the same farmer unions don't have negotiating power with private companies. 
3 . Modi is saying it's going to be 1 nation 1 market. It already 1 market we can sell our crops anywhere in india legally before this. 
so the conclusion of your report is mandi owners are in loss not farmers
The people of Afghanistan will never accept being ruled by this terrorist group.  In time everyone will see how determined the Afghan people are. Taliban will be sorry.
Literally abi tk ki worst ruling government h BJP.
I greatly respect farmer's but people faced behind mask who came to destroy peaceful protest must be arrested. Shame on them who want to bring India down.#eternalfarmers
"The laws weren't benefiting anyone for they weren't in force. BJP was being unable to make inroads into the protests which had turned a Sihk vs BJP protests, Punjab and the Sikh community was getting alienated day by day, there was no assurance if the laws would be ever in force. All in all, the entire situation was breeding only negatives for IND and there was absolutely no positives. Add to that, all organisations and individuals who were in support of the laws, they had passed the entire buck to the GOI, and GOI was visibly struggling under it's load."
"Late. Lal Bahadur Shastri and Late. Chaudhary Charan Singh .... Both former Prime Minister tried well to make reforms and benefits for Farmers... But Sadly the regime was 4 years ,  6 months respectively"

Stand with Farmers .
If union government can not take agricultural reforms....then why Agriculture is in Concurrent list....plz transfer Agricultural into state list....let state manage there farmers according to there need
"You should discuss, is farmer producing what is required in the country? If you produce more than required, price is going to be lower. Currently we are producing Wheat, Rice, Vegetables more than Dal, Fruits, Dry fruits etc. We need to reduce the former and increase the later."
BJP mistook farmers as Shaheen Bagh! 
Shame on you NDTV.. instead of saying BJP MP you have written it as Ex-congress MP
Thanks or convincing speech on the farmers bill
"Much needed but way delayed judgement by SC. In democracy you have right to protest but you can't block public places indefinitely. Many common people, business related transport even movement of ambulance is became tough. India loss billions per year for road and rail blocks. These people must talk with govt to resolve the issue. But it seems like some people don't want to end this agitation for their personal and political interest. Only some people don't represent farmers of the whole country. New farm law is for all farmers country wide and we must not underestimate silent majority."
He is Indian farmer. Keep it up
"Farmers won't drive dangerously  in danger ,there are people exploiting farmers"
"The best part of this interview is that farmers have proclaimed pm modi as the champion  of lies, another great achievement of modi."
This is blackmailing from farmers
"Yesterday was true diwali for Liberadu, Tukkade, congress, Muslim gang."
"If center government would have taken the laws back this would not have happened first of all.Secondly,this was done to malign the protest and put a black mark on the whole struggle the farmers are doing.The culprits should be arrested immediately."
Farmers are our life line. They should be protected.
"Indian don't have required numbers of Fighter Jets And Helicopters, But we gift others. Everytime in Indian development and Scientific progress there is a huge advertising by our media and vote bank. We do little but speaks more.

"In Bengal bjp conducting rally, there they don't have covid, covid is only for protestors"
"If you ask anyone who supports this protest then they'll say the new laws will create an existential crisis for the poorest of the poor farmers. But when you point out that these ""protesters"" can be seen driving a freakin G-wagon, then they'll say: So you believe farmers cannot be rich?"
"I feel ashamed that people in order to support a party defend the brutal killing of farmers...Today,a video has surfaced where it can be clearly seen that the TWO cars were too fast and farmers had no time to react..They r depressed and now if this happen then riots will take place out of anger.."
NOW farmers should not cry about middle men exploiting them because they themself stopped reforms

"Personally, I was happy about this new farm law because this motivated a new generation of young farmers who have new farming Idea's and can sell either to the government or to the big corporate buyers and make money free of tax...All dreams are shattered..."
"Farmers ensured country doesn't die of hunger..nehi toh jis rate se keemat bar rhi hai cizo ka Maggie v 80rs hota,tea v 50rs hota"
Bad news for small farmers
Kudos to the Modi Government for these fundamental reforms. All praise to our Prime Minister and his team for having the will to change the parasitic status quo in the Farm Sector.
"If corporates starts stocking up, the essential commodities will be costly even for the common man. The farmers are not just fighting their own fight but that also of a common man. We stand by farmers and want to congratulate modi for uniting us."
BJP: PM Modi doing everything with his might to stop the farmers from entering Delhi. Government digging the roads to stop farmer protests.' Irony..
Not a Farmers movement at all.
Farmers aage bado ham tumhare sath h 
I have a doubt. In this video you have mentioned that the APMC doesnt buy at MSP but in the video of farm bills you have mentioned how APMCs are used by big farmers to sell at MSP?? How?
He never spoke during farmer protest and today he is speaking. Dal mein kuch kala hai
Now Box understand  and says they are rich farmers not the poor one's.
"Look at this man, he is really good actor of India from gujrat, that's why people of india gave him pm position, but the Oscar   awards always goes to other countries actors. I'm so much affended by this yar..., This Oscar awards showing so much partiality towords indian actors,  Look at our honourable prime minister's Narendra Modi ji, he is such an good natural actor."
"debate, discussion sounds good for the farmers indeed should have happened ideally..but history tells us ..that it will not take the good anywhere.. even what is good for the farmers.. atleast not with this opposition."
Sorry but this time I am against the farmers 
Arrogant guy is silenced by the organized farmers. Hail Farmers
We support farmers. But not Voilence. But still full support to brothers. Im from Haryana. We were there. Not in chaos. In peaceful rally.
Now I  am loosing hope any hope in modi he is incompetent for hindutava
"Contact farming exist and it is not viable for a farmer to fight legally, hence are exploited. "
"This has led to many farmers to grow only rice and wheat in rotation as only thede two crops give a guranteed income. And THAT had led to severe drop in the nurtrient content of the soil and underground water table, especially as rice is a water intensive crop. Many environmentalist belive that this farming practice is leading to desertification of Punjab, including S.S. Johl who is an agricultural econimist. "
you obviously arent punjabi and have been watching too many bollywood movies and dont know ground reality.I can see there are lot of Modi Bhakats here. Only suggestion I have for them
And why would any farmer stay antil their need in their farms? Why will they remain wasting their time in protests during their Sowing and Harvesting season. No farmers who would actually be suffering would wait for so long for any purpose during their Sowing and Harvesting season. Starting from 9th August and continued for 7 months and 2 days. Can any farmer stay for so long. No they can't. Then who are these? They are the fake farmers or Not an Indian. Because no Indian would create Chaos on the Republic Day of his/her country India!
Govt should decide MSP on their own and make law that not mandi nor open market can buy below this.if they will then it wouldn't beneficial for farmers.
MrModi exactly knows why he withdrew the farm laws 
Powerful farmers
#SupremeCourtStand4Farmers
To Interfering indian govt and  farmers
You don't know Modi ji now in coming days such will be circumstances that farmer will come to Modi ji and ask for form bill 
Very nicely explained Mr Manish Kumar thanks. I did not know anything about farm farming n farmers but now i got an idea why farmer community is suffering so much on the other hand we depend on them but they are unhappy with poverty n no means of surviving. They must b helped in all possible ways even if it comes to reducing pay of politicians.
This is too much harrassment of farmers
Why aren't any protests around the whole country? Especially in the other agricultural states? Why only Punjab and Haryana?
In short these 3 bills are only good on papers.. But practically they will exploide farmers very badly.. And this only farmers can get.. I am standing strong with farmers.. 
So in conclusion this protest had nothing to do with farm bills but something that Punjab wants for past several years and that is their own rules and own country? Punjab either needs to learn to reform or India needs to find other channels. Govt should not be forced to pay for poor quality product just because of set minimum. If companies ran the show they wouldve had to do things correctly and thats what these farmers all fear (inability to cut corners).
"22:00 lets assume 10 years down the line, everything turns out as planned, corporates enter the agricultural market, farmers are getting higher prices, there are private mandis all over the country. How will the Indian govt honour its commitment to NFSA. Will it be buying from the corporates. I am sure they will sells the grains to Indian govt at subsidised rates just because those grains are to be distributed among poor"
"     The fear of these farmers may be real, but not substantiated by anything but speculation, despite reconfirmation that minimum price will be maintained.  In this battle the spirit of democracy need to win, which is not what most people think, it is the the freedom of choice of every one that needs to prevail, and not that of the mob(Wrong word to describe these peaceful worried farmers.. but to drive home a point). "
Feeling soo sad for these poor and innocent farmers
"Oh you must be happy , that what you guys called for and wanted . Shame on the people who were supporting these terrorists . Police must open fire on them and al terrorist symphatisors should be behind bars forever ."
Real question is all those in media who rallied behind Modiji will apologize as well or they'll simply shamelessly switch sides like they've always done? It is this godi media who has painted Modiji as invincible even though every few months China slices away a part of Arunachal. Unfortunately this PM attacks the weaker sections of the society but lacks a spine when it comes to China.
3. Why having APMC since 1965 still ensures only 6% of farmers are getting MSP??
Finally farmers proved who this country belongs to. Kisan EKta zindabad

"Tikat is a congress agent.  His task now is to defame every person who speaks against RAGA,  as Mr. Owaisi exposed impotency of rahul gandhi on several occasions, tikat calls mr. Owaisi as bjp agent.  Perhaps he himself is a congRSS pittu.  His barking won't impact the popularly of Mr. Owaisi."
"India needs Good Leaders, same goes for delhi police. Jab tum farmers ko nhi smja pa rhe to China to dur ki baat h. Really weak leadership on display yr, its been more than 6 months now. Embarrassing for the reputation."

"Existing system of procurement was used for 70 years, did it made the farmers rich?"
Congratulations to all brave farmers and brave news laundry team
Haryana farmers must protest against this Modi Government.. TAMILNADU will always support honest Haryana farmers to uphold truth and justice. At the same time Haryana farmers must take care of themselves against covid pandemic.
"In the age of AI & automation, blockchain & e-commerce, 5G & neuralink etc etc , our farmers are being held hostage by selfish few with vested interests. "
"4)The bills ensure that the farmer can enter into contract with a party and will gets  agreed price for his crops, so that farmers could survive beyond govt support by farming  commercially lucrative crops."
Farmers were right
My full support to farmer for there legal rights
Waiting for tippini after repeal of farm laws news.
"But I support whatever farmers want ,I don't understand laws so don't know who is right or who is wrong here."
For a long time I am a supporter of farmer but this is not accepted nobody is above the Tiranga.
Ravish Kumar the real reporter of india
Like the dispute between farmers and corporates will not go to court but will be settled by an Administrative officer. This can lead to favoured judgment as the law will not take ita due course
Everyone is like they are khalistani......do ya even know the history of Sikhs????n dont fuckin say that they want to divide India coz that's what RSS want.....n if uh can stop then do it...otherwise dont say that they did this or that
Jay Farmers.....!!!
"These were seperatists the clip if nishad.. there is exclusively mention of ""sikhon ko maarne k liye"" not ""farmers"".. "
The threat of farmers are true.
"Maine government, opposition, farmers union and media (BHAAND) sbse farm bill ke baare me  suna but hr trf propeganda, prejudice, misinformation hi sunne ko mila pr yaha pr factual information hindi me mili hai .. itni aasan bhasha me smjhane k liye aapka bahut bahut aabhar "
"Shame on Zee TV. Few days back, you were showing that the broders are empty now. To defame the leaders, you are showing now that farmers are on roads in rains etc. Where were you earlier?"
These opportunities for ambanis & adanis not for farmers because we know about our pm's promises
"This same thing happened when  the privatization of electricity in 2002 takes place but we almost increased our capacity to produced electricity 4 times after privatization of this sector. The  protest also happened when the liberalization of indian economy takes place, but we know how it helps to uplift India economy ,now it time to liberalize farming sector whether people like it or not. But those who know little bit about economy knows that these law definitely improve the condition of farmers especially  the farmers of Bihar, UP, Bengal who have most fartile land but due to the government policy's they are poor. Punjab just afraid of not getting cheap labour from these states because after this law the farmers of these state become more phosphorus."
This is a very peaceful protest. We support the indian farmers.
Election is not the main reason jo vote bjp ko dene wale hai wo dene hi wale hai vice versa
"Can someone explain if as he said, 94% farmers are not using APMC to sell their produce so I believe they're still being exploited regarding pricing as they do not get MSP. So why are farmers protesting if most of them don't use the present services? It seems that he didn't cover the entire situation and there is much more to it that what he's describing here."
Zee media shame on you kitne talve chatoge
The andh bakths will justify this while eating the food that farmers were bleeding to make...

"Anyone if don't know, farmers won!"
"People talk about kumbh , rallies , but not this corona  obviously support farmers"
Great punjabi and farmer bhai
-> fear of losing farmers support
These 3 laws are for betterment of farmers & some political parties and groups taking advantage of this protest.

Farmers stand your ground . Do not allow the corporations to take over.
"Is liye BJP hatao desh bachao  ,,Dil se Congress "

India must establish good relation with Taliban using their diplomatic skill to protect the Indian interest in and around Afghanistan.
Very Happy n bigest salute to Unity of Farmers. U all are saviour of democracy n guide to whole nation.
"We support Modiji, we support BJP only who can take India to a new HORIZON"
"Sir 700 people died, his party netas call farmers as terrorists and jihadists. Modi didnt even give a single speech sadly stating it. Like amarawathi farmers, farmers all over should start a walk to each and every state and publish about rest of laws, loss caused to farmers by it and fight till each and every farm bill is repealed. Farmers should be supported by each and every state government and help them acehive it."
4. Why can't we promote better FPO/FPC to empower farmer to make better deals rather than always saying that a farmer can't negotiate ???
"Lol I saw police throwing stones and fighting , farmers look better."
Godi media will never show this
Nothing wrong in asking for a discussion. Why are the laws being repealed ?  what happened?  Is it because the government could not bear to see more farmers dying at the morcha ? or some other reason like the upcoming elections in some states ? It is a democracy.
"I am not getting why some ppl still defending the protesters. Instead defending, they should take over those violent ppl to police as soon as possible. It will help in investigation and the soft feelings for protesters(actual farmers only) will be alive. Jai Hind."
It was happened with farmer is very crucial way now in india it is seen like that humanity isn't present here 
By heart I am thankful to lallontop channel to standing for farmers  (truth).
@Dhruv Rathee.. i think you should post a video on current situation after government consideration and meetings with Farmers.
"Shekhar ji your analysis made so much sense but when I reflected on it, it struck me that only farmers of Punjab haryana and Jat farmers of western UP protested."
Now each farmer (protesters) will become billionaire 
"He tested the water's, did everything to hurt the farmers and the citizens who came to show solidarity with them were not spared"
Well done Modi. Punjab is sure shot to come in BJPs ambit with Captain Amarinder.
India is way behind in information warfare....we are loosing information warfare against china and pakistan externally and internally too...we are not able to pass the massage to general public.
support the farmers
"Secondly, there is no tax on farmer, rather buyers pay the tax"
"Interesting days, looks like BJP wants to secure UP and help Capt gain Punjab."
This incident surely changed our perception of farmers as helpless and ignorant lot.
They are not farmers....... opposition parties
India's agriculture development is not even in dreams. Good luck Indian farmers. Slow claps for you guys 
"While the anslysis is loaded with the SG's prejudice against BJP, but Modi Govt is not the one to shy away from a challenge... This may well be a tactical retreat, time will tell ofcourse..."
BJP goons has  cross the limit. Please everyone who loves their Dharti Mata stand against the corrupts leaders and make India beautiful.
I can guarantee one thing ..no one of them  can tell all 3 bills that is proposed by the modi govt.
"Shame on Indian  Media, Shame on Central Govt."
"I do think the govt should look at the loop holes,the legal framework would end up favouring the corporates.the farmer cannot go to court for years"
"In short, if mandi gives a better price, then farmer will sell in APMC and it will not collapse. But if private player offers better price, then why farmer will go to  APMC? it is useless."
"Abhijit Iyer Mitra was quite on the mark to point at an ignored area I.e. the underlying reality that today Punjab is heavily controlled by Khalistanis in Canada and UK, a threat the Indian Governments, both UPA and NDA underestimated, and that, it is the Khalistanis that fund the ISI and not the other way round. "
You missed out the most important fact... Farmers are not actually against bills.... They are saying just assure us MSP in writing in bill....on which govt is giving verbal assurances which is not acceptable to them....farmers are more intelligent than all economists put together...
This was a super attempt to demistify the complex fam bills and it's impact both on us as well as the farmers. Very well done.
This a really a backward move. Simply political move. I did not expect this from Modiji & BJP. 
Isn't  Muslim a farmer ?
3 Laws should be improved instead of repeal. punjab aur UP ke addtiyon ko andolan ki jeet mubark ho.Tiket & Yudhvir gang misguided the innocent farmers who neber red 3 laws even...
And no government has. Even able to significantly create jobs where the farming community can be weaned out of farming which is becoming more & more poorer as 86.5% of the farmers have less than 1.5 acre of land and this holding is continuously reducing. You can see the exodus of farmers abroad from Punjab where this is a major reason although some bigger farmers also emigrate due to the quality of life abroad. However majority emigrate as farming is not viable and there are no suitable white collar jobs available elsewhere.
If Modi n Shah think they can use this violence as an excuse to crush the farmers protests by using their old tactics then they again will be doing a grave mistake. They should give what farmers have been requesting.
I really really enjoy following your analysis. Currently one my favourite resources. Can you please explain/link farmer suicides to your analysis and history of agri reforms in India?
Kisan andolan is a sponsered by Congress and other parties. 
They are Tractor-Terrorists
I am Indian from West UP and there is injustice being done to the farmers which is wrong. I strongly condemn this and the government should change it and accept the farmers' words.  Modi government is doing good for big businessmen but by implementing this law they will cut off the stomach of poor farmers and laborers.
Only 5-6% farmer sell grains at MSP price.
Finally India today trying to shed godi media tag
Now it is opportunity for youth to start companies for cold storage and packaged food like milk which will benefit farmer also and will increase exports
Fun fact: Opposition protested these farm laws but this govt passed the law unlawfully. Farmers protested for almost whole the year but PM never spoke to them personally. 
"""NOBODY IN THIS WORLD IS MORE PATIENT THAN A FARMER"""
Glad u were not biased on your take.. we just need unbiased news in these times. If there is proper regulation of this with farmers not being taken advantage of then I tnk the farmers will be hugely benefitted by this bill.
"SHAMELESS congressmen, congresswomen, congressees, etc....... I *VOW, SWEAR, take OATH to NEVER EVER* vote to congressmen, congresswomen, congressees, their direct and/or indirect associates and/or allies and/or supporters, etc........ whatsoever"
BJP didnt wanted to repeat the West Bengal performance in UP so better he took this decision immediately to atleast give a fight in UP election.
Mr ravish saying there is no loud speaker on TRACTOR  NO protest will go on peacefully manner doesn't look whatever they said
Sir aap bengal chale gaye the election ke time ek bar Ghazipur border pe bhi aa jate to shayd farmers protest khatm kr dete...
Compared with other Products So they decided to fix that Product every Farmer try to Seedling that Product-A
"In my view there should be a law on msp, To give  some protection to farmers also."
Okay.. you didnt talked about the tool kit from greta.. and how rihana was paid.. the khalistan protest and khalistani terreroists.. and you didnt even mention the benefits of the law.. as how this will increase their standard of living.. the PM of INDIA has already said that.. the farmers who want these laws to be followed can follow them and those who dont want they can not.. its not forcing all the farmers to follow it .. its compulsory ...
Opposition parties some of them who exploited India in name of development are now agitating the innocent farmers to become violent . Shame on those people . Please get a life or leave politics forever . Shameless opposition. Won't do anything won't let other develop .
 Instead of subsidies it's better to give good price for farm products.
"Official slogan of indian farmers ""Jo bole so nihal"""
"farmers should consider amendments .... passing new farm laws will be a hectic process , re appealing  of laws will harm govt image ... surely agriculture sector need reforms let it start this way . Any problem in future will sharply affect the govt chances to win ...."
10 lakh people participate this protest ..bt national media not cover it properly...shame on indian national media..they cover only negativity..... good lalantop
Stop the Farm bills immediatly with out discussions
It is the failure of the government - who made our farmers sit in the outskirts of Delhi in the freezing cold for two months-  making 3 bills to capture farmer's lands - is it not too much dictatorship on these annadadads ????
Which also proves that the farm law is good and -ley impacting the brokers. One more the farmers are rich ( or being funded)  and have the resources to go on protest.
"I think these laws are very important for the country.  Middlemen must go. They are reaping the benefits of MSP, not the smal  and marginal farmers."
This video needs to be republished in all regional languages and shown on Doordarshan so farmers can actually understand what's the deal.
I support farmers 
Farmers will win. There is no other way.
I support the farmers
Is it not allowed for a farmer to progress in his life with his hard work? Even after progressing in his life if he/she remains in the farming sector he/she is a real hero....
"If the all Farmers should sell their products to Private corporaters... They are completely collapsed PDS.. then there is no mean of Rashan Cards,Antodaya Ann Yojana, BPL cards."
Congratulations to the farmers. Blessed is the Nation of India. Leadership is about understanding and flexibility. Congratulations to Prime Minister Modi.
Whats wrong with Indian media
Indian  farmers ? ?.............No no no no never. they are not Indian  farmers.
Sachi baat  ....if any party exist in India to demolish it's property then I think that party is CONGRESS  ....
"May be you want welfare of India but you can't ignore Indian citizens...We are still striving for food and job .,kindly provide these.. we are not in Wonderland that your animated jumlas will help us..we are in India and we still striving for survival..Msg to BJP"
"I am a law student , My father is a Farmer. Thanks for rising your voice, disscuss about the real facts of farmer. Love from Assam."
In our telangana state govt directly purchase from farmers 90% of state crops on MSP also gives free insurance of rs 5 lakh free electricity rs 1000 per acre investment
Now its the time to take U Turn by an Indian Govt to support Taliban instead of Afghan Govt.....
"Modi ka jumla, just like 15-15 Lakh , Amit shah will announce later that it was an election jumla"
"For those who distribute ""Gyan"" on Kisaani and all.. I am not just come from farmer family, I do help in family farming as well."
Bjp party ab tera kya hoga. bjp party not support Indian
We support farmers 
Sir i can believe that kisaan from Punjab are influenced by foreign entities but is it possible for alll farmers from our motherland india and u know very well conditions of farmers in our motherland republic of india
"By the way, Some of the farmers for some money from various political parties have taken the gold away from many farmers of India. Sad to see"
No it will hit farmer leaders and congress and also who funded this protest..
"Ans: killing farmers who are protesting, declaring them anti-nationals , treating the farmers even worse than terrorists. "
It's  a true reality. We are not only loosing the farmers but also the youths who  are supporter of BJP. I just remember the line by Dr Rahat Indori who said
Whose incompetence is the inability to solve the problem of the farmers
Really great Job Rakesh ji.. God Bless you all Farmer's
"Clearly presented arguments from both sides. However, the last point that our government can (in fact regularly does) limit free market operations in agriculture by banning imports and exports at the expense of Indian farmers should not be held against this particular bill. The fact exists independent of this bill. We can only hope that the tendency will reduce gradually as it only hurts our agriculture industry."
I salute to brave heart farmers to stand against such dictator government. Very very egoistic Prime Minister india have right now. I hope people will understand and bring back the democracy
"I am from Pakistan and i think these new laws will not effect farmers, but if the intentions of the government was to make this just for the sake of rich corporates, then these corporates will definitely squeeze farmers and their familly."
"I don't think it's anything related to Punjab election. BJP stakes are negligible and someone like Modi having all experience that one can't win election like this, starting just 6 Month before."
The government approved for unlimited storage for some food items if this happens then the supply will fall and demand will rise and with the demand the price of these commodities will also rise
"I am sure none of the farmers except a few know as to why they are agitating, APMC s are controlled by politicians, this is the reason why Punjab government is supporting the agitation. And gullible farmers are being manipulated by politicians who are blackmailing the central government. How sad."
I won't argue any further. Will just say only one thing. For once lets accept that these laws aren't friendly for the people of Punjab. Farmers there just don't want private players to enter in Punjab. Then there IS AN EASIER WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS.
#Supports farmers protect
All students in our country should support to our farmers. Our students only having power to change any one. All advocates also should join with our farmers. This is my humble request for every Indian citizens
Support for farmers from Kashmir ....
Aisa to supreme court was stayed these Farmer rules...ye kya hai jo Pm announce new thing...after 700+ death of farmer...insensitive Pm
"This Rajesh tikait is not a farmer, it is a madman"

Making the farmer suffered is like torturing your own stomach .
"What a reporting, man! Salute to these farmers, their spirit and courage."
"He ruined the lives of youth  ,farmers and poor Indians."
We support BJP..
"It is not the victory of farmers , but the defeat of non farmers . Now non farmers will face the consequences ."
Read a newspaper . You'll actually know more than what Indian or foreign media will tell you.
It is anti BJP andolan. Majority of the farmers are not with this Tikait drama. 
Hlw Abhi $ Niyu . I Love Your Videos So Much . Can You Please Make A Video On #Hindu Code Bill # Please 
We stand in side  of farmers
I'm on police side they are not farmers my uncle got to much injury they are not farmers they are terrisot 
"Government's response has been fervently against repealing the laws, same as the farmers refuse to buckle. So the government is also maintaining peaceful resilience. Politics aside, no one has been harmed."
Sir your role in this protest is unpredictable very highly respected personality on social media belive it or not your contribution in this victory is more than 70% I'm your regular follower a big fan of your Supperb Couverage TRILLIONS of Sallutes STAY SAFE THANKS GOD BLESSINGS
Farmers hai to hum hai
12)All transaction between farmers and consumers are must be in white. I really encourage to do digital transaction if possible.
Now people  who are agitating must stop them. Status quo will continue for farmers.
We shouldn't see only one aspect of any situation which our media/social media tells us.... Jai Jawaan Jai Kisaan
So excited when government are humiliated THX FARMER
"The farmers are so aware about their rights and the govt is calling them misguided. Even they speak English, better than Modi. Hatsoff to our farmers. "
"01:41   Modi is an elected representative . When he sees no farmers supporting the bills but sees farmers who oppose the bills, he has to do what an elected representative is supposed to."
Greatest living Punjabi/ Greatest living Indian is Manmohan Sir.
Fall of Berlin wall 1989 was my favourite historical revolution but now my Farmers make me proud
I feel very sorry today for our farmer brothers and sisters.
Farm bills are not at all good for farmers ! On such a platform you should have better knowledge
* there is a steady decline in agricultural production as depicted @3:45 during the times when the archaic farm bill existed
Most simplest and unbiased explanation about the farm bills.
You are a great enemy of the Indian farmers Mr tikait
7:18 That's true and thats the reason why farmers in bihar are in extremely poor condition.
This is the worlds largest democracy in action. No other country manages over 400 million farmers in a democratic process. Hopefully better outcomes evolve over time.
"It is a black spot in the history of India,  killing our own food feeders. Taking part  in the issues people are facing is certainly great.   If people want to feel faith in Congress Party it should be democratic first  and then people should have a feel that the Party belongs to people of India and not of some individuals and families."
The point is this is Punjab specific issue. Centre govt should allow states to decided whether they want to implement these laws or not.
Finally our Legend Farmers Won 
"Yaswant Sinha said: The Prime Minister has stuck to his reputation of springing surprises. The announcement of the decision to repeal the three farm laws came as a huge surprise last morning, which, apart from being the pious day of Guru Parab, was also the birthday of Indira Gandhi. The comparison with Indira Gandhi is apt because she also withdrew the Emergency when she realised it had become untenable. Despite all his bravado, the Prime Minister came to the same conclusion, and because he is an 'election-jivi', and elections to five states including the all-important state of UP, are around the corner, and because defeat was staring him in the face, he was left with no option but to withdraw these black laws. In my tweet after the announcement I said, ""While I congratulate the Kisans on their victory over the government for the repeal of the farm laws, I attach no noble sentiment to the government for this move. It is a calculated step for the UP elections. For this government, democracy begins and ends with elections."" So this is it: nothing more than an election gimmick."
Farmers want under middle man control 
"11:00 with all due respect Shekhar, if Modi govt would have announced a law that would make them more strong in congressi voter base, congress being the china friendly anti nationals that they are , wouldnt even let the discussions begin."
"3. INDUSTRIALIZATION: it may not be agriculture itself but can surely improve the life of a lot of people who were in farming previously as it will create job opportunities for millions to come out of agriculture and shift into comparatively higher value manufacturing as service sector is legendary bad at providing enough job opportunities especially to a population as large as ours (I hope you can relate it to india) and agriculture though extremely important for ""LIFE"" is very bad as a source of ""LIVELIHOOD"" so we should focus at trying to improve productivity of a farmer so that less and less farmers can also feed the nation and shift the rest into comparatively higher value manufacturing industry."
None of these politicians are for the nation or farmers... all of them are well aware of it but......
Begging in the streets of UP for Votes from farmers.
I love Godi media for their dedication for Government....WE SHOULD APPRECIATE THEIR swami bhakti....
Now AP&TG farmers will suffer because of Punjab. The decision must be given to states to repeal or continue farm laws.
This is the victory of our nation as a democracy. Kudos to everyone who supported this revolution both on ground and online.
"1. If procurement has to be tinkered with, there HAS to be an alternative for the farmer. You cannot leave ALL THE FARMERS of Pb & Hry out in the cold."
Congress for Farmers
Modi and other political parties are enjoying the parade when the farmers are suffering. If farmers are not happy why don't modi take back his bills which farmers are unhappy and being pushed to have them.
"Even if the flag wasn't ""replaced"", how come it's a religious flag? Not all farmers are sikh."
This is what happens when farmers of any country become angry
Other farmers must protest and demand these laws .
Yogi is better than Modi that I feel now.
Support the farmers 
"_Even after organiszing crowded mass political rallies he lost in Bengal elections, he don't want the same fate in coming Punjab & UP elections_"
The farmer agitation  was politically supported.
"Wow good batting by police helmet also nice BUT remember police we are n u alive bcoz of Farmer producing Food, vegetables. From 2day u don't buy any food only have salary."
BJP is doing better than Congress and India needs it!
Honest true so you deserve this respect but shame on Ajtak the Godi media
"This bill had many advantages to farmers.. with the direct intervention of private players will reduce the chance of wastage of crop grown... This will improve the technology investment in farming that reduces the burden for farming.. and many advantages.. India has a myth stating farmers are uneducated, innocent but in reality present generation is not like that. Instead of saying private players can loot farmers let us educate farmers"
"Correct your facts first, not 70% but 84.67% farmers of india are small scale farmers"
Open market sounds good.but it is not practical in nature as majority of farmers are small and marginal .
3 MSP ke sath sath MRP pe bhi agr sarkar decide kare according to production and storage etc charges consider karke to conusmers ko b faida rahega... middlemen ko hatane se zarur kisan and consumer dono ko faida hoga.. but MSP MRP fixed kare sarkar.man lijeye jo fasal 20 rs kilo khredi h woh 40 rs kilo se jada na bbech paye retailer.to black marketing and price hike apne aap control rahega

As Kisan working on advice of oposite party and  other party interesting fall of Modi anhow. Modi agreed Kisan proposal but opposite if permit to kisan they will drink water. Regards
Very pleasing speech by our Honourable PM Modiji... great personality... tried much efforts in the reforms of Farmers Law.... 5times budget increased...  welfare schemes provided to farmers.....made proposals from agriculture experts to balance the gap between the government and farmers.....but it's very sorry to say that our Honourable PM Modiji... So humbly he apologize for the farmers bill and wanna repeal it in the forthcoming winter session...... You are our great leader...
"Bro if you can answer, yeah media may be taking off topic route, but what about khalistan supporters, I mean there was literally a tractor with  ""khalistan zindabad"" slogan written.  Should you or should we just ignore it? Farmers may be not happy with the bew farmers bill but but should we ignore the evil, lurking in the shadows?"
This is Government Who did Announce  2015 At November 8   the same  super PM Modi telling media that devaluation of currency who suffered poor farmers  and people in villages so modi said give me ninty days  if  not I resign but till today his not slow  the currency problems  farmers bill pass with in twenty four hours  Announce  they has parliament. also opposition  did not listen to them because only thing they majority in parliament they did not want  know  anybody they  the KING
     All Indian farmers
Now GODI will say these Kisan are all Khalistani . This is what happens when people are angry with BJP and GODI media has no balls to question the government. Jai Hind.
This will only help big farmers. But loss for the small farmers. There are only handful of big farmers.
I wonder people say there was brotherhood between Hindu and Muslim .
Victory for the farmers.
I always support farmers 
I remain Abhijit s fan but I do think I will give Modi ji more credibility than he is giving for this decision. This is Air India moment for Abhijit 
"All this laws have been imposed for the future planning. Punjab is the border state in india, which has land access to countries like Pakistan, Arabs and Russia. In future there will be no petrol or diesel and will be replaced by electric transports. { Short cut routes will be essential for transport}. So Adani and Ambani wants to own Punjab to take over the trade in future. These laws are to finish the land owners in Punjab and when there is no landlords then adani and ambani can control the trade in future. Punjab is the pathway for agriculture business in future worth billions of DOLLARS. First weaken the farmers and then take over their land. Then adani and ambani owns Punjab. Punjab is being looted for more then 40 yrs now... Drugs have been deliberately and purposely supplied into Punjab to weaken their youth. Bollywood is given the main role into supplying the deadly  stimulant,  people nowadays have trust on bollywood gods. This fight should be for all Bhartis not only Farmers, because these suckers are coming up to steal everything from us. Some countries are looking forward for these change for their benefit. Don't you think you all should wake up now. How much poor you want to be ? These riches ones are not originally  Bhartis. They are the lineage of italian , Israels etc. Fight now or NEVER.  May God destroy the blood suckers. { This statement has been simplified for ease understanding for everyone.}  Please watch the ' I goat  Pet II ' video as well."
I am with farmers.
We r with the farmers.They r right.We welcome them to delhi.Govt should agree  to their demands.
"Shame on BJP. LONG LIVE THE FARMERS WHO FEED THE MILLIONS. 56"" chest and 3"" in the pants."
Please don't trust him as a farmer he deceive u as a politician..... Illogical views..
Thanks for telling truth. May god bless you. Love from punjab and haryana.
"This might go down in history as your Stalingrad mr modi. A bill for which you and your entire party were vigorously campaigning for past 1 year, u withdrew it and backstabbed all the people who believed in you. Kahan gayee apki 56 inch ki chhati? Aise desh nahin chalte, tikait jaise dakait ko national leader banane ke liye aapko bohot bohot badhai"
Always be together brothers  punjab and haryana you guys are real power if you are together
My opinion  is that we need to consolidate the national agenda. Enormously military capabilities are being developed by china. Even the Americans have been pushed to the 2nd position with respect to the quad defense capabilities. China is also the richest nation now. Punjab is too  precious to let farm laws divide it. Let us consolidate to face the Chinese might. Let us move forward.

"Development means more jobs, high salaries, low utility costs, low taxes, affordable health care, high quality education and large number of growth opportunities. Justice based governance means nobody can misuse power. Self-respect and inner strength means always standing with the right no matter who is against you. It doesn't matter you die rich or poor but make sure you die with self-respect. For that to happen ask government about development and knock it down if justice isn't served. Farmers are doing the right thing and Modi is one of the biggest scam."
"Hindu Rashtrawad, Sanatan Dharma , Khalistan and government support are things."
"I think we need to see from goverment perspective too, like why they are making this law which obviously spark the farmer protest"
Well if you under NCP govt or Sharad Pawar. All the middleman business or agriculture Mandi's are been headed by NCP Congress leaders and most of the money generated here were cash and were in small in amount like Rs. 10-80 which nobody bothers much but this small amount becomes a big fund raising when it gets in number multiplication. And secondly it's a daily essential food products which are daily consumed. So just understand the amount of black money this sector generates. Hence this is the main source of black money generated by the political parties mentioned.
"All farmers who are supporting this, and those who didn't support this,"
No farmer No food 
Taliban has also captured hero splendor plus..gifted by India..
You are a true example Indian Farmers. Not only did you achieve this for which I am so happy for you But you have shown the rest of the world things are not hopeless! You give me strength!
One farmer died just bcz of his own mistake im happy one filthy soul departed
"I have tears in my eyes, you go girl! #farmersprotest"
Finally after 1000s of farmers sacrificed their life to come to this day .

"Just because i hate bjpee doesn't mean i love Congress. I have never ever given a single vote to the Congress. In 2014 i voted for nota, in 2019 i voted for bjpee. In 2924 is we have the same candidate, i am closing for nota again."
These farm laws were not there for last 50 years but farmer suicides were there. There is no correlation between these two things. I dont know why people think that if these laws are taken back things will be better.
Why don't you bring Modi and yogi and amit shah criminal rss related  data then we can believe you. Jai Bheem. Sat shri Akaal ji.
There is some sort of politics going around in the leaders of SKM as well ... i am not saying all of them but some of them for sure. I. Have one question too? When people were marching to delhi from punjab and haryana barricades were broken and farmers were attacked and barricades have been broken in delhi on 26 .. so how come breaking barricades become such a huge issue when previously it was not. Clashes were there before too... Singhu border tikri border are not a home of farmers.
My father is a commision agent . We share a very lovingly bond with farmers. They use to greet him chacha me as a brother. We were known about these things from past 3 yrs. that govt. is going to take action against mandis. After your video we are fully sure that we are fully awared with the laws. In my opinion govt. Should take actions before speaking much. Sirf bol rhe hai ek aadha kisaan ki maang ko lekr law enact kr diya jaaye. 
"Addaaaniiii who was waiting to earn profits by these laws, waits to shoot these farmers, lead to their death, and thinks that he is the real farmer!! #nooffense"
Support the farmers!Farmers feed the world!
"Most of these protestors don't know the 3 farm laws. And most important these farmers are also citizens, they should do this protest peacefully. What they did in 26 Jan is a shameful act. If they are civilised then they should do the protest in a civilised manner. That's all"
Must Share Support Farmers ~
"Dictatorship shown by BJP ruled states, Digging well built Roads to setup barricades using stones, Dirt and vehicles, what a shameful act by Modi Govt."
"Just to correct you with the fact ,farmers doesn't pay the tax in APMC mandi ,its to be paid by the buyer  ."
"I think the few points what you have missed were already highlighted in comment section. The main fact I'd like to put forth is that, ""In any which way, Farmers and Middle class will see ups/downs. The only reason we are seeing chaos out there is b'coz it's creating an impact on many Mediator groups which connects us (may it be Dealers, Mandi owners or State Govt. itself)."
"honourable sir im mba student , during study i have to give presentation and i get topic farm bill so I watch this video and this video help me to clear my concepts thank you for makeing this type of videos and please do upload this regularly my goal is not ias but im curious abut this topics so please upload this regularly"
Phir se 12 Dec mega congress rally join us
As their is election in UP. Modi govn. don't want to take risk.
Acha hota UP and Punjab election pahle ho jaate . 
"In the name of kisan ,who are playing mischief?  Paid. agitators must get punished .Kisan are all over India but antinationals are few and doing mischief ! Great show.... great practice to make show!"
Modi being a farmerlike himself had forgotten the plight of farmers after occupying the highest office in the country. It's unfortunate.
They are the one who feed every mouth but this is the price paid by the Government of India. This is New India Of PM Modi
"There is lot of unemployment in Punjab and Haryana. That's why so many jobless people were available for protests. Ironically, cross-subsidy of farm electricity is driving away industries away from Punjab, causing unemployment."
3:15 - No-one should loose their rights - She nailed it... I support my lovely farmers.
Interesting thing is that most farmers unhappy with the laws are from Punjab and Haryana where the richest farmers of India live. Why isn't there any major protest in any other states???.
what a  liar!see his video on brut india...he supported the bill earlier..he is playing with people..
"Today I lost the inner Respect for all the Indian farmers . I WILL NEVER EVER Respect any farmer from now onwards till my last breath . Today farmers have hurt the pride of our and their own Nation too . India will never forget this unethical , brutal attack by farmers on their own Nation. If we have such farmers we don't need Pakistan and China to witness our down fall . And after today's incident I now think farmers deserve some hardships . Today they insulted our own Nation on international level "
Well done farmers . It takes a big person recognition his mistakes  well done Modi. Now bring the country together.
The real problem is there are to many farmers in india for it to be sustainable.  The average farmer in india works a insanely small amount of land to be cost efficient.
BJP ministers Car rally at roads will clear highway 
"Whoever questioned the farmers today in this PC on Teni resignation demand, hats off to him for possession of audacity to ask a question which can corner both SKM & government."
"Long live the revolution...well done Indian farmers, you pushed backed those fascists."
The Laws were meant to benefit the farmers by destroying the power of wholesale mafia. But the benefits have not been understood by the farmers.
Goverment decided that only low income farmer get benefit of MSP so poor farmer first get benefit of this.

"Indians remember one thing if farmer will collapse, whole civilization will collapse"
Overall this bill will benefit adani and ambani and farmers will left with nothing and we can say that this is another master stroke by our PM to help their corporate friends.
You could also have given an assumption as to why the govt. fails to acknowledge the demands of the farmers.
wow... i salute the courage of the farmers
All these years farmers in Maharashtra were doing suicide because of these farm laws. Now they will all live in luxury. Thanks to their support to Punjab farmers.
Farmer is lifeline of food industry
"By this draconian law , we lost life of 600 farmers....Modi is such a arrogant and sadist PM in Indias history"
Congratulations  Taliban wish you all the best we love you  Pakistan zindabad 
"Only modiji,Jay hind "
"It's really amazing, if 50000 Taliban can defeat US Europe India and their allies. It means in future Pakistan can hunt down India easily."
They hided  the farmers by saying agriculture is the backbone of Indiavery worst behaviour
17:05 he is only telling half side of the fact and misleading... Why don't check the income of US farmers it's relatively more than average Americans and most of the farmers are in excellent condition... Only 2.2million people are there in farming thier cause of failing are completely different from indian farming.. Reasons are also very different!! Wtf dont mislead people
"The demand Yadav is making is that penal provisions be included that, if anybody buys farm produce below MSP, he will be put to trial and punishment. In case it is done it is sure that the produces will rotten if there is oversupply in the market. Take the example of wheat. If oversupply is there for wheat (which can be easily produced), the excess produce will not be purchased by anybody due to fear of legal provisions. So the demand for penal provisions is utter foolishness. It will put especially small and medium farmers into more trouble."
Hope they reinstate the farm laws in a phase wise manner post state elections
We tax payers must protest giving all freebies to these unproductive farmers as it6wastage of our tax money
"Mr. Rathee , can you explain why those bills were not in favour of all the indian farmers not a particular segment of society.  Opposing a party is not bad but opposing the decision which could bring prosperity to farmers is irony."
"Farmers wins 4th time, 2 times under British rule"
Thanks for the support farmers
Same here in canada. I have strong emotional attaching to my beloved ancestor land India.  Seeing government doing this to farmers is really sad.
"Actually yesterday in Punjab, 131.14 lakh tonnes of wheat has been procured, which is an all-time record. I think your video doesn't cover the entire situation precisely. There have been multiple talks between the farmers and the government. The government is ready to make changes to the law. But the farmers are adamant that they will only accept abolishing of the laws. The entire situation is very complex and hard to understand! Also when you are reporting some numbers, you should take the covid situation as well into account!"
"I hope the  farm laws stand and don't fail.i wonder if the civil rights movement or even India's freedom had been fought when social media was around ,would we be living the same lives.We need to step up our game against information warfare"

Why Was & is Deep Sidhu's Farmer Union allowed to camp on police's side at singhu border?

"Pre-planned agitation, find the solution on coming discussion between farmers and GOI. Thanks."
Police's action against farmers make them more aggressive. So stay back. And it's a warning to the modi.
"That person killed to farmers , don't think any way to let him of farmers killer .  On the spot shoot them . We all indian peoples  stand with farmers . Farmers our lives without farmers we can't go any step . Without food we can't working for 1 hour . All should to respective them of farmers .  Farmers life is valuable than BJP antisocial Criminal ."
"Thank you for your video. Furthermore, these 3 Bills of Law will simply remove the 1 to 1 relationship farmers have with their buyers, create mass unemployment in already poor rural areas and furthermore leave the farmers to the mercy person to big corporations.  These new laws remove the courts, federal state and larger governments legal capacity to support farmers during contract disputes and moves this in to the hands of bureaucratic officers  so we should ask is corruption still an issue in India??? The current 'Mandi' and Arhtiyas system provides a number of other key services to farmers, they provide small low-rate loans, labour, network farmers together and provide assistance to farmers when they are struggling. It is also worth noting that farmers are small businesses and if you ask any business owner, cash flow is the heart of any successful business, as many unexpected costs can often arise. These laws will erode a current credit system and no private company will not replace this  and why should they? If farmers in one bad year; are at the mercy of corporations, have no access to credit and state intervention or legal recourse they will be forced to sell their land to respond to a short-term problem when they arise. Once they sell their land, they sell the only asset that they may own. In fact, in every western country it is well known a persons earnings only contribute to 25% of their lifetime wealth, whereas 75% wealth is attributed to what they own (asset value) and land is an asset that grows in price. This has happened repeatedly to farmers in times of recession when markets are manipulated by inflation and deflation of markets. Anyhow, today farmers in Europe have much more advanced Mandi and Arhtiyas type of system which is known as the cooperative farming - which provide these necessary support services that farmers need. Bihar farmers have already gone through something similar and lack an agriculture credit system  is crippling their farmers. Keep the current system its is something that India should be proud of and it should be expanded throughout Hindustan. Jai Hind!"
2. It is fine that farmers can now directly trade their produce to corporates outside the purview of local mandies. In this context the following scenario ought to be considered.
In Punjab and Haryana Mandi system works well  But in south India its worst
"Safety net not always work for rich farmers, even FCI is not directly involved in procurement. It is entirely done through state agencies like PUNSUP PUNGRAIN MARKFED etc. First time your lecture was looks like half boiled egg."
On last Saturday yogi Adityanath and amit shah came to hyderabad and conducted huge rallies for GHMC elections. Where were the covid protocols then?
"Superb explanation brother. You made the confused topic look so easy n understandable. If MSP is ignored, it will only be the corporate families n the corrupt government who will be benefited. N we consumers & farmers will end up exploited and looted and helpless."
"Just house alone is ; what about food  , how do you expect farmers to produce at the cost of 1964 ; cost have gone up in everything ; you need to raise the price of food  that farmers can leave comfortably and give education and good health ."
" BEST ever explanation on YT about FARM Bill and also about MONOPOLIZATION of TAXI industry by OLA & UBER -->  how it may be linked to Agriculture as well - Worth spending 30 min , if U R interested "
Bhai ye sab bjp walo ne kia hai police ke support mein
"I wish and hope one day mainstream media will show us real truth till then I m not gonna watch news on tv ,it's better I watch your videos and learn something,bro u are awesome thank you for keeping us informed and showing the real picture of the ruling party , literally needs more people like you who are logical and assertive,may god bless you "

Rakesh Tikait Uncle ji..Great Personality ! 
Ab tak mai kisan andolan support nahi jar raha tha but these sikh farmer uncles motivates me am in tears how they are struggling now am with u
Punjab and haryana are the least productive state and they use both alarming amount of water
Congratulations to all farmers and remembering the ones who laid down their lives for this revolution..
"Finally, hope for farmers again. Farmers fought well, many lives were lost. Good luck to our farmers. Victory for farmers."
This fellow is well oiled by funds elsewhere that he can protests wherever directed by the sponsors. Not farmers but trouble makers but only restricted to one state and a portion of the middlemen.
"Today the consumer class is silent. Apart from Punjab and Haryana, big and small consumers in other states are also supporting Modi because they still have religion and nationalism in their mouths."
Then is this farmer's flag?
"PM Modi is quite good at communication. This matter really needs to be solved by proper discriptive communication and must remove any misconception if farmers have any ( cause we know their is opposite parties as well), bcoz this protest is not good for the farmers as well.."
"If it is very important like pm says in this speech. Then I would like to ask why he repeal this law though he know this law good for farmer. Then what make him to repeal this law, you willingly take away goodness of the farmer law what force you to do that."
"Sir, Our anndata (Kishan) protesting for their rights in the bill but our respectable prime minister modi sab justified Kishan bill today in man ki baat, Our PM giving his man ki baat to andhbhakt but not listening man ki baat of India's farmers man ki baat,he should listen to farmers."
Rakesh Tiket khud hi Daket hain cheap publicity ke liye kuch bhi bolta 
"Shame Delhi Police, Republic Day K Din Jaha High Security Honi Chahiye, Uss Din Koi Lal Qile Ma Chadh Gya, Aur Aaplog Kuch Nhi Kr Paaye?? A Big Big Failure Of Delhi Police.... Agr Farmer Protest ka Ya Haal Ha To Agr Terrorist Attack Hota To Aap Kya Krte??"
Ye ek nyi chal h ye jante h ki Kisano se bahot nuksan hota UP Election me isliye ek nyi chal chli gyi h is lolipop ko public samjhe jarur 
4. The whole thing about the personal relationship of the middlemen and farmers strikes me as a cultural thing in Punjab and Haryana. Maybe these state governments can continue to support APMCs.
Thank you BBC for put farmer voice
Mismatch of Supply and demand will be reduced. Since farmers will produce per negotiated contract. Over production of agricultural produce will be minimised.
India has indirect 100 crore farmers but we need <10 lack farmers 
"Dear andhbhakts, let's say Taliban murdabad, iam not saying it to show patriotism ,and I don't care about that,if your boss Mr. Modi and his government is against Tabliban then why they are talking with Tabliban in Doha (qatar)?If Modi government recognises Taliban as a legitimate government of Afghanistan then what will be your position?will you left andhbhaki or you will chant""""""kuch bhi ho baap to humara Modi hi hai!!!!!"""""""
"Farmers of Punjab get free water and electricity at the cost of taxpayers. If you're not a farmer, the cost of electricity in Punjab is the highest in the country. High electricity costs mean that no company will set up a modern industry in Punjab."
"When we looked, we found that only Punjab & Haryana farmers agitation is going on against farm bill. But South Indian farmers are totally silent, WHY? anybody having answer?"
Allah Ho Akbar  YA Allah Pak Rahama  show everyone's right way INsha'Allah ameen summameen from Pakistan  love you too much Taliban because they make Muslim government.. INsha'Allah they will be successful.. ameen summameen Allah Ho Akbar  I request do other Muslim please don't fight with tham you should support them for Allah Pak please think about it nicely and don't listen to non Muslim about that and don't kill each other please do respect each other..
Modi govt should pay all damages because they never consult farmers before imposing law
"Looks like in states of punjab and haryana, there is great ""teamwork"" happening between traders, farmers and state governments.  So the Center should roll out the present AGRO REFORMS but allow the various State Legislative assemblies to give a thumbs up or thumbs down to it.  Punjab and Haryana and some parts of UP want to continue the current STATUS QUO and their State Legislatures will deliver that to them.  In ALL other States of India, the AGRO REFORMS have been very well received especially those who know what is there in these AGRO REFORMS."
Why are there only a certain section of India farmer protesting.
Allow other parts of country to test this farm bill which has nothing to lose at this point.
Go Indias Farmers. Inshaallah You succed in your struggle
It means farmers are free from Mandi dalals exploitation now  good news
We support farmers 
This all political drama by Congress party and farmers
Free all the farmers in Jail
By listening this video we have to stand with our farmers..
Atleast only NDTV good telecast we people india saport farmers 
summary -- educate farmers and reduce corruption.
You always talk of both the sides but in this video it was one sided many famers have exploited their lands by doing aggressive agriculture they dont want to pay taxes and plus need minimum support price also they are not completely wrong but there is always a grey part its not always black or white
I couldn't find more honest and well articulated explanation of farm bills.
Bringing down our tricolor flag in republic day is not acceptable whether he may be farmer or nothing else now whole india will understand who they are what they are trying to do what they did now their slogans was nt related to farmer protest
"We need India back,save India from Bjp"
Still supporting the bill. Not Indian farmers just Punjab political activist not farmer.
Victory of farmers against ravana
"It's very sad about the farmers plight, but PM is adamant seems he does not listen to any one, does what he does best, only diverts issues all the time."
"So once the farmers commit suicide the debts are forgiven? Do all farmers have life insurance that will pay out the family to cover all debts, and feed the family?  I call the people who leave behind the women and kids cowards.  The men of Punjab consider themselves Lions.  I think not.  What will happen to the family when you commit suicide Lions?"
elected in  assembly election of Punjab  .
At this time Sriman ji government of yogi and Modi.
Aarbaz Chutia 1st Ambani Gehu Nahi bez tha hai thik. 2nd Contact Farming is some how the best for Farmers. MPS Is Perfect. 
"In over 20 days, more than 22 farmers have died. The priority should be to diffuse the situation. One solution is to enact new laws incorporating the substantive demands of the farmers which government has virtually agreed to and also incorporate a repeal clause in it annulling the three existing reform laws. The new enactment and annulment shall happen at the same time, thus meeting the demand of the farmers and government retaining its seemingly fragile and recalcitrant prestige. "
"If the farmers want to suffer, let them. What else? Finally, it is the farmer who lost."
"* Government will repeal all 3 farm laws, it's in Parliament's Winter session."
How dare that policemen beat a farmer who is so old... How dare to beat the person who gives us food
Even after this if Andhbhakt will defend BJP then u guys really shouldn't call urself Indian.
I think farmers are protest peacefully but there are some external interfance who only saying that they are farmers but actually they are not .btw who knows
I am Farmer & I support my Brotherhood (Farmers)
Understood now . Need to give some Power to farmers  with encouraging efficiency
"Democracy literally means the government of people. If half of the majority are not happy with the act then take it back, that's all we are asking. Indian govt are really acting like a monarch smh"
"I didn't see any farmers in that ""rally "" ..all I saw were goons..."
"It's so funny during CAA protest, delhi riots, everyone blamed one person Tahir Hussain, and now this police officer doesn't want to take one person's name. It's a sad sad day in our country. Only way to show solidarity with farmers is by  coming to roads. All Indians come together in each state in each village in every road. Everyone all at once ! This nation needs to be protected from the current goons ruling our country and not our protestors!"
Sir you are disgracing farmers agitation by calling it political. What is the use of MSP if procurement is not gurrenteed?
Who needs a spokesperson when you have media channel like India today supporting them. 
all the Modi supporters are super happy with your video SG. I think it will be good if you get a very competent journalist like P sainath who has been reporting agrarian crisis for decades and you both have a live conversation in YouTube. It will bring both sides of the protest together rather than monologues on one aspect by either side
#nofarmernofood #kissanmajdoorektazindabad #downwithcapitilism #modimustresign #isupportindianfarmer
The law should cover head load goons in Kerala for bleeding the farmers
"Q1. Why did Punjab farmers not shift to edible oil crops (rapeseed, sunflower etc) inspite of MSP?"
India Today has become a spokesperson for BJP
i am from Vancouver Canada. i support all farmers and request Modi to take one bill back and fix the glitches where farmer has more power!
Terrorist are briefing in press conference but the prime minister of. India not.       JAI KISSAN
"What the agitating farmers could not achieve  by their prolonged agitation, could be done by Capt. Amarinder Singh. I think it is largely the efforts of the Captain coupled with election politics ,which led the Central Govt to reconsider the issue to pave the way for Captain's victory in Punjab election. No political party however can claim a role in this issue. Enough hints were already dropped by him in advance about the course, the Central govt needs to take.But how a small fraction of farmers have become a block to larger section."
Rakesh Tikait says so simply and straightforward about the situation
"I might be the only person in comment section who get affected by new farm bill. Please note that india isn't isn't small country by population and size, every state is like a different country with different challenges. These new bills are only affecting millionaire farmers of state called Punjab (some parts of adjacent states). Similar kind of farm laws are already implemented in some states and no one gives a damm about it. And majority of REAL farmers don't have any problem with new laws or never will. These protests are organised by political rivals of current goverment and khalistani supporters. Trust me I'm a farmer and I don't have a day to waste with these goons."
        farm law bills!
"Overall, it seems to be a step in the positive direction for the farmers. The middlemen have a lot to lose. The common man may feel the pinch but with private players coming into the field, the agri sector will get a huge boost. This will be very good for the country. The private players will only come in the agri sector if they see profits. With many private players coming in the agri sector, prices will be decided by demand and supply."
"Finally, The consequence of any decision can be seen only when it's implemented but once privatization is in place, Agricultural market is open for competition for fair price market is also a theory which can be given support by minimum purchase price."
"Second point, the govt needs to understand that even china is shifting from service sector to manufacturing sector. We cannot be the phone factory of the world but we are definitely set up to be the food bowl pf the world, the govt needs to ensure and point her farmers towards goods that have international appeal . For example, bio fuel can be made from sunflowers,mustard etc but right now we dont have a mandi system for it. This will also relieve indians from petro prices etc. Second is palm oil,corn syrup..all western foods have it and india can definitely do wonders. "
Now our beloved farmer vir das will be happy .....I'm a farmer's son and i know these laws  were need of hour ....but tikait like so-called farmer who live luxurious life hijacked the farmers mind for their  middleman masters ....now no govt will bring these laws ..n nothing will change in life of farmers..they will remain poor like always.. by these laws there was a little hope perhaps something can change in farmers life.....but back to same hole ...
Good job uncle ji from Haryana whose showing Identity Proof of his to verify that he is from Haryana. Hats off. Savage Haryanavis. Love from Punjab 
"Congress party is not at all bothered about either our country or welfare of it's people .Their only motive is politics.  Whatever BJP does to uplift the country ,Congress only wants to oppose it because they want to spoil the image of BJP for next election. Those who support Congress are also equally responsible."
"After 11 round meeting, farmers are still at their stand, and 26 of jan, what happened every body know."
With the Technology and New ACTs Actually farmers can be Price makers with online Platform for Farmers to sell their products. 
It's Duty of PUBLIC ...To help FARMERs.... not GOVERNMENT 
What are your suggestions on Farm bills and Agri reforms? Comment below!
Best Analysis on repealed Farm Laws.
"Farmer sowed seed, God Jesus n bible is a seed of god's word satisfied ur soul by His death n ressurrection. C 'Bible' in google!!!....."
Sir In my perspective there should be a group of persons from farmers side and a group of police officer who can coordinate themselves and take one particular group ahead ...
"Why media giving un- nassery coverage  to rakesh tikait,why don't u keep him aside,till election,"
"Rahul Gandhi Zindabad Priyanka GANDHI JI, ZINDABAD Our beloved Gandhi family.. Save this country from RSS BJP God bless you."
This channel did not show the main sentence which said that the only thing being discussed was farmer's laws. He was dismissing the khalistani or violence link. And that is good.
Another Masterstroke by Modi As per Andhbhakts n Godi Media.
Every  punjabi  knows  what  is written in 3 page bill we have very  intelligent  person  in Indian  parliament  called Bhagwant mann  who explains every  clause  of the bill in detail
Aare sir abhi election ka time hai... Isliye sarkar busy h parchaar mai...
"If you want to stay poor, not Modi, even god cannot help. Let the farmers decide their fate now. Getting carried away with fools is the best solution for them as of now, but they'll repent for their unethical mindset and behaviour later in future."
Farmers marc ..only Sikhs hariyani and west up farmers Marc.. Excluding these farmers all farmers wants farm laws..
Now farmers are also termed terrorist... Jiska khate ho usi ko dikha
"Har ek andheri raat ki ek sunhari subah bhi hai, we should stand with our beloved farmers."
Why the farmers don't have a cooperation?
Kisans did not have problems with farlaw.   they had problems with the injustice with the farm law as how they brought into.  .
i belong to a farmer's family and i support farmers but not khalistanis
Now modi supporters should regret
"It is very wrong to connect Deep Sidhu with BJP. You are indirectly blaming the government for the violence so that they can use it as an excuse, this is unreal. All the unions together representing the farmers. While protesting all the unions are one unit and when there is a mishap they are separate."
Support Indian people
"250 million good joke.. I live in Delhi, and my assessment is this protest never saw support of even 25 million farmers. And even 25M is not even 2% in India."
Let's stop calling them kisan and call them Khalistani terrorists now
"* Farm size- the average farm size in India is 1.3 hectare. While in Australia its 800 hectare, Argentina 518 hectare, Canada 315 hectare, US 250 hectare, UK 86 hectare, so the average Indian farmer only has 1/50 - 1/500 of the land a farmer elsewhere will exploit, to generate an income."
First of all yes Taliban is a terrorist background& there ideology is similarity of terrorist ideology & yes they are terrorist. India doesn't recognize Taliban is a Afghanistan government at least present time.
Punjab farmers are anxious for losing Easy money they have got so used to on the back of unsustainable farming practices supported by populist govt policies...
"And if don't know, I let you know that out of 37 states and union territories only farmers of 2-4 states are protesting against this..."
"Farmer disputes (market prices, contract farming etc) matters cant taken up by the court. Only up to SDM. Seriously? So basically farmers have to rely on corrupt SDMs to solve their matters with corporations like adani & ambani."
Democracy win ....farmers win 
Farmers are a pride Of india sharam ani chaiye apko kisan ke sath asa krtey hue
Kisan are not under stand thebill. Congrssi kidanoko vadka rahie only for votes
We support farmers... 
Modi has thrown india into dark ages.
States are losing revenue...why farmers are revolting
I support Indian farmers 
India national media is under central government
"Excellent , truthful and very bold analysis by Iyer . We need a strong leader like Yogiji. Not a leader who takes unilateral wrong decisions for the entire country. No excuses, no defending of the indefensible blunder. What a great shame. Death is better than living in humiliation ."
Poor farmers eventually got succeeded their passionate  efforts against the Law has set an example for other who are struggling for their rights congratulations to farmers and their supporters and sympathisers
"You are killing farmers in Delhi and and other places indiscriminately,  there is no problems on that,  right????"
"This is sad. Most of the remarks said this.  But did any single body seen supporting these laws? We were only seeing only Takait n Gang and Pappu gang. After repellment of laws, only protesting farmers are being hailed. Not a single interview of farmers who were supporting these laws being shown. So, ultimately Govt had no other way."
"Bhaji thank you very much for supporting us.......people who still think that WE are wrong....must understand that NO FARMERS, NO FOOD "
"Prof.Gulati says Prof.Modiji could'nt convince farmers of the reforns!Its difficult to believe because Prof.Modiji ,it appears ,had written  and publised a book"" exam warriors '  "" for  students appearing for exams on how to  control stress and examination fear!"
you guys are same for the country.  election harne ke dar se kanoon hi badal dia govt ne.  usko support karoge.   by hook n by crook.  n BBC has wasted  my time with this video.
You can't defeat a TRACTOR using cane mr Indian police
Inko thokna shuru karo ya sab political parties ka tools ha crackdown karo in chuyltiyo pa I am farmer for himachal pradesh .
Most shameful day for our country. These can't be called as farmers but rather terrorists.
Many Congratulations to the farmers of the Country. 
"Hopefully, all the states except Punjab,  will bring in the same farm bills which are supported by 80% of the rest of the Indian 'real farmers' . Reassess the MSP for Rice and Wheat food grains which are over supplied and affecting water supply. Modi should come clean for the real reason for repealing the farm laws to regain people's trust  and the people have a right to know."
"Good to see the unity. Tight slap on GODI MEDIA FACES, BHAKTS and the Useless Bjp government. Shamed Internationaly."
Farmer zindabad pls  I request all farmer pls don't trust this man he his  a big lier Now he know BJP will b no more in country
Why only farmers from punjab and haryana are protesting??
Vox covered more news about the farmer protests than Indian media itself.
World great leader Modi Ji
Difference between khalistan protest and farmers protest the whole India want to know about this
"Well, Half knowledge given is as much Dangerous and Threatening. Elaborate more on the Farmlaws word to word rather than assuming vague media statements as the sole truth. you also forgot to address the Khalistani (separatist) elements that have grown into these protests. "
1st time came through your channel.. nice explanation. Every thing is there. I understand both govt and farmers. Farmers basically worried for their security.
Support farmers.. No farmers No food
These laws are for corporates only....not for benefits of farmers
Actual farmers are working in their fields. These brokers are getting funds from Terrorist group like Kamishan and ISI.
The  farmers wanted to utilize  the difficult CORONA situation in  India. It is not justifiable.
Give example of bihar where this type law was made in 2006 and how has been bihar farmers are now destroyed
It was NOT violence - it was MIRDER by BJp who ran their vehicles from the back while farmers were leaving the protest PEACEFULLY
Main us ka president farmer law support krta hoon 
"The main issue isnt that Punjabi farmers dont trust the central government, its that Mandis are much MUCH larger in Punjab and Haryana then anywhere else in this nation and Mandis will become weaker due to these bills and many farmers even in these states are happy with these bills, this is because that cost of transportation is reduced and proper infrastructure would be provided by the private player and talking about the MSP, you can find out the MSP which the government provides on their website, the MSP has increased compared to last year"
Its sad that Mr ravish Kumar had not even tweeted or posted about this incident on his social media handle.
Haryana me sir tuta he.. UP me hota to g@@nd tod deti yogi police. 
"Farmers win, Government losses"
I am not a modi supporter but these laws were kind of game changers. This is really sad. The farmers of this country will always remain poor.
#isupportfarmers 
India and Russia will support to panjshir i hope hope this is going to happen
"Goosebumps at 0:51. Jo Bole So Nihal, Sat Sri Akal . Jai Hind. Bas mere pyare Sikh bhaiya naal yhi ardaas hai..kisi political party k behkawe me mat aana aur na hi violence karni h. Love from Haryana. Was a modi/bjp supporter earlier but this kisan movement opened my eyes."
Modi government needs this kind of protest because they ignore Farmers. Ab sab chhanga lag raha hai mujhe. Jai Hind Jai kisan
Support to farmers .
"Taliban are quick learners version 2.0 Learning from Israel,  China and India. How to control protestor?"
Respect to all the farmers who have worked hard to get their rights back in this modern era 
"Please make detailed video on present farmer scenario, luved this VIDEo"
I am sure 90 percent of u who are supporting Farmers Don't know what exactly are Farm Laws...
It's just a khalistan and muslim and Congress aap sponsored game.
2. If the farmers have belief in MSP system why can't the government give written assurance on Msp in pvt market.
She is just opposite to what Godi Media reporters act like .... She is just reporting the facts not acting like others
