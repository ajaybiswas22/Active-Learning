"She had explained the things well but finally end up in a erroneous conclusion. Definitely there are lots of issues with current APMC systems. Bt the new acts are going to worsen the situation further. Now onwards the farmers needs to bargain with more powerful purchasers than earlier small traders. The small/medium farmers wouldn't have any bargaining power with big corporates. If the intention was to make MSP mandatory in every private transaction,  why did the bills not contain a clause that the price paid to the farmer by the purchaser shall not be less than the notified MSP?. That's why lakhs of farmers are on the streets. "
No this is not justified!! Farmers have no right to do this especially on Republic day!!

The government approved for unlimited storage for some food items if this happens then the supply will fall and demand will rise and with the demand the price of these commodities will also rise
"3) In the video it is already mentioned that cartelization and teaming up happens in APMC markets today, so what is the sense in continuing with the same system and support more middle men who do not let the farmers get the worth of their hard work & toil?"
"I didn't see any farmers in that ""rally "" ..all I saw were goons..."
You should have given a little focus on the states who already have this new system implemented for a long time for e.g. Bihar. Has there any improvement in the State of Farmers of Bihar ? No.

There is a concerted effort by Godi Media and GOI agencies to not show the depths and seriousness of this protest. So ordinary citizens across India has not understood the gravity of situation for farmers - the hand that feeds Billions in India including the rich and common.

*First he did for farmer's but now for the Country try to understand it in depth*
Jai jawan !! ( most of them farmers sons )!!!
Only 4% of Indian Farmers get MSP (and assured government procurement). Other 96% don't get it. That's why UP & Bihar farmers do labour in Punjab and Haryana. Now Modi government wants the farmers of Punjab and Haryana also to become migrant workers.
"Repealing the 3 laws clearly points out to the fact that the government has succumbed to political pressure, vote Bank looking at the state elections but it is definitely not a good precedence as other laws like CAA and 370 await the same outcome which indeed will further fuel andolans,dharnas,blocking roads creating nuisance  in the name of resistance ..We  can't afford this to be a norm."

Tikait sir you ate really great and you deserve to be a leader of true farmers. I salute you. Jai Jawan Jai Kisan
