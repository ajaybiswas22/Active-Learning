Now the day will come when small farmers will cry and learn a lesson 
You made an assumption that farmers are getting the fair price from the middlemen. Any data to back it up?
.................. Will be back soon for the betterment of farmer's rights 
80% of Indians dont know what are these farm laws first they should know this
"The laws were for farmers benefits however the protest was high jacked by outside countries who wanted to bring instability in India once revoked there plan to create instability failed, Narendra Modi is the best, intelligent and beloved prime minister of our country, he knows nation matters mostJai Hind.."
Sorry but this time I am against the farmers 
"Rakesh tikat fake   , bicholi, broker of bipakshi birodhi ... May not have ploughed and hard worked ever in the fields to generate produce low cost yeild fasal for small tenant farmers."
Farmers to Police:Unoreverse Card
Great farmers protest!! Let their concerns be addressed without further delay!!
"Most of the people don't even know what the bill is all about. People are hating and supporting the bill blindly. We need farmers bill, but few adjustments can be made accordingly as per famers request. You can't simply reject the whole bill."
I m a farmer also we need change
Main us ka president farmer law support krta hoon 
"6. Food security undermined? Right now our buffer stocks are 90 million tonnes of food grains while we need only 41 million tonnes of food grains. Therefore we are already food surplus. We are now producing 1.75 kg food grains per capita per day, while we need hardly 1/2 kg (500 gms) of food per capita per day. In addition our Nominal protection coefficient is on an average 0.87 indicating that we can export and earn 13 percent higher price abroad. Therefore all the 3 laws are useful for farmers. There may be need for some small changes such as approaching civil court for dispute resolution, and these may be accommodated. Else the entire Act in its entirety is helpful to farmers."
"What I don't understand and would like to know is: If agriculture involves 60% of people of our country,why it is the farmers of Punjab mainly and of Haryana,Western UP are only agitating ,when farm laws would have effect on all the farmers of our country. So the question is Do they represent the entire farming community of India?. It is also obliquely hinted as to how Late Vajpayee ji would have dealt the issue."
This is not farmers this is khalistani tattu...
What is market price ? Modi should explain how a farmer can fix price for his produce using these laws ..
"I have tears in my eyes, you go girl! #farmersprotest"
"Communists wanted to develop Afghanistan from a stone age country into a modern one, the afghan people said no and with the help of the USA they defeated the afghan socialists and soviets, the afghan people then choose the taliban who allowed terrorists to use their country as a base to attack the USA, the USA invaded and tried to develop afghanistan from a stone age country into a modern one, the afghan people supported the taliban and even gave US weapons to the taliban, which caused the US to gtfo asap, the Chinese communists then become friends with the taliban and now want to develop Afghanistan from a stone age country into a modern one, i wish the red fools the best of luck"
Please support for Indian farmers and thanks BBC news
Deepest respect for the farmer brothers and sisters!
Solidarity with the farmers 
"In short, if mandi gives a better price, then farmer will sell in APMC and it will not collapse. But if private player offers better price, then why farmer will go to  APMC? it is useless."
Farmers are Punjabi and Haryana other states are  only small holdings
Hopefully....our farmers brother will welcome .. and help IND grow 
Proud to be a Indian......thanks to our PM modi to take brave decision 
"11:36 Rp Singh ji, I challenge you please visit any village of Patiala district and see yourself what farmers want here "
"I have supported farmers since day 1. But this is just unbelievable, This is not right. No one and Nothing should replace the the Indian flag."
We tax payers must protest giving all freebies to these unproductive farmers as it6wastage of our tax money
Literally such a set back..we want some improvement in these laws but entire repeal must not be done..
Police's action against farmers make them more aggressive. So stay back. And it's a warning to the modi.
"Sir, farmers are also not against this bill, until the promises from government are not only words in air. They just need an assurance in written that  MSP should be paid to them, and why government cannot add this point into the bill. Getting profit from privatization will be just a bluff."
Tikait and duplicate farmer's are responsible of  farmers death' jai Hind
"To the publication group, and anyone reading this from Scoop Whoop, I know that Samdish Bhatia is in centre of politics. He is not a Right Wing Supporter nor the Left, but I want to request you to make a totally separate series. With zero ads, zero promotions, zero sarcastic Samdish, you guys know that PMO India is doing very wrongful acts. Just 10 Videos of 10 minutes Samdish Bhatia seriously telling the exact truth he know, I am following Samdish from 3-4 years now and my gutt tells me that Samdish can bring the change. Samdish Brother if you ever read this comment I just beg you to do your serious MANN KI BAAT. You have the voice which people crave for, you have the viewership people dream of. Please Scoop Whoop and Please SAMDISH BHATIA. This decade can turn India back to what it was or to a gangland with riots every day every night. Samdish Bhatia you didnt got sold out to politician be fuckin* proud of yourself and bang this government. Respect your Reporting"
"I am from Pakistan and i think these new laws will not effect farmers, but if the intentions of the government was to make this just for the sake of rich corporates, then these corporates will definitely squeeze farmers and their familly."
Farmers power
And that's the reason I support these bills as most Indian farmers support them (including the ones from whom I buy vegetables and grains) except the ones at Delhi protesting..
This poorr farmer drinks cofee in 5 star hotel only
"Desh ke opposition parties are not positive, but negative approach...Mirror shows ugly face of opposition and it's negative impact on farmers. Farmers leaders are irresponsible and irreasonable ..Though I express my condolences ..Not a single famer died due to excesses of government but due to natural death. In fact farmer's leaders should compensate from their pockets. 95% farmers are looser.  Money power wins. Sad chapter for farmers."
India goes to the hell after taliban government hahahahaha 
Bcz cong got govt in punjab so they also got support from cpi n cpm
Sooner or later the laws are needed. Sorry the Jat farmers are not able to understand the laws.
I am Farmer & I support my Brotherhood (Farmers)
"Zero number to budget, I am Jagdish Babu Dubey from village Jaitpura tehsil Bharthana District Etawah as farmer, until unless purchaser not come to me to purchase my crops on MSP rate and payment will not come to my bank account directly from the purchaser"
"Finally, hope for farmers again. Farmers fought well, many lives were lost. Good luck to our farmers. Victory for farmers."
We Support You Farmers#Love From Kashmir 
I am from Bangladesh and I strongly support the farmers all over the Indian Subcontinent.
Govt should decide MSP on their own and make law that not mandi nor open market can buy below this.if they will then it wouldn't beneficial for farmers.
Farmers Are Soul Of Our Nation They're Poor But They're Not Alone Every Indian Are With Them
"Their concerns were 100% valid. Once you remove price guarantees, industrial farms can undercut everyone at a loss in order to drive them out of business before returning to whatever rates they want. That results in less farmers, less choice for consumers, and ultimately higher prices. That's not an ""emotional response"" that's economics 101 - the Walmart model. You only have to look at Australian cattle farming to see this in action."
Up and punjab mai election aane waale hai
What ..B.J.P.. has to do with.this ..Farmers protest ..
Now GODI will say these Kisan are all Khalistani . This is what happens when people are angry with BJP and GODI media has no balls to question the government. Jai Hind.
Kisan hate to Yogi-Modi bhi hate.
"Rubika is good in  justifying, BJP should send her to make the farmers understand."
"Well explained. I support these bills. Farmers are our gods, who provided food for us. They should be good always."
Actual video is of 45 sec and it's clearly visible that the cheep hitting farmer has a broken windscreen on driver side that means visibility was zero ans the people who attacked the jeep came into seen after 28th second fully armed with rods and swords. It was pre planed and now court enquiry will bring the truth. Watch the video again and again and to ican clearly see the smashed windscreen of the jeep hitting the farmer ...who attacked this jeep
