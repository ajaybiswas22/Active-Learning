"And general Dyer shot at people lathi charge is something usual ,happened a million times in Congress times too plus Congress can't talk about brutality if they didn't forget period of emergency under Indra Gandhi , operation blue star or the shooting of farmers at a protest in 1998"
If they are real farmers beating is wrong.
These are no farmers. They are the same middlemen who has caused farmer poverty in the first place. These middle men are politically motivated and must be crushed at all costs.
So india is saying Pakistan army and isi defeated USA & nato and soviet forces
I remain Abhijit s fan but I do think I will give Modi ji more credibility than he is giving for this decision. This is Air India moment for Abhijit 
Please explain? I am humbly asking? I learnt that punjab cm passed an ordinance against these very new farm laws which means that these new farm laws will not be applicable in the state if Punjab. If not applicable in punjab then why the fear is there?
"Ravish the Mahapanchayat  was,  mark my words a day history of this country will remember when we look back in the history of India. Naturally the historians who are writing the present day will try to write otherwise. The farmers have given the message loud and clear and even if for graceful exit if not for politics the government should pay attention to their demands. If not,  Vinashkale Viparit Buddhi will be so apt and fitting a proverb."
Congratulations to all brave farmers and brave news laundry team

Overall this bill will benefit adani and ambani and farmers will left with nothing and we can say that this is another master stroke by our PM to help their corporate friends.
Why don't the Kisan Leaders start co-operative forums for marketing of farm produce to avoid middleman and get fair prices. Amul is the best example in this regard.

"It is very wrong to connect Deep Sidhu with BJP. You are indirectly blaming the government for the violence so that they can use it as an excuse, this is unreal. All the unions together representing the farmers. While protesting all the unions are one unit and when there is a mishap they are separate."

"as usual...no discussion with ministers, no committee, no consultation with experts, no meeting with farmers... just come on TV and announce it,"
You must know that it is illegal to sell crops other than mandi (where agents take 5% commision and taxes are also there) that means farmer doesn't has right to sell his own crop where he wants and at which price he wants.
