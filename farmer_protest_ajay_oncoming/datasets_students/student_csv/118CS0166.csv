Most important is our country development! Our Farmers should support with Center Government with best proposal for their betterment as well of our India! Jai Hind!
One minute silence for those who doesn't read farm bills and make a decision 
Present youth should learn from our great fighters our farmers
"Waiting to see how this plays out, full support for farm reforms and PM Modi"
6. The Adthi can also become a private company. They will buy the crop from the farmers.
FARMER - Back bone to our country.
"This pseudo farm protest is up against our beloved PM, the democratically elected govt, but aayega to Yogi ( 2022 ) and Modi (2024) hi.  Kuchh bhi kr lo salon desh ke gaddaron Khalistani gang."
"Why they are not fulfill farmers demand the BJP cross  every limit yr pls be safe and wear mask ,this is not right time pls be safe"
Air India sale: Modi govt's first privatisation in 7 years; what...
"If Indian farmers block traffic and protest in my country like that, I will send my request to government to expatriate them."
2. Government has limited fixed allotted money to buy produce from farmers at price fixed by government. So rest produce is purchased by middlemen at much lower price.
Did you forget to mention that Greeta tweeted a toolkit which supported Khalistan considered to be terrorist in India ??
"Farmers, no need to talk much.  Since the police whack you, just whack back."
What's the guarantee the corporates won't end up exploiting the farmer...?
"Oh... We have a Supreme Court.. After more than 500 Death in the protest our Justice system finally started speaking.. Respected Supreme Court , request you to do daily basics hearing on case and 24*7 and make it live .. Save our farmers .. Jai Jawan Jai Kisan."
"We BJP supporters must realize that this was more of a national/internal security issue than political. Although this move is bad for the nation's progress, lets just back modi for now."
These farm laws were not there for last 50 years but farmer suicides were there. There is no correlation between these two things. I dont know why people think that if these laws are taken back things will be better.
Rakesh tikket is criminal shame he represents farmers
Delhi Police Leaders should resign for Police Brutality ... Farmers Lives Matter
Madam didn't explicitly mentioned the interest rate which is paid when credit taken by farmer in distress from arhatiyas..
"AIMs very last statement was a strong humor, but that is a reality, the way Modi disappointed this time, IslamoChristianity is looking very possible, it doesnt need 25 years any more, it will be in next 3-5 years, Modi should have resigned instead of repealing Farm laws. I am taking depression pill now. Sad, so sad. I need to consult doctor"
"I wonder if the farmers have considered making a national union so they can all agree on minimum prices that theyll sell to markets, its possible that companies could try and buy crops from other countries but I reckon theyd eventually cave due to transportation costs"
#istandwiththepanjabfarmers hope it all works out and gets sorted ASAP!! WJKKWJKF 
First time modi government take decision against farmers sad for this
First of all this is not modi's farm bill it is represented  by government of india
I m feeling proud that i m the daughter of farmer  congrats to all the farmers ..
Farmers biggest march against Modi. Better than outsourced brahminical headed IT. Look at the unconnected losers muted: Narayana Murty Nilekani Ambani Tata who are day trading.
Atal ji got voted out of power and congress bled India almost to death after that. Does aim think this is china? At any cost we need BJP back dont we. Theres literally no hope for india without that.
"Your wording ""few lives lost"" is humiliating to the farmers.Around 900 farmers lost their lives and for you it is ""few lives"". What sort of reporting is this?"
Bang on farmers
I'm from a farmer family based in Gujarat.... I was lucky I got a chance to study in Canada and also explore other countries around the world.... Farmers in western countries are making millions and they work through a system that Indian government want's to implement.
2. you spoke about MSP . In the Mandi system only 6% of the farmers were benefited with MSP or only 6% of them sold their crops at MSP price or above. (stastics from Sharada committee  
I am not a modi supporter but these laws were kind of game changers. This is really sad. The farmers of this country will always remain poor.
Thanks for telling truth. May god bless you. Love from punjab and haryana.
Kisan deshdrohi aur media deshpremi wa re wa dirty politics
There are some farmers protecting police officers but no police officer is protecting any farmer.
Modi should resign for not repealing the 3 black laws in time. What a shameful coincidence or is it Political Engineering as the Black Laws are repealed as the Sikhs celebrate the birth of Guru Nanak Devji the founder of Sikhism. Sweet Venom.
Guys don't worry that's new normal in new India under the gundagardi of our beloved modi ji and bjp.
BJP ministers Car rally at roads will clear highway 
Thank you for good journalism   godi media need training from vox
Its in better interest of india to not throw stones in bee hive ( taliban )
Also a word of thanks to team NL for their consistent and committed coverage of the struggles of the farmers.Thanks again.
"1. MSP (Minimum Support Price) is not applied everywhere (that is why these protests are mainly by farmers from Punjab, Haryana and western U.P.) and is given to only 23 crops of which the govt. only has a guaranteed buy scheme for two crops, i.e. rice and wheat. This means that no matter how much rice and wheat is brought in the APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committee), the govt. gives a guarantee that it will buy all of it. "
Kisans did not have problems with farlaw.   they had problems with the injustice with the farm law as how they brought into.  .
"Thousands of farmers die every single year.. no tweets by rihanna or greta on that. But the government wishes to bring new laws to increase the earnings of small farmers, a certain group starts protesting against the reforms and an ecosystem developes.."
Support farmers of india
Will it not encourage more such unlawful  agitations  of blocking roads indefinitely  going forward to repeal any law by  any group of persons who has objections on any law  but do not want to discuss or listen to courts ?   as this has now set a dangerous precedent to all such agitators. Even after this announcement the strikers are indicating that the agitation will continue and now raising  more demands to be met and want the laws to be passed in parliament  before they withdraw which means that they do not respect or believe  in the PM's statement . This is not all looking good .
Best explanation about farm bill in YouTube well done ma'am and your team 
I don't see any farmers here
There's no need of military intervention by India. We don't have enough financial power like the USA. We don't need to spend billions in a war torn country. We've enough issues at home 
"Thank god, finally a video from your channel which raises Farmers concern. Thank You Sir"
*Farmers going on a fast for a day* 
The people of Afghanistan will never accept being ruled by this terrorist group.  In time everyone will see how determined the Afghan people are. Taliban will be sorry.
Good desegion taken by PM & now don't think about farmers live on their own life and PM must think only about country security and there party growing in feature
To end you said I want something in some price before produce  lock in price   .... gap between farm an fork
"Dhruv bhai, I was watching you and other news and wanted to share my family's experience. So, my family grows spices, turmeric and coconut and only seasonally mangoes. Our family shifted from paddy almost seven to eight years ago. Block development officer visit all farmers in the panchayat. He gives advice on which seeds to sow based on how much has been taken by other farmers as there may be a glut as everyone is growing same. But many of our neighbours do not listen to block development officers. We become dependent on MSP in case of paddy wheat some pulses etc."
