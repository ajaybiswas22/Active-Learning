"Madam, there is one fundamental mistake in your video. Tax given by traders in APMC Mandi and not by farmers. double check your facts before making such videos."
Why are there only a certain section of India farmer protesting.
"Your caption ""Prime Minister announces HUGE RELIEF to farmers is Inappropriate. Change it.  Your caption is made to appear as if the farmers have been /are undergoing the sufferings due to unjustified misdeeds of someone else and the Prime Minister has come forward to eradicate the sufferings of farmers"
Jo v hota h achhe ke liye hota hai..you guys are fighting not only for farmers but for india
"I don't have enough economic and farming acumen to definitively have an opinion on these bills, but from this video its apparent neither does Mr shekhar."
"These laws will be good for agriculture but bad for farmers. 95 % of small land holders will have to exit farming and join the ranks of daily wage earners. On the other hand  , agriculture and traditional farming as we know today will die a natural death. A new order will replace the existing one."
Indian farmers we proud with u
Support farmers. Boycott reliance jio and other ambani adani products
This provatisation will being innovation to farming and promote plant diversification modi is best these pajeet manjeet singh run towards kanneda who dont even gove msp they have private farming so why they oppose these bills ?
"Congratulations to Farmers, country is with them"
these are very small portion of farmers in which u can see alot of khalistani and shaaheen bagh muslims. clearly it is politically motivated.
We support farmers  modi is wrong about the bills as its unethical
This is a very peaceful protest. We support the indian farmers.
"Sir, Our anndata (Kishan) protesting for their rights in the bill but our respectable prime minister modi sab justified Kishan bill today in man ki baat, Our PM giving his man ki baat to andhbhakt but not listening man ki baat of India's farmers man ki baat,he should listen to farmers."
Why Farmers had to do this?
Why the petrol & diesel price increase several time disfavour of people ? Effect in this regards is feel the people of India.
Now each farmer (protesters) will become billionaire 
Not a Farmers movement at all.
well government must ensure the corruption free farmers system..and  looking at the current agriculture situation.....all three laws are indeed necessary to bring revolution in farming and make farmers well connected to the business world so that they can increase their income ....but all i can see these so called farmers agitation is in reality are  political moves ..or we can say its anti modi agitation nothing else..
Now big question is why farmer's are becoming poorer it's because their input cost is high compare to output (intensity ratio is high). Ideally that needs to be corrected by establishing channel to provide low cost farming. 
Even US farmers is suffering because of few corporation controlling the entire farming industry.
"This is not the victory of Punjabi farmers, its a victory of old ways of farming and old ways market. I usually don't agree with India's policy but this was something which would have thrived the Indian economy, Our Villages and the ways of our farmer sell their agricultural produce but this has showed something that farmers don't trust the regulatory bodies and private entities."
"Repealing farm laws is against development, but without change how will govt double the income of farmers upto 2022."
"Vallabhbhai went to Bardoli for the help of the farmers, one protesting lady called him Sardar"
"So clearly explained, current farmer issue is specific & should be termed as Punjab Farmer issue"
"I wish and hope one day mainstream media will show us real truth till then I m not gonna watch news on tv ,it's better I watch your videos and learn something,bro u are awesome thank you for keeping us informed and showing the real picture of the ruling party , literally needs more people like you who are logical and assertive,may god bless you "
We support farmer.....
60 deaths in 40 days as protesting farmers fight the govt and the cold
These are not farmers n allotted route is different
I love Indian farmers!
"Aaj tak is a reputed channel and they should not invite fool people like rakesh tikait , iski baato me koi logic nahi hota hai. Kisano ke liye govt kuch aacha kare to isko prob , aur nahi kare to bhi isko prob .."
Poor mothers and sisters also the ones who feed us also on the road in the cold shame on the government stay strong indias farmers   
#FarmersBill #farmersprotestchallenge #GovernmentofIndia #IamWithFarmer #IamWithFarmers
  Or last me ye v likha hywaa tha ki Taliban reject all this ........
Sachi baat  ....if any party exist in India to demolish it's property then I think that party is CONGRESS  ....
"6. In Contract , private purchaser can amend price depending upon quality of produce.  Private purchaser is togive seeds, fertilisers , then in case yield is not as of excellent quality why right has given to Corporate to amend price?? Why farmer has to bear loss? "
"Farmers are the worthy sons of Idia, their grievance is a worth to be consider"
Imo indian govt should rectify these laws in some way to restrict pvt companies so that they can't exploit farmers. There are too many loopholes that can exploit the small scale farmers & farm land will eventually fall in the hand of those companies.
"This will be the big turning point. Modi's days are near. This is a Revolution, which was most required. Women coming on the streets is a victorious protest. Keep it up #Women of India you are the pillars "
I can clearly see the impact of godi media
Kisan are not under stand thebill. Congrssi kidanoko vadka rahie only for votes
"I think Central Govt should announce that a Committee headed by Mr. Satya Pal Malik will look after the issues related to agri , MSP implementation and all farmer related issues and will submit its report within 6 months. The SKM leader will immediately call the agitation."
Main reason for taking back these laws is inability to convince benefits to real farmers or we can say lousy attitude of real farmers to let these bogus agitators represent them
I am from Pakistan. but I am with these sikh farmers.
Now it is opportunity for youth to start companies for cold storage and packaged food like milk which will benefit farmer also and will increase exports
"*(Isliye godi media anchors ko public like nahi karti,tumhari news thik nhi hai... today what happened with  chitra  tripathi )*"
"Let's be clear on this farmers protest, it is only a small percentage of farmers that protested and large numbers are the middlemen. Ask yourself this question? If this law was evil why didn't the whole farming community of the country protest, that would have made more sense? In retrospect, this is a politically motivated protest same as the CAA and NRI Bill. The people are no fools, they are well aware of it."
It's more like Sikhs vs Govt riots..... Not farmers riots anymore......
"He is actually misleading to the ordinary Indian farmers. Tradition of dumping and throwing of own party members into the dustbin, not a new thing from their groups. reach to the degree of Dictatorship system?"
Indian government ko northern alliance ko support karna chahiye
"No zee news, india tv , zee Hindustan . None of them covering this. I can see NDTV"
"Sir apse kattai sahmat nhi,,how can u say that all farmers were against of it...."
"Whatever happened was not right, but completely blaming farmer and calling them anti-national is ALSO NOT  right This is the same DL Police which attacked STUDENTS sitting in JMI Library. Everyone here knows how the bill was made, passed. Mending things/ situations according to their comfort and sensibility"
You can see the intention of the govt right from the start when it goes with the ordinance route. Then where are those farmers and farmer orgs who approached govt and asked for these glorious pro farmer moves.these defintely didnt come from the farmer.you can watch such videos and get an inkling where these ideas are coming from.then in which privatization Is the right of one party to approach court taken away?.this  apec formula is already there in bihar.i think media needs to go and visit bihar and study the mess its agriculture is in.and what is this one market nonsense? Farmers and buyers with resources even now buy and sell from anywhere.now how to make it so that all farmers can do it needs govt setup storage and improve transport and infrastructure. The answer is not setting everything to be sold to corporates.
People need to accept MSP / Subsidies / Loan waivers/Tax. Breaks are short term measures not perpetually guaranteed policy... They have to go away with time once their short term goal is met... They are polices to support  not to bring incompetence... Today farmers in Punjab are well of thanks to MSP but that prosperity can't be ridden on Govt for all the times... MSP is a policy instrument and it can't be a perpetually guaranteed govt policy.. if done it would be an economic blunder in the long run... And for a Political party it won't hurt in the short run to make a MSP law just to be in power but it will create more problems for the future of the country as a whole...
Thank you for support our farmers
