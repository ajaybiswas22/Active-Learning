"Sir I am from West Bengal ,, Every year farmers have suffered in potato selling to the market ,winter is the appropriate season for potato cultivation .Every year farmers protested to buy their products and suffering a heavy loss to sell in not appropriate price .But in that time of year in  August-september - October months , the price of potato is going to much more high 5 times,6 times more the farmer selling price .we are trouble in every year in those times .And potato is very highly demanded vegetables in west Bengal in Durga Puja festival and all time in the year .sir plzzz if you read this comment ,,plzz make a vedio about it ....Thank you sir .Jai Hind ."
Question. Don't you think and worry about the cartels the middle men form deciding purchase price and farmers are left with no option but sell as produce will spoil rot after sometime and the selling price plummets further down and middle men take in more money?
"BJP government are doing wrong, this is Indian farmers not terrorist"
Finally a relief for farmers
"Farmers are not stupid ,give them tools and income they can produce miracles "
continuing tears of farmers is an curse for the country..
Also this system has been tested in western countries and farmers are suffering in those countries.
Appreciation of modi ji governance in their style.
"2:16 open auctions with transparent pricing this is the whole issue. Neither the auctions are open nor the pricing transparent. The arthias (dealers) group up in each mandi and decide a common highest bid, above which no other arthia will go. Ground reality is very different then theory. The arthias are bullies. And their is no real oversight in the mandis. The people who are meant to actually overlook the functioning of mandi and protect the farmers do the exact opposite. They team up with the arthias or more precisely, they issue the arthia license only to their family members/relatives to gain monopoly over the market."
Iske bakkal to assembly election k bad yogi ji tarenge
Sikhs no longer stand at borders for India as you though but now you all know they stand at borders to protect Punjab but if anyone gets past Delhi it's Indias own problem no Khalistan problem. The foreign investment for Khalistan shall be the n ira billions as we have taken over the block chain and creating cryptos that will keep all banks and invaders at bay. We are too smart for the world...just ask Britain government how very clever Sikhs. We build our wealth and now have the deepest pockets to take over economies and close them down 
Minister Nd PM has not come from Sky they all choosen by the public and this Government uncaring public and farmers..This is very disgusting..one day u feel it soon
With Farmers
But these rich punjab farmers earned lot of money.. just came for vacation...
Change your headline it's not Indian farmers it's Punjab farmers
Narinder modi big brother of Taliban
"One day, only we, the buyers will suffer the most. If the mandis are scrapped off in such a technical way, then the local street vegetable markets would vanish and we would be forced to buy only from malls, paying huge prices."
"Ye congress,sp vipacch Ka BJP ko harane Ka "
Difference between khalistan protest and farmers protest the whole India want to know about this
"Farmers of Punjab get free water and electricity at the cost of taxpayers. If you're not a farmer, the cost of electricity in Punjab is the highest in the country. High electricity costs mean that no company will set up a modern industry in Punjab."
"Like India always comparing itself with Pakistan and showing that we are growing faster than Pakistan, irrespective of other countries growing faster than us. similarly BJP always showing we are doing better as compared to UPA irrespective of amount of production."
"Congress party is not at all bothered about either our country or welfare of it's people .Their only motive is politics.  Whatever BJP does to uplift the country ,Congress only wants to oppose it because they want to spoil the image of BJP for next election. Those who support Congress are also equally responsible."
"It's d duty responsibility of one and all to protest against black laws, protest against evm, against godi media, against all contentious laws ..and make india, prosper as ever"
"There is lot of unemployment in Punjab and Haryana. That's why so many jobless people were available for protests. Ironically, cross-subsidy of farm electricity is driving away industries away from Punjab, causing unemployment."
Our government is really great they listen and do what the farmers want them to do really appreciate my government's work. No matter that farmers were wrong or may be right
@Dhruv Rathee.. i think you should post a video on current situation after government consideration and meetings with Farmers.
54+ Islamic (Muslim majority) countries in the world but not even 1 Hindu nation.
"Govt must stop giving free amount to farmers. Crores of rupees wasted by all government for appeasement politics. Govt must use MANREGA, FARMER subsidy for creating agricultural activity on WASTE, BARREN LAND under Govt. In India large lands are unable to use for farming- due to Natural calamities. Rain water wastage must be stopped. This land must be used for agri activity by using MANREGA & Kissan subsidy. Both these expenses are used by govt for cover up their economic manipulation. STOP tax payers money wasting. FREE FREE FREE ENOUGH. Every where free money is distributing. What is going on??   "
Brilliant explanation. Very sad that the bills have been withdrawn. All loss to farmers and end consumer.
Do you think the government is so dumb to anger the farmers? 
They are Tractor-Terrorists
Farmers will win. There is no other way.
Atleast only NDTV good telecast we people india saport farmers 
Ok modi will ask mafi for kisaan will the opposition will ask mafi for khalistani
Interesting thing is that most farmers unhappy with the laws are from Punjab and Haryana where the richest farmers of India live. Why isn't there any major protest in any other states???.
Eyewash for farmers ... Government thinks that people are stupid coz MSP is not gonna stay then why announcement been done now? How low can this government stoop down.
Excellent and balanced analysis of current issue of farm bills.   Govr is in fix.  Let's see what is the ultimate results.
"As mentioned by govt, that farmer can still follow old rules only. They have not been abolished. They still exist and can be chosen by farmers if they want"
. Canada needs to stand up to and voice support for the indian farmers
Jo 800 per quintals wheat buy kar rhe hai wo systematic exploiters hai aur inn law k baad farmers ko government aur exploiters ke alwa 3 rd option mil rha hai.   After seeing this video I accept education does not matter in politics because most educated CM is also trying cheap tricks.
Fantastic farmers  
In short the farmers have the option to sell their products wherever they get the best price - it could be a company or a direct consumer or any other market.
agreee i hope this issue resolves soon between govt and farmers 
"Such an excellent interview, NL team ! What a grounded, wise man is Rakesh Tikait!"
"This is a victory to Socialist Secular India.!! No to privatization, No to Corporations, No to Modi!!"
Govt itni gadhi hai....they don't realuze ki moment ander se kitna strong hai..baar baar atyachar karke they are making it more strong..last year chup chap oct mei..govt ne peacefully protesting ffarmwrs ki mange man li hoti..easily sab sab settle hota...i say jo log waha baithe hai...aur already itna dard jhel chuke hai..itne dukho ke baad ab ho ge hai fear less...fatoo sarkar...modi sarkar...isko yeh moment le dubega...meri har dua mei farmers ki jeet hai...
"Instead of farmers bills, long over due us Government should pass a law ""Death for Corruption"" as in China. Has  this government got  the courage to pass such a bill.?????"
Even after this if Andhbhakt will defend BJP then u guys really shouldn't call urself Indian.
We support farmers... 
These warehouse owner will make farmers wait until they crush buying price and then they will wait until they sky high the selling price!!
Thank God that this protest brought people from all walks of life together for the farmers.
