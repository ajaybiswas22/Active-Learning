"Overall, it seems to be a step in the positive direction for the farmers. The middlemen have a lot to lose. The common man may feel the pinch but with private players coming into the field, the agri sector will get a huge boost. This will be very good for the country. The private players will only come in the agri sector if they see profits. With many private players coming in the agri sector, prices will be decided by demand and supply."
"The print is supported by the special interest, and you are working for them. The long term plan is to get rid of most farmers and let big private corporation run the farms just like in western countries. Then the farmers have to work for them on minimum wages. The rest of them have to go to cities and live in small flats and pay rent and depend on the government for their living. This drama has already happened in western countries, and now is happening in India."
All should do a Google once to know the details of farmer suicides across the country for decades and the root causes....and which govts failed utterly
BBC has a double standard in reporting. I think the Farmers are peaceful compared to the Hong Kong riots. Yet BBC always reports Hong kong riots as peaceful.
"Fear of losing election in UP,  Punjab and other state results are visible now,  and loosing election will give cheaper petrol and diesel prices."
#isupportfarmers
Current Modi blunder is nothing to do with how the Bill was passed.
The andh bakths will justify this while eating the food that farmers were bleeding to make...
this law is already impliment in behar but  not benefits for formers so farmers of punjab take right step
When the ruling party breaks the rules of the house why should they be trusted by farmers with the new bill ?
They won to keep the farmers and theie lives like same as 70 years they are living
Most of the farmers give there land for cultivation on barter system
Now I  am loosing hope any hope in modi he is incompetent for hindutava
Rakesh Dacoit and his goons need to be taught a lesson
Over 95 percentage of tractors are owned by rich farmers NSSO report
Well done Modiji. We will see does our farmers need more per growth and that too directly to their account.  jai hind
One reason why I admire and Respect Yogi Ji is due to his strict action against culprits. Definitely voting for him. 
"'Der aaya, durust aaya' ka kya matlab hai sir !. Aap hamesha congress ko hi kyu support karte ho!  As a teacher, you should be a impartial and unbiased !!!!!!!!"
"The protesting ""farmers"" attacked their car , to get away from them all of this happened. The protesters caught them and killed 3 bjp workers and 1 driver."
"If the farmer's stick fell, he is asking for forgiveness. Because there are five states elections. This banda has started showing some drama again. Look through speech and gestures, it is clearly visible."
1. Fear regarding MSP ( Minimum Support Price)
I belive out of my Rs 30 aleast Rs 15 should go to the farmer
By listening this video we have to stand with our farmers..
All country stands with Rakesh takait ji and against RSS and godi media
Why only farmers from punjab and haryana are protesting??
We support farmers
"Shame on Indian  Media, Shame on Central Govt."
"Oh you must be happy , that what you guys called for and wanted . Shame on the people who were supporting these terrorists . Police must open fire on them and al terrorist symphatisors should be behind bars forever ."
Mr ravish saying there is no loud speaker on TRACTOR  NO protest will go on peacefully manner doesn't look whatever they said
"It's a peaceful protest, Mr. Justin Trudeau people of HK need your support & voice more than Indian Farmers.... Act mature."
Support to farmers .
This is the victory of our nation as a democracy. Kudos to everyone who supported this revolution both on ground and online.
I m from Pakistan Punjab i will support farmers .. shame on u Indian politics nd police
"A grand salute to all our beloved farmers. United we stand, divided we fall."
spoken like a true novice. The farmer issue is all about self interest of some people and political parties. If it was about the good of farmers the issue would have been buried.
Why Was & is Deep Sidhu's Farmer Union allowed to camp on police's side at singhu border?
I fully support the Indian farmers and who would not but not the protest. Poor farmers have been brainwashed and misled for mere politics which is why it's super imp that we research and bring out the truth to our misled farmers.
It means farmers are free from Mandi dalals exploitation now  good news
Good information about farmer
"My take on this.. When Amazon & Flipkarts came in,, we thought they would monopolize.. But see now.. You have Jiomart, tata cliq, nykaa, and many more may come.. So if we apply the same to Farming,, we can also expect many to come up, and would have eventually benefitted all.  Once we have a working model, then many would start it and would benefit both farmers, and corporates..."
We should respect farmers and especially from punjab haryana as they contribute a lot to our economy and also the sikh people are right in the demands. If modiji want to make india like Venezuela then we all cannot let that happen. We need to stand for farmers and we will fight till the end to ensure government withdraws this new rule.
"     The fear of these farmers may be real, but not substantiated by anything but speculation, despite reconfirmation that minimum price will be maintained.  In this battle the spirit of democracy need to win, which is not what most people think, it is the the freedom of choice of every one that needs to prevail, and not that of the mob(Wrong word to describe these peaceful worried farmers.. but to drive home a point). "
At the end it is farmers loss the protest were like that scenario where  Fruit vendor is selling a fruit for Rs 5 and the consumer is demanding Rs 10.
This is politics by all political parties. In the interest of the Nation Mr Modi has taken back the Agricultural Bill passed by the parliament.
"But currently our politicians are extreme corrupt. they increase their salaries at any time in parliament but don't want increase income of farmers. They got fund from corporate, then why govt or politician think about of farmers income growth."
support the farmers
"i would like to say I'M nuetral here because i dont know what the farm laws are but if farmers wanna protest they can and have rights to do it, but why do they wanna attack police officers i mean they can make fun of the govt and stuff they can burn down modi's posters all that is alright but pls dont attack police officers they are only doing their job u think they wanna do all this no its their job to protect their country and thats what their doing so please sont target police offficers, i agree that some of them are mad and doin inhumane things but most of them are not doing much."
So shocking that the farmers had to go through this.
"So once the farmers commit suicide the debts are forgiven? Do all farmers have life insurance that will pay out the family to cover all debts, and feed the family?  I call the people who leave behind the women and kids cowards.  The men of Punjab consider themselves Lions.  I think not.  What will happen to the family when you commit suicide Lions?"
Yogi is better than Modi that I feel now.
"If they feel guilty, they should abandon their comfortable life overseas and join them in profession..It's disheartening to see Khalsa flag instead of Indian flar fluttering. They should speak as indian not as punjabi, haryanwi or biharis..."
1. Why these were not taken back after 3 meetings with farmers and also arranged 13 seatings with farmers even though it was not taken back.
Its was delhi police who led the tractor march to delhi fort knowingly beacause . The police wants to make bad impression of farmers on people . And godi media is doing good
"Truly they were not hindu muslim sikh they were farmers,the last time British United Indians the same way ."
Even a simple farmer knows what's wrong with the laws and Agriculture Minister asks in the parliament what's wrong with the laws??. that sounds more like mischief rather than ignorance...
"Just house alone is ; what about food  , how do you expect farmers to produce at the cost of 1964 ; cost have gone up in everything ; you need to raise the price of food  that farmers can leave comfortably and give education and good health ."
