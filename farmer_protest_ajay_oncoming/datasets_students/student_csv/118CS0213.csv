Other farmers must protest and demand these laws .
Why don't you bring Modi and yogi and amit shah criminal rss related  data then we can believe you. Jai Bheem. Sat shri Akaal ji.
My salute to farmers let's election come we teach lesson to BJP
If the kisans dont want to end the agitation let them continue . Kisans form part of country. Tikait awaits orders from congress to end andolan.
Big victory for farmers.. modis draconian laws were forced to be withdrawn
Minister convoy crushed farmers to death that's the title.
"This farmers agitation will be remembered in the hundreds of years ahead. Congratulations to our farmers. Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan."
"It is not the victory of farmers , but the defeat of non farmers . Now non farmers will face the consequences ."
I feel very sorry for Prime Minister. He wanted to bring progress and prosperity to the farmers community. But these middlemen and arhtiyas gangs from Punjab and Western UP made his efforts go waste. The farmers from other parts of the country will never forgive Rakesh Tikait and Khalistani elements who stopped farmers from what they wanted.
"We demand Farmer's Protest, Demonetization, Liberalization of Indian economy to be part of our education curriculum. Jai Jaawan.. Jai Kisaan.."
"Maybe there are a few issues with the laws, but you can't outright ask to withdraw the laws that can potentially help millions of other farmers in the country. Punjab/Haryana farmers have already been benefitting for many years... you need to let others also prosper.. A federal govt has to look after the benefits of farmers in the entire country, not just one region... Think logically.. not emotionally..!"
Farmers sport
They hided  the farmers by saying agriculture is the backbone of Indiavery worst behaviour
MrModi exactly knows why he withdrew the farm laws 
i am from Vancouver Canada. i support all farmers and request Modi to take one bill back and fix the glitches where farmer has more power!
Punjab and haryana are the least productive state and they use both alarming amount of water
"That's what democracy means. That's how a protest should work. Their honesty, their unity, that's indian farmers. Rab is there!"
Its not hard. Respect democracy. Repeal the 3 bills. Simple.
Yogiji should start ethanol production in large scale in up let them protest jab ghar ayenge to baki farmers ko malamal payenge
Afsos. Kya hoga india ka if our farmers are denied their rights
Bhai ye sab bjp walo ne kia hai police ke support mein
There are there main parts in farm bill.
See how conveniently you have side stepped  the money power of the Punjab Aditya brokers and their hold on the Punjab farming  communities. The farm brokers are as powerful as the Zamindar- Army combination of Pakistan. It is time to smash this and only Modi is capable of doing it.
Farmers.. Protest.. 
"Government charge interest When Farmers get Loan to Buy seed and Fertilizer from Government ,"
* there is a steady decline in agricultural production as depicted @3:45 during the times when the archaic farm bill existed
"In Australia deregulation of the dairy industry has had many small farmers drop out. The big supermarkets have taken advantage. It is more expensive to buy 1 Litre of water, than 1 Litre of milk. India Farmers look after them as they supply your food!"
These  protests create history in india to protect our kisaan and our democracy
Why the farmers don't have a cooperation?
Farmers protest have Justice
Bjp govt has sold most of India govt owned facilities
One day .. citizens n farmers of India can understand ur point of view .. we r with u Modi Sir 
"When Modi brings something then you guys bent upon to paint him as dictator but when he corrects / climbs down you guys don't want to say that he respects democratic values eventhough it was a bit late. He don't want to give leverage to opposition and get united under Sharad Pawar. He also need to break the Khalistani leverage within farmer groups. The farmer protest could have lingered even for years with their illegal money flown from anti national movement. Of course, he needs consider overall propects of his political party as a prominent leader of it."
"Just curious, do Sikhs make up a majority of India's farmers? Most of those protestors belonged to the Sikh faith? Did Hindus farmers also protest against these agrarian reforms?"
" Basically, these bills are for the benefit of farmers. Ultimate goal is , farmers should be paid more, no more suicides, better and sustainable farming techniques, and more security of farmers interest."
But it is not good for farmers who want to change with time
Modi ji hav given an example of Democracy The repeal isnt good bt wht can be done.....
I am from a small village  I think this bill is also good for farmers 
Farmers are given full freedom to sell their products to any one of their choice.
Kisan indian hai aur tumlog deshdrohi ho.. shame on indian media rip to truth and reality...
Sanghis it's time u understand the truth stop supporting this extremist govt Jai jawaani Jai kisaan
"I might be the only person in comment section who get affected by new farm bill. Please note that india isn't isn't small country by population and size, every state is like a different country with different challenges. These new bills are only affecting millionaire farmers of state called Punjab (some parts of adjacent states). Similar kind of farm laws are already implemented in some states and no one gives a damm about it. And majority of REAL farmers don't have any problem with new laws or never will. These protests are organised by political rivals of current goverment and khalistani supporters. Trust me I'm a farmer and I don't have a day to waste with these goons."
"That's why in Russia people are supporting Navalny, Arab Spring happened, Trump' s Qanon is exposed and Trump is out. Please don't advocate Sam, Dam... ( Chankya niti). We need to bring morality in life and politics. At least good hearted people should not support it and ask better from their leaders. Sam, dam...brings selfishness, greed and puts country and humanity behind. Country becomes week overall. We must be responsible politicians and people. We all must reject ( and not "" enjoy"") sam, dam...niti. "
Dekho police walo ko bacha rahe the kisan or police wale kese mar rahe the kisaano ko
3 MSP ke sath sath MRP pe bhi agr sarkar decide kare according to production and storage etc charges consider karke to conusmers ko b faida rahega... middlemen ko hatane se zarur kisan and consumer dono ko faida hoga.. but MSP MRP fixed kare sarkar.man lijeye jo fasal 20 rs kilo khredi h woh 40 rs kilo se jada na bbech paye retailer.to black marketing and price hike apne aap control rahega
Yes it's against farmer and nation
Farmer-Mandi-Corporate
Finally farmers proved who this country belongs to. Kisan EKta zindabad
"Secondly, the cost of our produce  wheat, rice and sugar - to mention few is higher than the prevalent international prices. The landed cost of wheat at our ports from say Australia or Canada is lower than the cost of wheat transported from north India to south. The high price-tag as fixed by MSP, despite low labour costs, is due to higher cost of agro-inputs such as fertilizer (despite subsidy), cost of fuel such as diesel, agro-chemicals, agro-equipment. However, these issues remain unattended."
"I always supported ""farmers"" and I will support "" farmers""..that's it.."
"India is a very complex system where the middle class enjoy cheap food prices and farmers receive low prices for their crop as they currently are not allowed to store crop, pay high prices for inputs and don't have the ability to protect themselves with futures contracts. The current system in India is not sufficient to support all the small farmers in India (they lack the scale to produce, store and market their own products). A free market can only work, which these bills seek to do, if both buyers and sellers have equal bargaining power. Smaller farmers are not only lacking the skill but also the knowledge to effective participate in a free market. They free they will be crushed under low prices. The government should offer assistance and compensate for farmers harmed by these laws until the economy normalized. India need to grow beyond having millions of small farmers and the farmers need to accept their faith but I think the government did not do a good job in marketing these bills. Also, the people of Punjab are well off farmers compared to rest of India. If you look at the number of children being sent outside from Punjab to study in college, you would understand why punjabis are at the heart of the protest. They enjoy the highest income in the country from farming. Any threat to their lifestyle would bring about a reaction. Many of those protesting have on name brand clothes, Nike, Adidas, and drive Audis. These aren't the lowly farmers of Bihar."
"Just two minutes ago he himself told that MSP is a failure, and now he is saying that it is negative for farmers to not get the benefit of MSP"
India also not declared pakistan a terrorist state it doesn't mean that they are not. Sometimes geopolitics plays a role. If we can't declare taliban as a terrorist organisation it should be not taken as we like there policies.
Farmers never behave in this way.
I proud to be our farmers and ravish Kumar sir
"sir very good, but kindly brief that why this govt is in so hurry that these bills have to pass without any debate  and afraiding to face the questions from farmers.  secondly the word MSP is not being added in these bills. who will deal with contracting farming, means only specialist or big players in this industry want to control on whole farming sector as they know very well that this sector has wide scope to earn. please also advise that these bills should be openly debated in public and after finalise conclusion, these bill may be brought up."
