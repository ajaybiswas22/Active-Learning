"Biased news channel... Wrong depiction of Modi and laws as anti farmers. Laws were to avoid interference of middleman, who were taking advantage of high price, but farmers were unable to get proper prices."
Very well explained the government should leave optional to enter into a agreement this way farmer can choose his land he can fix the price
We r with farmers
MODI SHOULD WAKEUP AND TAKE STRICT ACTION. WHY PUBLIC AND MEDIA ALSO SLEEPING ON THIS ISSUE
"Yaswant Sinha said: The Prime Minister has stuck to his reputation of springing surprises. The announcement of the decision to repeal the three farm laws came as a huge surprise last morning, which, apart from being the pious day of Guru Parab, was also the birthday of Indira Gandhi. The comparison with Indira Gandhi is apt because she also withdrew the Emergency when she realised it had become untenable. Despite all his bravado, the Prime Minister came to the same conclusion, and because he is an 'election-jivi', and elections to five states including the all-important state of UP, are around the corner, and because defeat was staring him in the face, he was left with no option but to withdraw these black laws. In my tweet after the announcement I said, ""While I congratulate the Kisans on their victory over the government for the repeal of the farm laws, I attach no noble sentiment to the government for this move. It is a calculated step for the UP elections. For this government, democracy begins and ends with elections."" So this is it: nothing more than an election gimmick."
uneduacted farmers are a curse to a country
3) 3 farmer bill achhe hai
So sooooooooooo proud of our Farmers.
"Shameless people , they are not farmers at all."
Sudhirji during demonitization u support it and blamed the opposition. Economy destroyed and never regains. U just support the govt policy. Same thing happens in gst also. Small traders and industry destroyed. How can anyone believe that farmers law benefits the farmer only.
3 Laws should be improved instead of repeal. punjab aur UP ke addtiyon ko andolan ki jeet mubark ho.Tiket & Yudhvir gang misguided the innocent farmers who neber red 3 laws even...
I don't know how to express my gratitude. Always with them... The great warriors.. FARMERS. Remembering all the heroes who sacrificed themselves... More than 100 lost their life. These leaders may not see all those but the God will definitely punish the culprits.
"Your ""analysis"" (barely) is a perfect example of your biases. Out of the 7 minutes and 46 seconds, you have spent over 5 minutes talking about the troublemakers and how they should have followed rules, and less than 20 seconds on what the causality was. Sitting on a moral high horse and telling farmer leaders to maintain peace is easy, but if you have over a million followers listening to you, the least you can do is explain to them what could have caused this unrest and violence. Kya aapko sach mein ""Farak padta hai""?"
This is too much harrassment of farmers
I believe govt is responsible not solving the issue making them to wait from along time same time we should respect our law and order please do peaceful rally don't harm police or anything and I my humble request  to govt to resolve this  issue and talk to farmers and slove even there family members are waiting from a long time
Mandi system alone panjab government get 5000 crore.....profit......and lakhs of farmer suicide because of it....... farmers have right to do what he want with there producer.....
Yes sir you are supporting so much to farmers .keep it up.and government have no right to go against farmers . As they should see farmers wish and .agree what farmers say.
You are wrong. In Punjab in the past BJP never contest more than 20-22 seats. Absurd statements by Mr Abhijit.  Never BJP ruled Punjab. Priority is China preparation for attack India after Olympics. 15-02-2022 until 30.04.2022 will be war period. We lost Mr Arun Jaitley who was diplomat in local Agenda - Mukth Congress at Punjab - That is correct statement By Mr Abhijit
"Farming has high climatic risk... hence investment should be through farmer's partnership with government , non farming citizens and financial institutions...loss should be born by Government and Profit should be distributed among all"
other farmers of others parts of india are not having any problem with these farm laws  execept  punjab and haryana
"Contact farming exist and it is not viable for a farmer to fight legally, hence are exploited. "
Mere Dil m apki aur bhi respect ho gyi...yeh video viral hgi abthanx for supporting us bro...we all love uKisan Ekta Zindabadh
They were all khalistani no real farmers.. N sachi main farmer hote.. Abhi tak modi bye bye... Ho gaya hota.. 
Every poor farmer are with yogi and bill
During the bye polls BJP lost in the places where farmer's agitation was going on. To save western UP during state elections BJP has taken back the three farm laws. Time will tell whether this will be successful.
what is the demand of Farmers ? why government can't agree ?
Government or any farmer producer organisation or agricultural co-operative society may
"It is an election gimmick as 7 states are going for Assembly polls in 2022 namely Punjab, U.P, Uttarakhand, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur and Gujarat."
Modi govt should pay all damages because they never consult farmers before imposing law
"Abhay Dubey is right, RSS will trying to support BJP in UP election, that is why they jumped in Kisan Andolan again."
Childrens are  reluctant to take bitter pill but ultimately it cures them of disease.... similarly naive farmers seems to be misguided to take the pills of reform....looks they would continue to live in poverty and mercy of middle man 
"These are the farmers of our country whose demands the government was unable to fulfill and they decided to carry out peaceful protests from the very start, the group who hoisted that flag separated itself from the peaceful tractor rally, moving towards the red fort was led by deep siddhu, farmers claim that going to the red fort was not even in their plan"
"If the farmers themselves do not want any policies then why is the nemestic government so eager to issue those?? Please stay strong farmer brothers, we all will support you no matter how long it takes to get justice."
India national media is under central government
We did not brought law overnight but we never consulted with farmers about law because it wasn't necessary....
"Important reforms have been defeated twice: Land Acquisition and Farms reforms. No government will attempt these again for at least another two to three decades. Unfortunately, the farmers of non-agitating States also lost the benefit of the reforms because of the stupidity of Punjab farmers. "
Where can u see farmers pelting stones?????
"They wanted to make violence. Our farmers are sensible and responsible,but misled by anti national elements. Wishing for the farm law problem resolve soon."
Please let everyone know the reality   we support farmers
Hon'ble Ajit Anjum It's your true Journalism services rendered to the farmers and public. Welcome you.
NDTV Unbiased news channel...Other channels will call farmers anti-national... government should talk to them and try to address their problems.
"All chanting yogi and modi here should understand if these guys looked at common man lpg, petrol, food prices etc .. sirf chu*** bana rahein hain."
BJP is doing better than Congress and India needs it!
"so it,s duty of farmers to help the govt."
"Goosebumps at 0:51. Jo Bole So Nihal, Sat Sri Akal . Jai Hind. Bas mere pyare Sikh bhaiya naal yhi ardaas hai..kisi political party k behkawe me mat aana aur na hi violence karni h. Love from Haryana. Was a modi/bjp supporter earlier but this kisan movement opened my eyes."
U all people are not supporting to kisan. 
Reduced production of wheat and paddy is the only way to survive as a farmer..coz if production is less..demand is more..rates are high.. farmers should transfer from this to some non eatables products..
This protest is so wrong and now it proves that its all politics...They just want to ruin the very important day of the country and its so sad to see ...I just wanna ask that where these so called farmers minister are who said that they'll take the responsibility and will do a quite protest....I oppose this protest and tractor march..Jai hind 
We need a law that has a specific requirement to be a prime minister .  dont think  modi ji will qualify 
1) The farmers who r involved in the protest themself lack this knowledge.
Repeal the farm laws and stop catering to billionaire corporations.
"The above concept is quite interesting where the govt need to understand this demand  rather than keeping away themselves from the farmer , as they believe that they opened the channel for the meet between farmer and buyer.."
"People talk about kumbh , rallies , but not this corona  obviously support farmers"
"Official slogan of indian farmers ""Jo bole so nihal"""
"One truth was said by the cop (afsar) from a farmer's parivar.  Explains the village mentality that city cops have about women, young couples and night life in general."
If violence is the only way to get attention of the common people and international media then I am proud what farmers did was right and I would have done the same thing
