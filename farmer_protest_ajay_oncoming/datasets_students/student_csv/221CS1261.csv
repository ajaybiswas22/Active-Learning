Priya mam critacal l clear my all dout regarding this farmers issue Thank you 
"Khoom phirkar she came onher given agenda by present government. Hindu Muslim, Hussain etc."
There is NOTHING in the bill that will make things bad for farmers.
They forget that which food they eat   it made by farmer
I support Farmers.
Happy will be only congress and foreign funded left wing.Only thing worries is about poor uneducated farmers who works hard for there livelihood.In practically its impossible but Hope there's future Settles
This is win of Anarchy over democracy. Protesting farmers were not even 5% of total farmers.
"T - 6 months - going by bjp's latest hijacked lineage, a riot 6 months ahead of elections is expected. Usually it would be against ""transporting beef"" or keeping 200 gms of mutton in fridge or a hindu girl marrying a non hindu man etc. This time they got an easier enemy - the farmer. Its a little late this time, usually this would be done in September. Anyway i am happy that bjp didnt break its legacy and hige expectations of people like me. Welcome to the new world created by social media, fired by human's oldest virtue - gossiping and rumour mongering. Be it, somebody wearing mask or somebody eating beef or somebody marrying somebody - the mad crowd can easily generate an interest in that matter and that can be controlled by dubious politicians who appeared to have dedicated their entire life for ""bharat mata""!!!"
India or any other country did not have any stake in the formation process of such terrorist groups. Because India do not support state sponsored terrorism. 
Pehle bjp ne election ke liye rally kurwaye ab congress rally kurwva raha farmer bill cover mein ..our nation is not in good hands
Modi will become the President & pass on the mantle to either Amit Shah or Yogi ( tho he will be the second option )
Now time to accept the blunder of Sikh leaders in the time of Partition to join India..............but we still support you and want a peaceful  buffer zone (Khalistan)  between Pakistan and India to normalize the relations of both countries  ......love of Punjabi for other side
Whose incompetence is the inability to solve the problem of the farmers
whole world is watching farmers protest . Good work !! finally a new channel where we can see some real news updates
"Bakwas drama, all for just your survival. Go support farm laws if you want upliftment of farmers."
All the development of India during BJP govt is in social media only. Only numbers you can find everytime from explanation of govt.
"Next time when I hear the news about a farmer dying due to lower wages and income from those 3 states I won't be sad , as they chose their own fate ."
"Please read the articles 15 , 17 and 19 of farmer bill minutely. They are over riding the constitutional articles of similar numbers and it's a violation."
We are with farmers of punjab
Congress will be no more in India
"Yesterday was true diwali for Liberadu, Tukkade, congress, Muslim gang."
So what's the final solution for farmers. APMC dealers are exploiting them and as per your explanation corporatisation is also bad. Where should farmers go ?
all the Modi supporters are super happy with your video SG. I think it will be good if you get a very competent journalist like P sainath who has been reporting agrarian crisis for decades and you both have a live conversation in YouTube. It will bring both sides of the protest together rather than monologues on one aspect by either side
Lolz equal rights for everyone. INDIA is very very under Modi Todi govt
At the last bit rakesh tikait was savage 
I stand with farmer
"Farmers wins 4th time, 2 times under British rule"
"I am from the city in which this singhu broader is attached,Modi is an upper caste leader,most of the upper caste support this leader even if it means crushing the constitution values,he is most idiot leader,he holds a fake degree."
"Second point, the govt needs to understand that even china is shifting from service sector to manufacturing sector. We cannot be the phone factory of the world but we are definitely set up to be the food bowl pf the world, the govt needs to ensure and point her farmers towards goods that have international appeal . For example, bio fuel can be made from sunflowers,mustard etc but right now we dont have a mandi system for it. This will also relieve indians from petro prices etc. Second is palm oil,corn syrup..all western foods have it and india can definitely do wonders. "
"I am always   with u sir, I also think msp must be there with our farmers. "
"1) Contract farmers can make contracts with farmers without farmers having any legal protection to appeal. Farmers will have to abide by fine prints in legal contracts, which even educated people like us cant fight with big corporates."
It's loss for farmers only
I hope everyone understand the situation of the farmers and stop calling them anti-nationals it is not good for the country and other neighbouring countries can take advantage of that.
First of all yes Taliban is a terrorist background& there ideology is similarity of terrorist ideology & yes they are terrorist. India doesn't recognize Taliban is a Afghanistan government at least present time.
 farmers into super middleman and brokers for small farmers / Artiyas - a
Farmers should go to election
India mai shikho per zulm ho raha hai.... only one solution free khalistan.
"Clearly presented arguments from both sides. However, the last point that our government can (in fact regularly does) limit free market operations in agriculture by banning imports and exports at the expense of Indian farmers should not be held against this particular bill. The fact exists independent of this bill. We can only hope that the tendency will reduce gradually as it only hurts our agriculture industry."
I wish Indian media was stating facts like Vox instead of the being the hypocritic bought out companies they are.
"JAI JAWAN JAI KISAN!! On the bday of our father of nation & Lal Bahadur Shastri our second PM, who gave the above SLOGAN , this FASCIST BJP govt has manhandled the FARMERS. Any govt which lays its hands on the FARMERS  WILL NOT COME BACK  TO POWER!!!!!!"
"ZBNF farming is the way forward. Govt schemes  though well intentioned will be squandered by  systemic bureaucracy. Selling at MSP ,MIS is a result of  not adopting  marketing , value add  or  forecasting methods by the farmer."
"What's the big deal its just a flag, it could have been taken off by the police later.  It's not like farmer's damaged the Red fort building. Why is the government making an issue of a trivial issue. They're acting like these farmer's are an invading army..lol!!"
Very bad that farmers done in our country. Country first all other next
"Aur jo factor affect karte hain iske liye vo farmers ke control mein nhi hai. Kabhi rainfall zyada ho gye, moisture increase hogya , agar nhi hui to moisture decrease ho gya, kabhi grain size pura nhi hai, kabhi ye fertilizers ki matra kam reh jaati hai, kabhi kabhi produce ko rodent kharab kar dete hai, kabhi fungus lag gye."
Indians love and follow this intellectual. Would that Pakistan had such an intellectual. Love from Pakistan
"Can clearly tell the position of the BBC is not on the side of the farmers based on the questions the interviewer is told to ask, trying to make it seem like the farmers are the bad guys."
"Delhi police is waste under you CAA happened and now Farmer protest, what you guys are doing."
"Sir, I think you are taking these farm bills very positively. But do you think things work this way on the ground? Fact is if buyer is going to decide price even before farmer produces crop then MSP automatically becomes Max Selling Price! If your question is How ; then just think, corporates and politicians has better control over who can reach farmers and % deals among them will become more legal .. please dont look at only positive side of law, India need laws which are leak proof .. I hope I am making some sense. Please react to my opinion."
Support for farmers from Kashmir ....
We are all Indians support farmer 
7:18 That's true and thats the reason why farmers in bihar are in extremely poor condition.
Its kind of good decision. Now farmers will understand what they missed. Modi did it for them but if farmers  still  want to remain poor and on the mercy of middle man then god should save them.
So so happy for the farmers
"And BJP top leaders came to GHMC elections in Hyderabad, even farmers  are fighting in delhi they don't understand the problem of people they only want win and do nothing, so these is what happens if we believe in BJP"
"The new farm laws will not only affect the farmers but also us, the citizens who rely on the farm products directly or indirectly. Changes to uplift the agriculture and farmers lifestyle is definitely required. But it must also involve understanding their issues at the ground level and working on the solutions around it. A small inconvenience in our life to uplift our farmers lives is the least we could take."
Okay.. you didnt talked about the tool kit from greta.. and how rihana was paid.. the khalistan protest and khalistani terreroists.. and you didnt even mention the benefits of the law.. as how this will increase their standard of living.. the PM of INDIA has already said that.. the farmers who want these laws to be followed can follow them and those who dont want they can not.. its not forcing all the farmers to follow it .. its compulsory ...
