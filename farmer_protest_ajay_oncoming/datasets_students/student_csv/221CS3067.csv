"When BJP is riling they have done anything wrong it's correct let it be women, children, farmers but when non BJP do its wrong"
"The explanation is so unbiased that those who are pro-government, belive the bill is good for farmers and those who are anti understand why the bill is bad for farmers. It also says that the bill has it share of both good and bad, and a proper discussion would make it lot better for every party involved."
Greetings to all our valuable farmers*
"Tikait has got political ambitions. The other side, so called kisans, are also crossing limits. How to control them...Could they be be allowed to do anything under garb of some Andolan."
One year of protest on the roads during a COVID pandemic and THEN the worlds biggest democracy chooses to repeal the 3 farm bills 
"Our farmers are facing inconvenience sitting on roads for last few months in such cold , rain with their kids  and people who are eating at their homes still criticising them, shame on such rubbish people"
These 3 laws are for betterment of farmers & some political parties and groups taking advantage of this protest.
Bakts :- Farmers are anti-national while eating dinner and wating BND 
"As per the Agriculture Census of 2015-2016, 86% of farmers are small and marginal (less than 2 hectares). How much bargaining power will they have in a free market? How will they go and find a market for their produce? Also how will they decide what is the correct price and that they are not being cheated? Are these small and marginal farmers going to receive any training? The concern the farmers have is how will they be connected to the free market. Although they have the option of APMC. But wouldn't the big corporates use their powers to ultimately make the APMCs unsustainable in the long run? That would make MSP redundant. All these are valid concerns that should be taken into account. How can a law be passed without consulting the stakeholders/beneficiaries for whom it is being made? The RSS affiliates like Swadeshi Jagran Manch and Bharatiya Kisan Sangh are also opposing it. Are they also being manipulated by the opposition parties? Shekhar Gupta ji, you have not analyzed the issue properly. Sorry, did not expect this from a senior journalist like yourself."
Samdish bro thanks alot plzz make more videos love you  and big respect for you also kisaan Majdoor ekta zindabad 
"This bill is not about farmer but hits the middleman, who are the leaches in our system and have a very powerful lobby and opposition party supports."
4. Why can't we promote better FPO/FPC to empower farmer to make better deals rather than always saying that a farmer can't negotiate ???
"Secondly, there is no tax on farmer, rather buyers pay the tax"
Taliban has also captured hero splendor plus..gifted by India..
I wish you had done a bit of research with the farmers on ground level instead of stating these statistics in order to justify these black laws. The farmers grow wheat and paddy because of sure shot income guarantee and yet they are pressed in debt and farmers suicides are rising day by day. If they take away the procurement system that guarantee will end. The idea of this law seems wonderful on paper but each and every farmer in punjab has had worse experiences selling to private players and contract farming eg. Pepsico buying potatoes. This is the main reason for the wheat paddy cycle continuation. 
"you have to subsidize farmers somehow. usa do it, japan do it, eu do it, china do it. orelse the whole society will suffer."
"Hindu Rashtrawad, Sanatan Dharma , Khalistan and government support are things."
"Police must join with farmers, your brothers."
Good recapitulation of the fact. It is the biggest movement againat the elected Govt.The sacrifice of the lives will give the befitting reply to the BJP government and the dalal media.
Thanks to BBC from Bottom of Heart. This will energies Farmers against dreadfull Laws .( Ex Pharmacy Officer Moga Pb  Bharat)
"I am sure none of the farmers except a few know as to why they are agitating, APMC s are controlled by politicians, this is the reason why Punjab government is supporting the agitation. And gullible farmers are being manipulated by politicians who are blackmailing the central government. How sad."
These are just positive PR & Marketing strategies by Modi because of upcoming elections
"Every govt organization that was supposed to help people had become a mafiadom, not only APMC. If it is so easy to make APMC work in an orderly manner then why in 55 years has it only been degrading through multiple govts? I have seen how the farmers suffer because of this. If anybody dares to take his/her produce directly to the market he/she is quickly brought under control through threats."
Mohak silently said that Farm bills are good but the problem is only of trust.
"This government of course has a brute majority in parliament.  But on the whole quiet a lot of people genuinely think, many of the top governmental functionaries lack the much needed sophistication and grace. The people are also a lot frustrated with constitutional organs like the judiciary who are often perceived as siding with the ruling party rightly or wrongly.  What the government should understand is that the negative politics being bombarded on the Indian polity by the BJP today has a limit and there should be proper governance transcending the mediums of caste and creed. The rulers in a democracy must be humble and going roughshod over farmers who feed the country is not good politics."
A government aginst our own farmers..indian Hitler modiraj murdhabad corporate Bandhu Modi murdhabad black law's should be removed immediately
"To give an update on this protest, the government unconditionally repealed all the three new laws. The farmers have declared victory."
"That person killed to farmers , don't think any way to let him of farmers killer .  On the spot shoot them . We all indian peoples  stand with farmers . Farmers our lives without farmers we can't go any step . Without food we can't working for 1 hour . All should to respective them of farmers .  Farmers life is valuable than BJP antisocial Criminal ."
"Not done for the love of farmer, but rather with UP elections in mind. Sad so many farmers had to pay with their lives."
Hope they reinstate the farm laws in a phase wise manner post state elections
Traders when have to buy will buy from plaes where its available at cheaper prices be ti from other  countries and our farmers will suffer when traders dont buy from them . Think of the chines products that have infested indian stores in all sextors bcause of the congress free trade policy by great MMS when he was the FM in 1991. 
Why India is not showing their intentions to fight the terrorist...
"Hats off to the farmers braving bitter cold weather, Modi's bigotry and Indian media "
Congratulations  Farmers
"Its nice to see what my fellow Indians think. Unfortunately it doesnt matter. Modi does not care. Its Farmers today, will be Citizens tomorrow. Its just a matter of time."
international price of the goods. After 2010 the minimum support price 
Godi media is not welcome there..
One bill was coming for farmer now it will not come because of this andolon
5 farmers died along with journalistic values.
BJP leaders arrange Rural areas campaign for creating awareness in detail with farmers. Local language needed for such farm acts which farmers can understand
"Govt should impose a line in bill that whether FCI, APMC or pvt companies... Anyone who is buying crop from farmers is can't buy at a price lower than MSP."
Please support indian farmers...protest still going on...foriegn media help us..modi government is crushing us please help...
Rakesh tikait...you are gradually earning my respect!
Well done by farmers ..they know the laws better than any one relating to thier field...
These are not terrorists these are farmers trying to save the agriculture sector from the hands of capitalist monopoly. But govt funded media channels trying to defame them as khalistani terrorists or funded by opposition political party just because they wear turbans and have flag of their religion sikhism.
up me aab yahi hoga corona corona essi me hi bolne ka himmt h election ke rally me toh bol nhi paogi

The middlemen - Imagine a scenarion where a poor farmer goes to a mandi along with his produce to get the returns for his hardwork. He bares the transportation cost as well. But the middlemen grades his produce as low quality and defective..and buys it at a negligible cost. The return that the farmer got was lesser than the amount he invested to grow the produce and the transportation charges. What are the chances of this actually happening to farmers of this country?
Some farmers ka nahi balki India whole farmers ka revolution tha modi ji
"I believe Ground work all set by farmers and farm leaders, rural vote slipping from BJP big trouble for BJP,  not working anything for BJP big issues like unemployed, inflation will cost BJP badly, BJP leaders are not able to enter villages, they are facing protest and are insulted by the villagers, a lots of video are in circulation in Social media."
These opportunities for ambanis & adanis not for farmers because we know about our pm's promises
Good Analysis Dr. I think soon our great Farmers will have to lead our country. Atleast no one will have to die out in hunger! Farmers our Life Provider!
The scarecrow has made friends with crows and is now scaring the farmers 
"the bill seems to be very beneficial for farmers, what basis are they protesting them about. how would the farmers lose, there is so much opportunity around this for building a farmer society and many employment opportunity will also raise in this regard."
"I am not getting why some ppl still defending the protesters. Instead defending, they should take over those violent ppl to police as soon as possible. It will help in investigation and the soft feelings for protesters(actual farmers only) will be alive. Jai Hind."
