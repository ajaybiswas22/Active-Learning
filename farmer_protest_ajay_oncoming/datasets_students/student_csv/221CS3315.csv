Why don't you show video before violence where farmers were crushed by car bias media dalal media
More power to these farmers. I hope their voices are heard (actually listened to and acted upon) and that they stay safe and well.
"this protest would come to an end, If farmers could see this video instead of news."
P. M. Modiji crying for small farmer....
"It's really amazing, if 50000 Taliban can defeat US Europe India and their allies. It means in future Pakistan can hunt down India easily."
"they are not farmers, they are the chamcha's of Congress"
Totally concocted stories from everywhere. Absolute disregard for the farmers. Politics only. The opposition has no clue on how to oppose a popular govt. 
Now a days farmers condition is improving  Due to Modi ji they are getting direct benefits.Middle men like Tiket are worried.This is politically motivated and funded movement.
Modi ji saara drama next election ka h. Likn hm kuch nhi bhoolne wale a.we are farmers. We remember what you did in past with farmers
"4)The bills ensure that the farmer can enter into contract with a party and will gets  agreed price for his crops, so that farmers could survive beyond govt support by farming  commercially lucrative crops."
"To some extent the procurement policy of FCI is responsible for lower prices of grains in open market...if they could ensure smooth procurement and timely payment of dues to the farmers, the market price could have remained marginally above the MSP. FCI could then sell the excess grain in open market after booking some profit. Besides this, more categories of MSP for a grain is needed in consonance with the variety of the produce. FCI may also think of value addition and may itself become a supplier to the corporate. FCI solely for the purpose of PDS is a very bad idea."
Shame to all for supporting ruckus .. public nuisance.. a true farmer can never afford to leave his field and play political games...
The government should not yield to such arm twisting tactics by this MINISCULE MINORITY of the Indian population. Farmers are over-pampered with various concessions and subsidies. Giving back very little to the consumers.
"Up Election could have started before 1 year back, maximum farmers must alive"
Because we have example of ITC which procures directly from farmers
Happy Independence DAY to INDIAN Brothers from  Brotherly Pakistan and AFGHANISTAN

I really really enjoy following your analysis. Currently one my favourite resources. Can you please explain/link farmer suicides to your analysis and history of agri reforms in India?
"Now this matter has gone out of the country , canadian pm Trudeau is also supporting the farmers shame on the govt for spoiling our country's name "
1000% agreed abt mrp for farmers 
"In my view there should be a law on msp, To give  some protection to farmers also."
Beating farmer with stick What are you called security
"1. If procurement has to be tinkered with, there HAS to be an alternative for the farmer. You cannot leave ALL THE FARMERS of Pb & Hry out in the cold."
You could also have given an assumption as to why the govt. fails to acknowledge the demands of the farmers.
"I donno which channel is saying the truth, there are channels which show the good side of farm bill then there's a channel which shows loopholes in farm bill.... Hopefully this riots get fixed"
"I think we need to see from goverment perspective too, like why they are making this law which obviously spark the farmer protest"
"So basically you are worried about Monopoly in this sector, well we already have laws for that. If a corporation starts exploiting of the farmers or consumers then both will shift to another company. Market competition needs to be maintained and that is where govt steps in. Ask yourself, why is internet in India so cheap?? It's because of market competition, and buddy it works wonders."
"Its high time that Govt.,; Modiji should see that the Farmers request is fulfilled.... afterall the law you say is in favour of Farers & if Farmers who are the real beneficiary is unhappy why you want to force it on them. At least today I wish your Sri Ram gives you the wisdom to think wisely & repeal those 3 unwanted Farm Laws.The whole World is watching us"
My full support to farmer for there legal rights
After this don't expect any kind of development for farmers. 
8. All want farm reforms. Punjab and Haryana farmers unions want to repeal
You have done a great job of providing a true image of this movement by bringing history of farmers and highlighting the government's authoritarian agenda overall...
"These laws enormously BENEFITTED the small and marginal farmers, but NOT the middlemen."
Up and Punjab election is coming hahaha dont fool Indian and farmers
Assertion: bjp is fearing to lose UP and Punjab elections
Real problem of msp of crop real farmer's are facing problem
I think it's a good law for the farmers but government should also ensure that APMC Markets will be continue In such a way as they are running now
Proud of every farmer and every voice that speaks for it
I salute to brave heart farmers to stand against such dictator government. Very very egoistic Prime Minister india have right now. I hope people will understand and bring back the democracy
This kind of farmers are the curse for the country and defaming real farmers
"Now go and convince the BJP's against in the election and tell the public that remove BJP, save the country, save democracy.i salute to all farmers"
States had different rules & regulations 2buy food grains frm farmers. It was difficult 4corporates 2handle so many states with so many different regulations & taxes
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SUPPORT TO FARMERS. GOD BLESS YOU ALL.  BEST WISHES FOR YOUR FUTURE .
Punjab ka nam jada highlight mat kro..we know iske piche Govt or media ki intentions sahi nahi h.
Is be devoted to Modi and see India become a Dictatorship Soon very soon....
Farmers will win
Grain in Punjab Haryana MSP RS 1950 why its Rs 950 in Madhya 
"SG Sir, Your commentary on seven C of democracy was missing in the episode where you had analyzed and supported these farm laws. You think opposition would have agreed? I disagree. I still feel PM tried and failed to convince or say ""manage"" the situation was better than not trying but to convince opposition. I'm sure govt. think tank would have discussed this. It's better to try and fail than to take a defeatist approach."
"You should have covered the topic of how Haryana police treated farmers when their approach was peaceful ,they just wanted to protest in delhi just like other dharnas in jantar mantar."
Shame on bjp government.. I love kishan
A big thanks to Rajat Sain and Roohani  this reel will glorify the Flowers of our India  and all other countries Punjabis and kissans
Stand with farmers of India
"PM Modiji is a survivor, not your rigid, inflexible idealist."
"Being a farmer myself, I DO NOT support the government on this bill. I have sold my wheat produce on MSP, as well as to private players. The claim by the government that a farmer prior to this bill could not sell to a private player is a total LIE. In fact ,I always had an option to bargain better with a private purchaser due to MSP. This will gradually push me to look at other crops than wheat and rice. If all farmers slowly start shifting from the staple crops, then price are bound to increase."
