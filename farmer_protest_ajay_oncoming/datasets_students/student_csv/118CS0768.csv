"After 9-10 months of the protest being started, I listened to several people on internet and this is by far the most amazing explaination to Farm bills I ever listened/watched. Also I came across this channel a week ago and I must admit the content here is superb. More power to you!"
If govt really want farmer to grow and not suicide then govt should pass and apply MSP law across India.
It's good that the farmers are protesting. The  govt. cannot have its own way all the time.
Farmer is like an another solder of India who is feeding us. Police is throwing stone on them. Its not fair
"Who will buy American Apples for $5 if Indian Apples are available for $2 ? To prevent this from happening and Losing Monopoly, Foreign Nations are fuding these Fraudulent Protests to keep India backward and India's Agricultural sector stalled. This is why you see Global support from Rihanna, Greta, All Backed by International elements etc. Without knowing this, Some people foolishly support these Protests."
The same as in Europe ... NO FARMERS = NO FOOD
It just teaches one thing that never waive  small farmers loan even if they do suicide because they are the one who supported politically backed famers
Most of the farmers in all other states did not have a problem. 
Lots of love Dhruv bhaiyya for supporting India farmers
Relief. That means it was wrong. What about Khalistanis which media like yours leveled
Haryana farmers must protest against this Modi Government.. TAMILNADU will always support honest Haryana farmers to uphold truth and justice. At the same time Haryana farmers must take care of themselves against covid pandemic.
KYA AB FARMERS TALVAAR NAI MAAR SAKTA ??  UPLOAD A VIDEO OF YOU EXPLAINING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON RDAY 2021 IF YOU HAVE THE GUTS
Save farmers please show latest news of farmers   #SikhGenocide  is happening   bjp goons are killing farmers save farmers save future
"Shekhar Gupta casually compares Alaudin Khilji's price control to MSP, while at the same breath explaining how it was the maximum price set for soldiers (not minimum). This approach lacks intellectual rigour.  You can draw baseless comparisons of every economic and social policy with some practice that occurred centuries ago.  Most of Indian laws, policies and acts are based on something or the other introduced by the British. This does not necessarily undermine the contemporary relevance of any law or Act nor does it make it particularly special. What Shekhar Gupta should question is why is the Centre adamant on implementing these Acts even when the states have shown that they can easily reform it to suit their own situation (which he seems to be using as his primary argument)."
There are many more farmers in India then  these protesters who support to the law
"WHY congress, TMC, samajwadi party is against BJP!!! and all this incidents are happeneing before election? Think for yourself!!!!"
"Police started blocking routes, firing tear gas and lathi charge? 2 months the farmers have been ignored, time is up Modi! We are not afraid."
Sir In my perspective there should be a group of persons from farmers side and a group of police officer who can coordinate themselves and take one particular group ahead ...
Finally after 1000s of farmers sacrificed their life to come to this day .
"India needs strong, decisive leadership. Modi is like a 16 year old kid on Instagram, who gets restless if people do not like or admire him. We need serious leadership."
I stand with farmer 
"Bahut bura hua, citizens will At lost. Very big loss to agriculture sector and small farmers."
Its a test of time for these 3 bills whether it will wrong the opposition or it will turn out to be another type of demonetisation. I really wish these reforms overcome all myths and help farmers.
If APMC has 500 square kilometre area then why govt. provide new mandies to reduce this covering area.
from seller and buyer each 8.5% . These new 2020 farm laws allows farmers to sell 
"The issue is not just related to MSP. It is something deeply rooted in what economists have been debating for more than 2 decades. Most of the Indian farmers own 2 acres or less agricultural land. There is no way you can improve the standard of living for these farmers if they work on farm alone. The MSP system coupled with the food subsidies help these farmers just survive nothing more. Economists want Indian government to push these low acreage farmers out of farms and work into manufacturing and services sectors be it as a labourer in the upcoming factories being moved from China. It hard to say who is being adamant here, these farmers with a very low farm holding who will never be able to improve their standard of living with farming or the government that thinks moving them out of the farm will somehow accelerate the pace of manufacturing in India. This is a problem where no one is wrong eventually and no one is right."
I am belonging to haryana. I know the situation of farmers in my village.
Who will take the responsibility & accountability  of 600+ Deaths Farmers
"Shame on Zee TV. Few days back, you were showing that the broders are empty now. To defame the leaders, you are showing now that farmers are on roads in rains etc. Where were you earlier?"
"Interesting days, looks like BJP wants to secure UP and help Capt gain Punjab."
Most simplest and unbiased explanation about the farm bills.
Aj jo innocent farmers hai unka Jo agenda tha...bht Jada dilute krdia gya....local political leaders and other hooligans destroying their motive and converting it to their motive.... Sad that we saw such an incident on 26th January.
Farmers will always remain poor and Middle Man will be in Profit.
I urge to all farmers be united.
"Why non farming population should worry? New laws will create massive unemployment and internal security problems. Above all corporations will become too big and too significant for any future Govt to do course correction not only in farming but in consumer market as well since these corporations will have end to end monopoly. In future Govt's primary function would be to put out fires with army and paramilitary forces because neighboring countries will create internal security problems by exploiting frustrated and ignored sections of society. Foreign Investment will not only cease but run out in such environment except aggressive exploiters like Vedanta, Adani, United Fruits etc. There will be two types of Indians, one living comfortably in tight security zones and one living miserably trying to save their skin from these 'Zaildars"" of 'East India Company' group."
What about 3 billon dollors spent by indian govt in afganistan
"You are killing farmers in Delhi and and other places indiscriminately,  there is no problems on that,  right????"
Opposition wants to destroy our farmers . Media should play a positive role in explaining correct position . Otherwise these anti nationals /opposition parties would destroy India .I  my India.
Taliban is just Apni Gulli ka Sher.. and why would India intervene..?? this threats mean nothing. They will never dare to come to Indian Borders...

"Well Mr. Shekhar, you conveniently missed out the legal implications to farmers incase these corporates takes loans against the farm lands and what happens if the corporates don't pay the amount as promised or reduce the rates."
70yrs of congress rule Abjit you want Modiji to correct within 7yrs...who is he a magician.
"Zee news and Aaj Tak media showing only other part and asking ""kya ye Kisan h""....yeah those are farmers only that tolerating all your political drama.."
Support farmers.. No farmers No food
Poor farmers are helpless. Even the govt is helpless before the broker mafias. There will be an end to all mafias.
"It is a win of ignorance, lack of drive to understand the bill, and lack of empathy for other farmers. But anyway democracy is a popularity contest."
"Bill wapis lo then all will be ok . Kisaan will happy. Its all about govt ego and Modi dictatorship . You guys are helping his Dictatorship policy. All normal people will have to pay for that INDIA is going to be China. If we didnt stop , Country is going in some rich powerful hands ."

"Thanks For This Video, Make Me Proud As a son Of Farmer "
"US doing two face work , at the same time they are helping pakistan to help taliban and on the other side they are helping afghan forces . its so confusing? When this will end . if u cant bring peace in my country than dont help our enemies too . so our own force can bring peace."
"Even I support farmers I belong to farmers family,but whole world is polarised and everyone shows what suits thr ideology. Truth is now just a version of individual."
There is no question on the need for laws to get rid of unscrupulous middlemen between farmers and consumers. How does taking away Mandis going to help? Mandis were set up to prevent exploitation of farmers in the first place! How come it become breeding ground for middle man??
