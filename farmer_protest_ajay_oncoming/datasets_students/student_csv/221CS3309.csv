Thank you for this breakdown! Here in my country the USDA is going to start taxing livestock farms for their methane. (Literally a tax on animal flatulence) I feel like the governments around the globe are messing with the food supply
And why only Punjabi farmers from whole lot of Indian farmers protesting??
Love for farmers from Kerala
Rakesh Tiket is dramebaaz. He should be arrested& put in jail  for life imprisonment
"*He had to, there was no other way left for tyrant to defend his torture on farmers* !"
Congrats to farmers and sikh brothers from kashmir 
#standwithfarmers
"Priyanka should conduct Radhyatra through out U.P demanding Justice for All victims of Yogi Government (farmers killed, Safia (Rabia) brutal rape and murders , Hathras victims, killing of innocent people by Sangis etc)."
Discussion  between  Govt and the farmers is the only  way.... Vandalism  is no way... Discuss  and understanding  of the bill and regarding  MSP already  it is there.. So more amount  of freedom  has been given to the farmers against  the middlemen who are actually  looting  the hard work of the farmers ...Discussion  and proper understanding  between  the farmers  and the Govt is the way out for better  tomorrow  for the farmers...
"You should discuss, is farmer producing what is required in the country? If you produce more than required, price is going to be lower. Currently we are producing Wheat, Rice, Vegetables more than Dal, Fruits, Dry fruits etc. We need to reduce the former and increase the later."
Now people  who are agitating must stop them. Status quo will continue for farmers.
We r with the farmers.They r right.We welcome them to delhi.Govt should agree  to their demands.
As a Punjabi-Sikh I cried watching this wholesome coverage by Samdish. Thank you SchoopWhoop for this <3 can't thank you enough.. farmers need these types of platforms to express their views  Love from Punjab.
Please make a video with aerial view stretching from the beginning to the end of each highway farmers have blocked. These aerial views are how we can estimate how many ppl are there in total.
"Well, i see this as a message to all people who feel opprssed by this fascist regime. Say thanks yo farmers, get inspired from them as say hoorah to Gandhian methods of struggle. "
"Arnab please question the preposterous judgement of our modi ji. How can he do this! These farmers are terrorist, he is negotiating with terrorist. He should must encourage encounters of these people.! Arnab please Arbab, please do this!"
My dear meghnad only 6% farmers in nation get benefits of msp. All others get lesser price than msp. I always support your initiative in news media but you have less info on farming just like any other city guy...
Punjab farmers are anxious for losing Easy money they have got so used to on the back of unsustainable farming practices supported by populist govt policies...
The Laws were meant to benefit the farmers by destroying the power of wholesale mafia. But the benefits have not been understood by the farmers.
Govt. Should strengthen APMCs so that every farmer get the benefit. Otherwise it will remain as a political gimmick.
India Today how low will you stoop to save BJP.
Well done karan.. ! Really appreciated for supporting farmers..!
Your statement at 1.03 that farmers can sell his produce only at APMC in his area is wrong.
"I hope India knows the world is watching the way its treating its farmers, its minorities and its people they wont get away with the same things theyve gotten away with in the past so shes 1984. This time the world is watching them so the government needs to wake up and start treating its people with the respect and dignity they deserve."
No vote for bjp in up uk punjab and goa
They are not a farmer
bjp will do time pass with RRB NTPC candidates and  farmers like before.. 2022 is going to be a year of protests
tbh my family is farming based family we dont find anything wrong in this bill kyuki we farmers from UP only sells sugarcane as we sell it directly to factory!!! 
farmer are right in our profit
"4. As you discussed, farmer can sell there goods anywhere,  so why this reform if already govt have eNAM scheme."
I'm a Hindu. I read geeta and also Gurugranth everyday. How can a Sikh wearing kara commit such a horrific murder . Getting bad name to Guru Sahib. I feel i love and follow the teachings of Sikh gurus more than you people. Don't bring down the image of waheguru jis khalsa. You people have to be saviors of the world and not narrow minded Terrorist. Don't think your shastr can be used for protecting dharma in present day world. You people got stuck in time and roam around with outdated weapons. Do some good karmas Singhs with your holly hands. I love and respect all the Sikh gurus for their teachings and sacrifices made to protect Dharma.
What are the issue in the farm bill can anyone help me???
"Only modiji,Jay hind "
"Mr. Rathee , can you explain why those bills were not in favour of all the indian farmers not a particular segment of society.  Opposing a party is not bad but opposing the decision which could bring prosperity to farmers is irony."
This is see whole Indian former's support us 
b)  Required money and material input should be provided to farmer if desired by farmer. 
Vox covered more news about the farmer protests than Indian media itself.
Is media trying to support farmers ....rather then highligting on violence which is wrong
 He is a traitor... Rakesh Tikait..now give solutions to farmers. Stop putting burden on tax payers shoulders. That is what Rakesh Tikait are doing. Dirty politics... Rakesh Tikait should be in jail
"What will change for farmers , nothing .  Farmers can enjoy gulami of mediators."
BJP is moving day by day on naazi's footprint and impress with his ideology....  sham on modi backing this ideology
"People who hardly know anything about India, including the farm laws are raising their voices as if its gonna change anything. "
Rahul gandhi should read the new farm bill first.
"If these laws are passed, it will benefit the farmers in the poorer states."
India Mai 29 states hai andolan sirf Congress bale state Mai hi ho Raha hai
Please stop blaming Pakistan because Pakistan paid a big price for the fight of America but enough is enough we don't want to be a play grounds for American
"This is inhumane,cruel and insane  act on farmers...,Rest those souls in peace...,.Yes,but the real question is will the culprit be punished for murders..."
"Now all the andha bhakt got official position "" sarkari Taliban"""
"_Even after organiszing crowded mass political rallies he lost in Bengal elections, he don't want the same fate in coming Punjab & UP elections_"
It was NOT violence - it was MIRDER by BJp who ran their vehicles from the back while farmers were leaving the protest PEACEFULLY
"ITC makes partnership with the farmers in the same way, and the farmers are too happy, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, UP are the areas ITC is focusing, but those in the Singhu border are making fake issues, what do they get from this"
Here Government want to make a law for Farmer which was rejected by the farmer.
u did not discuss with farmer.farmer dnt want so take it back .why too much talking..
"Is the objectionable three farm laws brought by Modi government worth their merit, with the continuing opposition by the Indian farmers? And the happenings?"
They aren't farmers
