Best video for those who really want to understand farmers protest
If union government can not take agricultural reforms....then why Agriculture is in Concurrent list....plz transfer Agricultural into state list....let state manage there farmers according to there need
These people are not farmer. Our farmer are working in field. This is politics.
3:15 - No-one should loose their rights - She nailed it... I support my lovely farmers.
"Let consider reliance (remember jio bulldozer marketing tactics) company buy all future rice bags at a fair price from farmers in India  ,  which is not yet to seeded. Which create artificial scarcity in future using it he keep higher prices than MSP which led to chaos in buyer and where let to a shortage in government state-run reaction stores poor people can't eat their meals."
Mr modiji shd take the guidelines of Mr Devendra Sharma  n help farmers who are pillars
Both farmers and police suffering due to modi govt
"After losing by the farmers' movement, the Prime Minister withdrew the agricultural rules but the news reporter is all Modi-loyal so he cannot tell the truth."
Finally farmers won 
"Leaving behind Jinaa Mughal  matter behind bjp must think to provide jobs to Youths, resolve farmers issues, must maintain peace and harmony amongst the communities. Jai Hind Jai Bharat."
Aaj Tak Godi Modia ki one of the Biggest shameless and useless channels. Their Anchors are absulately fully promoting Godi Modia's and Government agenda. Gandhi naali ka Keeda channel 
"Hence, Govt must ensure that Private Sector as well as APMC can't purchase corp from farmers below MSP. Made a healthy auction. Set a base price for a corp (that is MSP), then who have the power they will buy from farmers. Thus it will create a open competitive market for buyers and also a fair mechanism for poor farmers. "
India should talk with tablian immediate effect
My opinion  is that we need to consolidate the national agenda. Enormously military capabilities are being developed by china. Even the Americans have been pushed to the 2nd position with respect to the quad defense capabilities. China is also the richest nation now. Punjab is too  precious to let farm laws divide it. Let us consolidate to face the Chinese might. Let us move forward.
farmer's protest have failed due to violence
We proud on Haryana Punjab Brothers
"Nonviolent agitation is all good. It might not affect the general Modi support. But SG points correctly, in no way, the protest for/of Farmers against the laws should take shape of an agitation for Identity  among the Sikhs of Punjab."
"Shame on BJP. LONG LIVE THE FARMERS WHO FEED THE MILLIONS. 56"" chest and 3"" in the pants."
Guys support farmers they are our back bone 
Congress in Punjab. Farmers of Punjab. What?
"Any legislation to be introduced in Parliament after consultation with the stake-holders. In this case, farmers were not consulted and didnot take farmers into confidence. Any concern(s) from stake-holders must be taken into consultation before drafting the legislation, which was not done in this case, which is wrong in democracy. This is not a radical reform but a high handedness of Modi Govt."
Thanks to Modi ji for bringing agricultural

Allow other parts of country to test this farm bill which has nothing to lose at this point.
"It's very sad about the farmers plight, but PM is adamant seems he does not listen to any one, does what he does best, only diverts issues all the time."
Can you translate it into hindi so that we can share it with actual farmers?
We stand in side  of farmers
"Happy for the farmers! Democracy won yesterday, Freedom will have to wait for tomorrow!"
The supposed beneficiaries of the bill are fighting it tooth and nail. And the government insist on forcing a bill on farmers which they won't accept at any cost. This government is enemy No.1 of the poor and middle class and farmers of India.
29:00 at this point they showed how loving and caring they are. It is giving me tears that they are facing so much no main stream media is showing this proud of you unscripted. First i was not supporting this protest because of tv news but now these videos has open my eyes and now i feel sorry for not supporting them earlier.
"Mr. Imran Khan is honest man, he truly deserves to be prime minister of Pakistan.  He is right about Taliban."

Aarbaz Chutia 1st Ambani Gehu Nahi bez tha hai thik. 2nd Contact Farming is some how the best for Farmers. MPS Is Perfect. 
Supporting farmers is common sense (Not common in politicians) All developed countries pay fat farmer subsidies and high support prices to keep farmers growing grains. Support to farmers from the USA.
"Congratulations to my Farmers brothers,"
Mam please brief me that advantage and disadvantaged of farmers bill ?? Plss
Pakistan is gloating. It is gloating over what it sees as the defeat of the U. S. and India as well. Pakistan needs to remember that Afghanistan is only a skirmish. The real fight with Pakistan will be on the global stage.
So in fake congress farmers protest someone was crushed
"And today 19th of November 2021, the Central Government of India repeals all three anti-farmer Farm Laws! Huge day for India!"
This all political drama by Congress party and farmers
The demands of the farmers are very reasonable. The government should accede to their demands without further delay.
Ppl protesting here non r farmers...
Farmers stand your ground . Do not allow the corporations to take over.
"Ans: killing farmers who are protesting, declaring them anti-nationals , treating the farmers even worse than terrorists. "
"Yes mr modi you are right, this law's is biggest key of bjp party corporate fund."
"if this would have been done by a bollywood star,or a muslim... imagine what headlines and strict actions and godi media tamashash would have been made."
Real fact :New farm Bill make Farmers daily labours and migrants in coming days. Salute to the farmers who braved the winters & cruelty of government.
"By the way, Some of the farmers for some money from various political parties have taken the gold away from many farmers of India. Sad to see"

"Big cry day for Andhbhakt, modiji accepted demands of khalistani Deshdrohis "
