These are goons disguised as farmers.
I came after PM announced repeal if farm laws. You predicted correctly. I appreciate you shekar ji.
Do u know al economist and expert supported farm law.
"We are not in the regim of cowards Congress, we are in leadership of Hon modiji and can stand strongly and bring anyone in its knees."
Grt video and grt enthusiasm in farmers as well as samdish . I hope they make this arogant govt. take back these laws!
I'm from Pakistan... And surprised India still have such people.. Very non bised analysis.
"Thanks for supporting Farmers, You say everything true,,Shame on media,,From now media is not free press it's bounded."
2- if it is to protect Farmer why no MSP?
"court, police, power is to dominate hindu, but for rakesh tikait everything is possible in Riad"
Police Vs farmers.      Both are backbone of our country but main villain is Modi sarkar who giving orders to police and watching this
I feel very sorry today for our farmer brothers and sisters.
I won't argue any further. Will just say only one thing. For once lets accept that these laws aren't friendly for the people of Punjab. Farmers there just don't want private players to enter in Punjab. Then there IS AN EASIER WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS.
I don't get it I have read all the clause of the bill it helps the farmer but why all this protest ?? Plz help me to understand by not calling me a bhakt  iam a neutral person 
We support farmers.
Even government fire to the Kisan they don't afraid because we're Punjabi tell  to modi
Correction Modi ji wo kisan nhi the yeh pure desh even Pappu ko v malum hai
Sir you are disgracing farmers agitation by calling it political. What is the use of MSP if procurement is not gurrenteed?
I stand with the farmers.
Pressuring the government to make a statement that can cost lives of hundreds of our soldiers is un ethical for the media. Best option for India here would be to wait and watch for as the things unfold
Jai jawan Jai kisaan. Totally biased achor. That's called BJP media.
"BBC should focus on the core(main ,good)  decision taken in rally about the farm law by farmer."
"how does one distinguish these farmers being genuinely mistreated, or just another special interest group barring other potential competitors?"
Wow! Our BJP government pass 15 Bills in 2 days and all the opposition was absent  and it is totally undemocratic 
"m a farmer i don't mind change but there is no effort to provide awareness why change is necessary how it'll effect in good or bad , how we prepare ourselves to take most advantage from these changes."
"Feels like farmers are not yet ready to make farming like an industry. If I get good price elsewhere why I may not like to sell there? Well it is related to quality of product. If quality is bit bad, I can sell in mandi, MSP is already there as was before, if good I may sell elsewhere in high price. Protest is highly motivated by politics and middlemen."
"Some parts of laws are problematic. It doesn't allow the farmer to go to court if they feel they are wronged by the dealers. The highest official for that is SDM. That is creating fear in farmers. Why govt. had to add this extra bit in the laws? If tomorrow you are wronged by someone and not allowed to go to court by some new law, would you not oppose it? Would like to know SG's view on this."
"jab congress same bill laye toh thik , ab agar bjp laa rahi toh kharab!!! logic where go"
Farmer's Friends Tractors  March. Thumbs-up   
Very nice analysis of anti national Rakesh Tikait. Thank you. Congratulations.
In reality Pepsi is right about their case against Gujarati farmer they developed a special kind of potato by years of research they have a pattern on the potato seeds you cannot use that I want to go to home which is high and dry contains to sell other than Pepsi and the farmer you are talking about is not a small one he is a rich fellow (200-300 acre property farming) used this potatoes to sell to the other competitive company of the Pepsi to gain a better margin in the product.. this is the reality and no one talks about it(I know this because I am in the same business)
The truth of the media revealed..... haha..... fortunately the farmer taught a lesson
"If corporates starts stocking up, the essential commodities will be costly even for the common man. The farmers are not just fighting their own fight but that also of a common man. We stand by farmers and want to congratulate modi for uniting us."
"This is defeat of Corporates n Victory of Farmers ! PROUD OF MY FARMER BROTHERS N SISTERS , I Salute their Valor for their rights"
"But I still don't get it. It finally boils down to which choice a farmer makes, right?"
"People should make ""Amar Kisan Smarak"" at India Gate as a tribute to thousand farmers died to save their farms from modern Ghori."
"Because of farmers, every household get food and because of them we are alive and it's really Shameful that farmers are not getting good support from Government. Farmers are ignored. When election comes, they say they will help farmers but after elected this is what we see as news."
The reason farmers did not go to supreme Court is because they knew supreme Court will favor government. 
Its defeat of real farmers today. Again politics wins over development again in India. I think now real farmers should educate themselves and ask the question to their leaders.
You hate modi for bringing farm laws and CAA I hate modi ji because he didn't enforce those laws
(Not sure if its mentioned / added in the bill but Govt ensures - MSP system and Mandis will continue.)
"3. In the 3rd bill, as per the Essential commodity act, one cannot horde food items beyond a certain limit now that limit have been struck off which means there is no limit on how much one can buy and horde. No wonder why certain Adani n Ambani are on a warehouse building competition spare across India much before the bill was passed."
Well done farmers . It takes a big person recognition his mistakes  well done Modi. Now bring the country together.
"Those who understand cold chain knows that this is the only future. It's similar to the way that right now air India is sold back to Tata, Indian govt. meddled in many things during 20th century which they shouldn't have meddled with this is one of those thing, APMC just did one thing that's to improve life of few farmers from a specific state.. "
Not Victory it is faliure for farmers
"Majority of Indians voted for a Govt. to run a country on behalf of us. We should support all the steps made by them, at least 5 years.Democracy doesnt mean revolts."
Start systematic targeting of godi media. Don't let those anchors rest peacefully.  Godi media ko kootna shuru karon.
Revolution stage: Modi stops roads now farmers will attack by drones.
""" Iman, Taqwa, Jihad Fi Sabililah"" is the motto of Momins of India. % proved. Justice for Kashmir Hindu Genocide.."
"If APMCs and MSPs are here to stay and the new Bill is providing additional option, Im failing to still understand what the problem is. ? What am i missing. Farmers can continue to seek in APMCs - whats the challenge. "
Farmers hai to hum hai
Well if you under NCP govt or Sharad Pawar. All the middleman business or agriculture Mandi's are been headed by NCP Congress leaders and most of the money generated here were cash and were in small in amount like Rs. 10-80 which nobody bothers much but this small amount becomes a big fund raising when it gets in number multiplication. And secondly it's a daily essential food products which are daily consumed. So just understand the amount of black money this sector generates. Hence this is the main source of black money generated by the political parties mentioned.
Farmers must be given respect and there due rights whether they are living in Pakistan or India because they feed the world
i am with farmers 
If you're stating the truth then say ki farmers have to negotiate not dectate terms.
We as Indians without a doubt should support our beloved farmers and hope the government and farmers find a solution. 
Why does he not cover middle men and the supply chain resulting in the loss of income for farmers? The middle has won more than the farmers.
