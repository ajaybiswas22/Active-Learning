How can a common people from other states can help farmers pls tell sir  thinking write a letter to PM if we all ryt atleast they can hear
2. Kishan bill Apas  hua ? Or drama of Modiji for the ensuing UP election. APAS bill kab pass hoga?
Union minister son was driving  The farmers have identified him.

Government should change this bill otherwise punjabi delhi nu hala dan ge GOD BLESS WHOLE WORLD  FARMERS  
Amrinder offertunist jai kissan farmers never forget atrocities muted on farmers abuses forcing loose police goons etc dont forget bros
""" I did what was needed for farmers, now I am doing what is needed for the nation"" "
Some ppl are saying this are rich ppl not farmers ....
Salute All Indian Farmers 
Now farm bills - defeat
"Two of my cousins are farmers by choice and are supportive of this law, but the unfortunate situation is:"
"I feel ashamed that people in order to support a party defend the brutal killing of farmers...Today,a video has surfaced where it can be clearly seen that the TWO cars were too fast and farmers had no time to react..They r depressed and now if this happen then riots will take place out of anger.."
We are grateful to have you as a journalist...voice of people..... Unlike godi media
Rakesh Tikait says so simply and straightforward about the situation
#isupportfarmers 
"There are APMCs before every act 1,2,3 and government assured that also . Why farmers pressuming that it APMCs will end soon."
"Well , What About the Economy Crash in Lockdown and petrol hikes. Stop playing the word game. Manipulation is at whole another level.  Don't play the tax card. We are already paying it in the form of our fuel. If you talking about minority , yes one minority is only being affected and targeted . So , Choose your words wisely and talk about the lost farmers the "" local of delhi """
Communist flags eh? Farmers you say eh? Do they know how Communists treated the Ukranian farmers? Or the Chinese theirs?
Govt repealing farm lawa : Congress still have problem  
"We can understand the circumstances which makes you to withdraw these bills which would have bring the better days for farmers, inspite of taking good decision for the future for us we failed you by no opposing those fake farmer's"
"11:00 with all due respect Shekhar, if Modi govt would have announced a law that would make them more strong in congressi voter base, congress being the china friendly anti nationals that they are , wouldnt even let the discussions begin."
Congratulations to all the farmers who risked their lives to fight for what was right
I always stand with you modi ji
Namaskar ravish Kumar sir lovely prime time today victory of democracy
Now Box understand  and says they are rich farmers not the poor one's.
Very well explained and I hope the farmers learn about their rights to get maximum benefits from these bills
"I don't think it's anything related to Punjab election. BJP stakes are negligible and someone like Modi having all experience that one can't win election like this, starting just 6 Month before."
"Punjabi and Haryanavi people are great and true inspiration..hope our Bengal, up Bihar, south all rise with such unity again..  love to all humanity"
2. farmers don't have negotiating power: farmers can force the governemnt of india to repeal the act which is for their own benefit. but the same farmer unions don't have negotiating power with private companies. 
5: is this protects  still really  done by farmers?. I variously  doubt  it.
Why you ppl allowed for tractor rally ?
Congrats to everyone who support farmer protest even on social media..Kudos to us.
Farmers have right to sell their crops wherever they want... That's freedom.... Also n advise to VOX y don't u compare the farming policy with America's n Europe's policy.....
"The whole story is not shown here, why are you doing like this quint. They look like Khalistanis not farmers."
"Even if the flag wasn't ""replaced"", how come it's a religious flag? Not all farmers are sikh."
Violence has  never been or will be the solution of any protest.. in my opinion what happened today on the Eve of  republic day was very unfortunate and it should be condemned but govt should also understand  policy or bill should not harm any group of people and it can seen from past few years all the amendment and bills brought by the govt has been opposed by various people of the country let say CAA now farm bill ... Govt should look into the this  matter seriously ...happy republic day brothers and sisters.
Accha hua kisaan ko marna hai to govt kya kare no need to do any reform for farmers
How  can other countries allow the Indian farmers to hold rallies in their countries knowing fully well that Mr. Modi has repealed the acts?
#istandwithfarmers
"If people can work in  bars as a government employee, then why can't farmers have a government job. In india government employees are well protected from harsh conditions."
"All tukde tukde gang. Its not farmer protest but just political rally in the garb of farmer protest. Its shame on the Tikait and his gang. They stoop to any low just to target Modi or Yogi Ji. UP should kick out Mulayam, Akhilesh and all the dynasties. And embrace Yogi Ji!"
What is going on respect farmers so sad after looking this news
"What a great democratic leader. Absolutely humble in accepting mistakes. It only took him 1 year, 700 deaths of farmers and by poll election results to take such a brave decision. May India continue to move forward in this direction of leaders like him for self-destruction "
"Nice informative video but left without conclusion? 1. Is the new farm bill better or worse for country? Who will lose, who will gain?  Please add this last part. Thnx."
"I have watched so many videos on this, but by far, this is the best explanation for all three farm bills. Kudos!"
Farmers are a pride Of india sharam ani chaiye apko kisan ke sath asa krtey hue
so the conclusion of your report is mandi owners are in loss not farmers
"The thing is the market system which was present before was not capable enough to do proper justice to farmers, as you guys have stated too. Even the present opposition has also mentioned that farming laws in India needs changes in a way that it gives more benefits to the farmers. "
RAKESH TIKAIT JINDABAD
This guy is so far removed from the farmers concerns - in my opinion (humble) he is another voice for the government.
