Thank you so much Dehliites for standing up with Farmers. Lots of love and blessings to you all.
"The tragedy of a democracy is that any political party can play games with the sentiments of the electorate and fiddle lies for narrow political wins. Although democracy is still the best form of governance, maybe we need changes to the structure now. I imagine sometimes, how India would have done if had followed a model like South Korea or Singapore. We talk about Pakistan because they had failed miserably but South Korea and Singapore had pretty authoritarian rulers"
"Actually yesterday in Punjab, 131.14 lakh tonnes of wheat has been procured, which is an all-time record. I think your video doesn't cover the entire situation precisely. There have been multiple talks between the farmers and the government. The government is ready to make changes to the law. But the farmers are adamant that they will only accept abolishing of the laws. The entire situation is very complex and hard to understand! Also when you are reporting some numbers, you should take the covid situation as well into account!"
"If farmers have 1 month memory, they will vote for BJP. If farmers have 3 years memory, they wil vote for any other party. BJP completely lost the plot. Disgrace"
"This same thing happened when  the privatization of electricity in 2002 takes place but we almost increased our capacity to produced electricity 4 times after privatization of this sector. The  protest also happened when the liberalization of indian economy takes place, but we know how it helps to uplift India economy ,now it time to liberalize farming sector whether people like it or not. But those who know little bit about economy knows that these law definitely improve the condition of farmers especially  the farmers of Bihar, UP, Bengal who have most fartile land but due to the government policy's they are poor. Punjab just afraid of not getting cheap labour from these states because after this law the farmers of these state become more phosphorus."
The law was good. they should've not repealed them. it's a loss for farmers.
In the long run this decision of repeal  will impose only negative consequences on the actual poor farmers.
"So called university ""educated"" people and intellectuals need to learn a lesson from farmers. UNITY AND PERSEVERANCE PAYS. If you are united, you can face any difficulty, including the pompous BJP Gov who thought they could roll over the farmers and gift a huge market to their ""funding agencies"" ... the Adanis and Ambanis of this world. Hey you can all eat crow now!"
This is the first time you spoke about farm laws modiji. Desh sub dekh raha hai
" When Modi was just six months old, India had hosted the first Asian Games in New Delhi and Jawaharlal Nehru introduced India's first five-year plan."
Farmers are our life line. They should be protected.
Farmers are our country bone so 
farmer doing local businesses with small farmer without regestred with government and going to door step to farmer buying cash in hand without paying tax to government this that main concern to those peoples this reason to rich middle classes Farmer  non regester business oweners are come out doing protests agnist new farmer law.
"Farmers are siting peaceful in Protest in Dehli more than 60 days , more than 150 farmers died due to Dehlis cold.!0 meetings between Farmers Unions and govt failed.I pray govt comes  farward to solve farmers crisis."
"For those who distribute ""Gyan"" on Kisaani and all.. I am not just come from farmer family, I do help in family farming as well."
Read a newspaper . You'll actually know more than what Indian or foreign media will tell you.
Delhi people also sport the farmers this is only one sector not in loss they always  battle performance then why need new lows
Actual farmers are working in their fields. These brokers are getting funds from Terrorist group like Kamishan and ISI.
"Nevertheless, farmers have a genuine fear about any government's attitude, irrespective of party affiliation, in respect of MSP. This is based on their past historical experience."
Bringing down our tricolor flag in republic day is not acceptable whether he may be farmer or nothing else now whole india will understand who they are what they are trying to do what they did now their slogans was nt related to farmer protest
Lol still calling them farmers 
Congress zero seats next election
Next level documentary with amazing cinematic shots! Really impressed to see this quality of documentary done by Indian Media! 
Finally protest ends and now the real farmers make a move for this 3 amendment laws
Three idiots finish our country (1) Andh Bhakt (2) Modi (3) Yogi finish our peace 
A hisak nahi hai kisi police ki Jaan nahi gayi it's fair iam with farmers
I am sure 90 percent of u who are supporting Farmers Don't know what exactly are Farm Laws...
"3. According to old farm law, states were allowing middle men who were monopolised to which only, farmers can sell their produce. These middle men were enjoying legalised monopoly in such a way that, they are the single possible buyer from farmers in their geographical areas."
"But the government  is not ending the MSP system. The opposition is lying  to the media ,thus creating a sense of fear among the farmers. Btw  loved your video , finally  I can understand  the whole  thing  ."
"Anyone if don't know, farmers won!"
decision could be made by our super hero's(farmers). In other hand government could represent there work from the insurance 
Give her address of you colic journalist who died and other 4 BJP supporters too..there family not weeping..they are celebrating..such shame..
Many Big farmers in India have bonded labourers in their field and they are talking about rights. Hypocrisy.
India owes you a lot Ravish ji
"He is an opportunist,his wife will resign but he will continue to support bjp, nonsense"
Khalistanis removed our national flag and we are supporting them?? You should have acted like Rajeev Gandhi
"I would have loved to find out how this impacts the other farmers - not just from the north indian states. For example, in my hometown, the farmers sell coconuts to the co-operative societies and they get paid around Rs.10 per coconut while it is sold for Rs.35 each here in the cities.The pricing is even worse for vegetables. All of this while they are plagued with issues like no labour, no water, floods. Obviously I can't rely on the regional media right now, because we are having our own drugs mafia episodes going around to cover up whatever it is that is happening here."
Sir I want to ask a simple question before this bill Private companies were not allowed to procure crops directly from the farmers?
Why this law was the problem only for Punjab farmers?
7. Finally sell the same rice to the same farmers and INDIANS for Rs.1000/kg. 
they are middle maan not kisan any funded by outside india.
My farmers is god
"GDP ki lgi pdi h,farmers ,the ones for whose benefits this law is being implemented are protesting..."
Rakesh tikait is ghereat leader
I will protect the farmers...
"The government made these rules to help  and support the rich traders and not the farmers. The problems that the farmers are facing wont be limited to the farmers alone, they will next show up in the general society as well. The current government has succeeded in placing the future of the next generation of children of this country into deep slavery by promoting endless privatization, transferring wealth to the riches, performing changes in rules that were protecting the democracy so far. "
"This is painful. We people get food because of the farmers and what is happening is really unfortunate, shameful and disgusting."
Shekhar ji. I believe we need another ctc to explain why Punjab and Haryana farmers are protesting new Farm bills and who is right and wrong and why. On paper farm bills appears right for farmer but we cannot ignore mass protest as case of mass hysteria. There are few arguments from opposing side we cannot ignore. Matter is not too trivial for large North Indian community. We need to cut the clutter and come out clean on what is right and wrong with opposition of these bills. Rest of the media is too busy being influenced by either side.
Tractor rally ko allow hi nhi krna tha 
For a long time I am a supporter of farmer but this is not accepted nobody is above the Tiranga.
"I am here to let the viewers know that in Rajya Sabha a voice vote was conducted to pass the bill even after a roaring demand for individual voting. Nor was the bill passed to Standing Committee. i mean WHAT THE ACTUAL FCUK. Would you like to comment on this, Mr. Gupta?"
"1. He keeps saying jat politics in Western UP, jat leaders and their stand on farmers agitation etc. This kind of language divides and presents jat community as one against all others ( or farm laws). Jats are divided on farm laws ( I am being from this community. I live in the US. I stay in regular communication  with my family members and friends. I find strong sentiments on both sides of the issue. Please SGji don't present farm laws as jat community issue. It is farmers issue and India issue. You come across as if you have biases when you keep saying jat community this or that ( perhaps unintentional). Please don't generalize."
Modi is wrost pm in the history of INDIA
