Finally Punjab and Haryana wins
please translate in hindi..our farmersmosly donoy understand 
"b) wasn't contract farming already allowed in agriculture before the bills? if yes, how is this different?"
Kerjriwal is right. Proud to our all India Farmers.
these  farmers didn't see the virus but saw the harmless from the centre govt.
Well done farmer! F the media.
"The real problem is even bigger than just taking back these new farm laws; the main thing already existing (as said here): large amount of trades between farmers and traders across the country don't ensure Minimum Support Price, thus putting the farmers in never ending debt, leading to thousands of suicides every year! Govt needs to ensure this too !!!!!!!"
8. BJP refused to have a debate on the bills. They rushed them through.
What a beautiful story !! Is this the same india ? Our Nation is changing  God bless our kisan 
What the Indian Govt. does to stop flow of arms into Punjab?
If bjp looses elections Then the soul of the farmers who died will rest in peace
This decision is taken by keeping in mind upcoming elections in Punjab and UP
Do you have data like over a period of 10 years how much farmers weath against middlemen
"Stay strong, farmers "
If they don't crush farmers then they will be alive
"Ive been following the whole kisaan andolan progress, please farmers should continue to protest peacefully, government are sending people to create violences, to bring division among the united farmers, for all these days the protest was peaceful, we dont know how and where these provocations are coming from, but as per videos and leaders, they are government people... One message: Farmers should stay UNITED!"
Produce of a farmer is eaten by people of all religion
Great punjabi and farmer bhai
Kisan andolan is a sponsered by Congress and other parties. 
"No matters if y'all Indian or not. They supply food from all over the world! No Farmers, no Food! So stand up! Or else, y'all ain't have onions on your steak! #standwithfarmers"
Repeal the 3 farm law and make new laws with consensus with farmers and other related specialists .
Abhi Sahab your views are true .  But make video on farmers issue and work of government on those.
Black day for farmers this day will be remembered  where reform lost and hooligans won
"*Allowing court trial for such disputes is never going to benefit, either by the farmer or against the farmer*"
"Gupta ji, please don't brush aside the concerns of those who oppose because it's unlikely that a farmer has the choice to transport and sale his produces wherever prices are higher. Also as of today only 6% of farmers get MSP benefit, so MSP is not removed doesn't hold much water. Also there's potential to corporatise agriculture, which is unlikely benefit farmers, remember Jio??"
#SuspendModi from Rajyasabha for blatantly lying about MSP being in the Farm bill
"Kindly give your attention to this issue also as it is highly related to the life of farmers ,  jamindars and land owners ."
summary -- educate farmers and reduce corruption.
Wounderfull My Heartfull Wishes To Farmers
Thanks or convincing speech on the farmers bill
We always support our God Farmer
"There are majorly 2 ends of this problem, at production end (farmer) and at marketing end. At farmer end, problem of seed selection, or credit availability or using ICT for connecting with experts is there and it is explained quite well in this. Further from marketing end, https://youtu.be/qb7x84PS4mk this video will help take some initiatives. In my opinion, small landholding is also one of major cause of farmers, as it restricts economics of scale. May we some co-operatives (like in lines of Dairy cooperatives ) can be formed in future."
"As far as the decision is concerned, I think the PM repelled it more because of the upcoming elections rather than farmer's trouble and concerns."
Ravish Ji you show the good prime show we proud for your work godi media destroy the democracy but you try live democracy this is tamtacha on bjp and godi media
"India is Currently #4 Agricultural Prooduts Supplier for  the World. If new Farm Reforms are implemented, Farmers will have Full Freedom to sell to Indian Big Companies, Producticity increases, Diversification increases. This means, America and China will see drop in Supply of their Agricultural Products, As these Indian Companies start selling abroad, Making India #1 Agricultural Exporter."
"Very interesting,  humble request please invite fresh    to  your  show  for   discussion  on current national political  scenario and pre & post farmer protest changing  in nation. I think  he is more eligible  for answering  your serious questions. "
Ek dum unbaised. Thank you. I support government but I also support farmers . Violence is no solution. Farmers should give suggestions to improve the bill not to repeal it because it will give profit to many farmers across India. But there must be some improvements in the bill.
These factors will help farmers produce natural crops and will save ecological balance
We shouldn't see only one aspect of any situation which our media/social media tells us.... Jai Jawaan Jai Kisaan
I wonder people say there was brotherhood between Hindu and Muslim .
I no support owasi and modi but mody 
"Dont break your team; all 32 farmers leaders should go  stick together; flock together, in front of modiji. If modiji accepted its fault, then you should take all your belongings and resolve all your problems. Later on nothing will happen as you know modiji like to decide everything by himself. Dictatorship"
If Modi wins election from  now on toe laaanat hai  tum sab pr bjp hataaav desh bachav
---Supported and financed the terrorist organization Tamil LTTE to rebel against Sri Lanka government
"This is one of the biggest protest in recent history. Already 75 days have passed. 160 farmers  already died. So, it is natural that there will be world wide attention."
.. My question for Godi media where was you in rallies?? Ankh me ___ghusa lete ho kya tabbb.. Bdk #GodiMedia.. So u hv no right to talking about covid on farmers..
Sir...you didn't consider Bihar farmers are selling their lands and going to punjab haryana and doing  labor farming.
Why does the Government want the three Farm Bills to remain and also the Minimum Support Price (MSP). 
These people are not just farmers; they are fighters. They are fighting since the time of great Ranjit Singh. Mighty British could not defeat their moral.  Salute to them.
The real problem is there are to many farmers in india for it to be sustainable.  The average farmer in india works a insanely small amount of land to be cost efficient.
It's a loss for poor farmers.
"After 11 round meeting, farmers are still at their stand, and 26 of jan, what happened every body know."
Kisans may have problems with the govt...but simple thing very straight forwardly closing borders is not good and Delhi govt on one hand is against pollution but on other hand supporting tractor rally may increase pollution and congestion....rally could have been avoided....
"Modi's motive and intentions will destroy the livelihoods of the common man.India rise up,overthrow this government!!"
Salute PM Justin Trodoue   we love you for your support to farmers and world peace and Human rights
