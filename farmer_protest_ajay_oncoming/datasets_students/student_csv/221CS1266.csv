2. It is fine that farmers can now directly trade their produce to corporates outside the purview of local mandies. In this context the following scenario ought to be considered.
It's about farmers please make video in farmer's language. Don't be like govt.who give English advertisement . @Newslaundry
"Most of comments are godi ,bika bagera bagera media, to ye vedios kia fake he ???? protest ka ruot dia huwa tha to divert q kia?... godi media kehne walo apko logo kia dikhai de raha he ki ye shantipurna protest he...? Kela andha"

I'm so much affended by this yar..., This Oscar awards showing so much partiality towords indian actors,  Look at our honourable prime minister's Narendra Modi ji, he is such an good natural actor."
Justice for farmers
"We don't see Punjab Kisan leaders , which were generally all the time were seen in the past surrounding Mr. Tikait.  Ex CM, Amarinder is trying to break them out. "
Modi ji great pm in the world
As a common indian I was very disappointed and feel insecure. No faith in supreme court and even in Central government. If These kind of kisan then no difference in devile and these kissan sorry to say
Sad for real farmer as a my half family/relatives are farmer 
We can see only Punjab farmers since 2 months of protest ?? Why ist so ? Its hijacked from Khalistan protestors.
"Ok, here what I got from this episode. To quote: 'it may not help bjp much, but it would damage Congress a lot in Punjab.'  Some times it feels The Print is the gang leader of right wing sanghi crowd."
Terrorist are briefing in press conference but the prime minister of. India not.       JAI KISSAN
INDIAN  POLICE PLZ SUPPORT FARMER.........MODI MURDABAAD
LOL to the killer of 700 farmers....
Ultimately Farmers Will Suffer. Climate will be Harm and Water level will deplit. Now Farmer Of This Punjab have no right to blame anyone but themselves.
Thats not a khalistan flag. . The people have sent a message that the  red fort and india belongs to the people of I didn't and farmers and not modi and ambani and they're big egos
Mismatch of Supply and demand will be reduced. Since farmers will produce per negotiated contract. Over production of agricultural produce will be minimised.
We should stop the food supply to all Godi media...than talk!
Police is  aggressive and You blame Kishan You are now a GODI Media India today Group 
"There are 2 types of farmers: one who are angry youth and want Khalistan because someone surely provoked them. Others, who were mislead by these people. Real farmers dont really have time to protest."
"""This is an attempt to make, by far the most unbiased and simplest video on the farm bills on the internet"""
"BBC is showing video of opposition parties of India? Isn't showing video and asking is enough? I have witnessed horrible violence at the time of Mayawati govt, Mulayam Singh's rule, and congress rule. They are telling the govt to take action. At the time of congress, my dad was attacked by knife in the hospital and still none of the police could catch the person who hs attacked. That was congress govt"
Farmers : YES!
All farmers will become rich 
What an attitude  when he says  ban Karo Taliban KO  he knows that India will never ban Taliban 
Farmer's demand is totally correct.
i think india is again back with its indian fragnance which gives indians a special bondage..the same bondage which kept indians united since its birth...defying all odds of diversity..we are one ..this is real hinduism..long live my country long live my countryman
Uchit routes ko police ne force aur baricades lga kr bnd kr diya . Tabbi farmers doosre km force walae routes pr chle gye..
"250 million good joke.. I live in Delhi, and my assessment is this protest never saw support of even 25 million farmers. And even 25M is not even 2% in India."
APMC fees (8.5%) doesnt get deducted from farmers income. Its being paid by buyer (FCI) on top of crops bill
"Long Live, the INDIAN FARMERS"
Why dont you get Farmer from Punjab to speak????
"Modi ji is not a dictator as someone has told here but people of India need to understand that this country has be sold out for 70 years , today it needs to be governed by an able leadership & that is modi ji"
Go Indias Farmers. Inshaallah You succed in your struggle
Those laws were to give freedom specially to the small farmers who couldn't get a chance to sell at their nearest mandi. The big farm owners used to exploit them by buying at law price and selling in mandi at high price. The poor farmers trapped in this protest and again lost its war of freedom and development.
Respect and Hats Off to DK Sir for this valuable talk !!!! This video should have at least 1 billion views in India  for everyone to know the reality and then make an informed decision and to impel our politicians to act and behave accordingly !!!! Jai Hind !!!!
I support Indian farmers 
My family were farmers back in their home country. So my love for farmers go through my respect for them and that my blood family was also farmers. 
(a)Farmers (b) Bharat (c)Opposition party (d)Dividend if any to be garnered in the coming UP and Punjab election (e) His Modiness gilding his image away from a mere politician to a statesman?
Should get a noble peace prize for putting his life at risk to protect his fellow farmers
Wait for 2024 modi will be literally kicked off parliament. 
I am amazed when i see people still supporting BJP & Modi.
"Prof.Gulati says Prof.Modiji could'nt convince farmers of the reforns!Its difficult to believe because Prof.Modiji ,it appears ,had written  and publised a book"" exam warriors '  "" for  students appearing for exams on how to  control stress and examination fear!"
"Before you give flak against the farmers, ask where your true loyalties lie. The union of India and her people, or the RSS and their political wing, the BJP?"
"Agriculture bill were cancelled just for the sake of elections, not to favour democratic attitude"
"farmers should consider amendments .... passing new farm laws will be a hectic process , re appealing  of laws will harm govt image ... surely agriculture sector need reforms let it start this way . Any problem in future will sharply affect the govt chances to win ...."
"What about recent farm bills sir , farmers are claiming they are meant to remove MSP ... What's the problem in farm bills...and sir they are claiming they are being pushed towards corporate sector.. which is not good for them"
Good job uncle ji from Haryana whose showing Identity Proof of his to verify that he is from Haryana. Hats off. Savage Haryanavis. Love from Punjab 
Fear of UP Punjab elections
These laws would have benefitted 95% of farmers in India. These rich farmers in Punjab and middlemen for their selfish motives scuttled this reform.
I would like to request india government to support Panchsher warriors in afghanistan
"Modi ka jumla, just like 15-15 Lakh , Amit shah will announce later that it was an election jumla"
"This is the victory of the farmers and a shameful defeat of the government's ego, arrogance and pro-capitalist policies. If the government and its leader had shown the wisdom at the proper time, lives of hundreds of kisans could have been saved. Hope that a little more  thoughtfulness on the part of government would fulfill expectation of people on bringing law on MSP."
You are a great enemy of the Indian farmers Mr tikait
