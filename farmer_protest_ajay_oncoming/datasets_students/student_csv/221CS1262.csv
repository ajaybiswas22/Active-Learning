Arrogant guy is silenced by the organized farmers. Hail Farmers
"If companies try to exploit farmers or use legal power, farmers still have choice of mandi or wherever they want to sell."
Firstly farmers laws are amended...
"The decision to repeal the farm laws is really very bad and it's gonna cost the loss of credibility of this government. But there is something that doesn't add up, because every common person knows that BJP is not even in the race in Punjab so how can the PM don't  know this. I don't believe this."
"China and India's military both made frontpage headlines in every country recently. China - Hypersonic missiles defying physics maneuverable unstoppable, evade all tracking radars. India - Helicopter crash with literally every important military personnel. Most senior commander, captain, general, officers, chief, squadron leader all onboard."
"After disaster of demonisation it is good because I came from farmer's family. And I know how bad are apmc now in india and corruption and cartilization stole the market and farmers get nothing as there are middle man in middle man's, so it becomes long chain of middlemen and destroys farmers."
Up haryana punjab Rajasthan elections k jalwa hai yeh  bcoz of your decision innocent people died for no reason
If govt has passed this bill to give benefits to the farmers. If in case in future somewhere if farmers incurred some loss due to this bills then govt duty to change as per the need. It is not compulsory that only bjp has to do it. It has to be done by the party who is in power. All time opposing is not the solution it will always keep us backward.
A victory to Humanity who could see Mr Modi was working for company profits with an agenda
South indian is like other country to modi we did not get any benefits
"May be tactical decision by PM to re-launch bill again with certain modification after election,as voiced by BJP MP's, Ministers "
"Progressive farm laws have been repealed on the context of failure in getting some farmers of 2 and a quarter state on board in a large country is a problem, since its shows victory of mobocracy and anarchy. The template is laid out and succeeded in demonstrating that reforms aren't possible if a few rich (farmers/individuals) take the streets despite a thumping majority. Its a pity. BJP is not winning Punjab, neither Khalistani threat is going away with this move rather Government has projected weakness and cluelessness. Opposition will use this template for sure but its not good for the country since external forces and think tanks of China, Pakistan and Khalistani terrorists have taken congnisance too"
"Can someone who understands this bill completely tell me why only the farmers of Haryana and Punjab are protesting while farmers from Maharastra, Mp, Up, and many others don't have a problem with this bill. Is this bill in some way affecting farmers of only these two states?? Or this bill only applies to some type of harvest which is predominantly grown in these two states. Pls don't give any political answers. Reply only if you have some valuable insights. Thx"
"Dear andhbhakts, let's say Taliban murdabad, iam not saying it to show patriotism ,and I don't care about that,if your boss Mr. Modi and his government is against Tabliban then why they are talking with Tabliban in Doha (qatar)?If Modi government recognises Taliban as a legitimate government of Afghanistan then what will be your position?will you left andhbhaki or you will chant""""""kuch bhi ho baap to humara Modi hi hai!!!!!"""""""
Farzi Kisaan neta  has been exposed badly now He is hiding behind farmers to save himself bolo ola hu uber
"This Rajesh tikait is not a farmer, it is a madman"
If people have minimum wage. Should not the farmers have a fair minimum price for his or her produces? The farmers had to buy seeds and chemicals plus paid rent for the land in order to produce his harvest to sell. 
First protest against CAA all across northeast and some part of mainland india and now farmers protest.
"Im standing with these farmers, they dont have any weapons and they are suppressed by the modi government. Water cannons and tear gas should not be used..."
"Khalistan The Punjsb Annexe report from the British government has been sent to UN and from UK supreme court by SFJ and nothing can stop the dream of having our own land back. India had its opportunity for 70 years to work with Sikhs and respect our freedom and beliefs but instead, we were treated like guardians of Hindustan Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji was disrespected time after time after time and one generation of Sikhs inPunjab were murdered by the indian state, For decades our people have lived under threaten by the Indian central government. If they thing Farmers will clear the decks of Delhi then they are even dumber than the previous guardians of indian government. Modi will be hung and his entire chain of command coming as far as CABAL and Billionaires will all be extinct withing the next 12 months just like Mughal empire and general Odwer."
Proud of being farmer proud of being sardar
love to the farmers from Canada
#in_solidarity_with_farmers
Modiji is First honest primeminister who done wonderful job . Never seen such a intellgent prime minster of india in the history of India.
"Meghnad has been quite fair to the proposed laws. Contract farming itself had been recommended by MS Swaminathan. The point is that since some of these reforms have already been tried out and didn't work out as expected, coz you know, the world is not ideal, doubts regarding their implementation and discussion of steps (with stakeholders) required to correct them are pending. The way the govt went about this is so undemocratic and farmers are clearly unconvinced is the problem with this. Last I checked, India is not an authoritarian state as per its constitution. Remember folks bold does not necessarily equate to wise."
"Lol I saw police throwing stones and fighting , farmers look better."
"We need India back,save India from Bjp"
There is no point in making statements based on what happened today. It was the resultant of continued torture and denial of rights the govt imposed on farmers who were protesting for their genuine cause.  Many of today's incidents were created by other malwares. You should be proud that the farmers still managed to conduct their protest and the damages ended by this. I would give full credit to them for conducting it this neat ! Actually I admire them. No other political group could have done this with this much precision. It was  a hard blow on BJP dictatorship 
It hurts makes me cry seeing our old people and everyone else too trying so hard to get their own rights this is the country which says jai jawaan jai kisaan and our kisaan is suffering so much just because of this one man narendra modi i don't know how he sleeps at night doesn't he gets nightmares.... god is seeing we are seeing someone's gonna punish this man so bad that he'll definitely remember everything everything bad he did.... karma man karma strikes back
So it's good for farmer's or need some improvement in 3 bills?
Police support bjp
Nothing wrong in asking for a discussion. Why are the laws being repealed ?  what happened?  Is it because the government could not bear to see more farmers dying at the morcha ? or some other reason like the upcoming elections in some states ? It is a democracy.
Farmers have been protesting peacefully for 2-3 months and most of them still are. But minority did get violent however what hasn't been showed is how the police was beating up some protesters who were causing no trouble at all. Some even speculate that these riots were planned by the government to put farmers in the bad light but no one really knows. Farmers have been protesting to have the newly introduced bills back.
Bloody goons should have some gratitude for the farmers who feed them
8) See Pakistani fake news propaganda that Indian Govt is against Sikhs! Not one opposition politician or farmer leader refuted this! 
Modi govt is wise to repeal the farm laws... But it was foolish to have enacted it in the first place...
"aren't these laws actually supporting the farmers then? if the leading cause of death of farmers acc to the government is financial duress, then doesn't it this indicate that income should increase by connecting buyers directly to farmers...what am I not getting here?... for all I know, the people protesting are the wealthy middlemen depriving the farmers of better income..."
Mr. Modi give Resignation... You are failed to give justice to our hardworking farmer's...
"All this laws have been imposed for the future planning. Punjab is the border state in india, which has land access to countries like Pakistan, Arabs and Russia. In future there will be no petrol or diesel and will be replaced by electric transports. { Short cut routes will be essential for transport}. So Adani and Ambani wants to own Punjab to take over the trade in future. These laws are to finish the land owners in Punjab and when there is no landlords then adani and ambani can control the trade in future. Punjab is the pathway for agriculture business in future worth billions of DOLLARS. First weaken the farmers and then take over their land. Then adani and ambani owns Punjab. Punjab is being looted for more then 40 yrs now... Drugs have been deliberately and purposely supplied into Punjab to weaken their youth. Bollywood is given the main role into supplying the deadly  stimulant,  people nowadays have trust on bollywood gods. This fight should be for all Bhartis not only Farmers, because these suckers are coming up to steal everything from us. Some countries are looking forward for these change for their benefit. Don't you think you all should wake up now. How much poor you want to be ? These riches ones are not originally  Bhartis. They are the lineage of italian , Israels etc. Fight now or NEVER.  May God destroy the blood suckers. { This statement has been simplified for ease understanding for everyone.}  Please watch the ' I goat  Pet II ' video as well."
"If Modi govt likes farmers so much our Amarvathi farmers are protesting for the past 2 years, why did repeal the good farm bills, just for Punjab elections?  Modi bent his head for the first time."
The farmers are protesting in a peaceful manner.And more important they are protesting not just for themselves but for every common men because it will effect the common man the most.
"the farmers protesting the farm bill are not only sikhs. In Punjab and Haryana  there are Hindu farmers , Sikh farmers Muslim farmers.  in Punjab and Haryana, the farmers are not only from from jatt caste or sikhs, there are also pundits, Brahmins , and dogar farmers in Punjab.  Farmers feed the nation, big companies like Tata, Birla, Reliance, Ebany,  Adnany  . These big companies are  controlling Modi. These bills are designed to   make  each farmer compete against each other so that big companies can buy crops at lowest rate, because farmer will have no option to sell to another buyer due to logistics and resources , and  the big companies have the logistics and they  will buy at lowest cost from Farmers and  export to other countries. This  will cause  food shortage in India,because big companies will  able to export the crops to more profitable buyers in other countries and the food prices will get more expensive in india. Modi is working for the  business tycoons, and big companies. The GTS is hurting the small shops, small factories, Modi needs to be removed from his throne."
India will never ever grow or advance under democracy.....good luck stay poor farmers
"Good Law . Bad Deployment ! Sad. Shows slamming laws down someones throat doesnt make it real. Consensus building through democratic means involving all relevant stake holders while can be slow and painful is the right strategy for India. People clamoring for muscling up strategy on any issue over consensus building approach should know India is too fragmented and diverse in its view points to be strong armed into one. This would have been the best time for Bjp to use its cadre to do drives related to benefits of these laws rather than employing rhetoric. Nevertheless the last part of what PM said gives me hope. All party committe while could set us back by sometime, should atleast get us some part of these laws back if not all. To the nay sayers of these laws , i want to say one thing. Market economics is the only reason why this country has developed in the last 30 years. To move against that would mean agriculture would continue to slip as a percentage of gdp.  We dont want to be a food importing nation again. Lets be 'together'and do what it takes to revive this sector."
Salute to student and farmers
Please do make a detailed video on how commission agents in mandis play with farmers
"Long live the revolution...well done Indian farmers, you pushed backed those fascists."
This video needs to be republished in all regional languages and shown on Doordarshan so farmers can actually understand what's the deal.
"These are not farmer's... These are rioters... Pls dont call them as farmers to shame original farmer's. All farmer's leaders are responsible to this incident and tbey all should get punished, best to send them jail"
Just one question..if you were a farmer would you be happy with the bill?
"Correct your facts first, not 70% but 84.67% farmers of india are small scale farmers"
Every political party had these laws in their manifesto at one time or the other. And these are good laws for the farmers and the country. 
Full support Talban From Pakistan
Phir se 12 Dec mega congress rally join us
I feel ashamed by watching our farmers condition
"Thanks buddy, great explanation. At end what you have mentioned abt cutting margin by corporates had already happened, where farmers had agreement with Reliance fresh, easy day like stores and as the produce quantity flooded the market they starting making excuse that potatoes size shouldn't be that large, radishes shouldn't be that long. So, all in all they asked farmers that potatoes size shouldn't be larger than some standered ring size. Here comes the margin cutting in scenr. So, where will farmers go in such scenario. Some helpless farmers has end up throwing their produce on roads."
