"So big corporate hoarders will create artificial gluts to buy cheaply from the farmers. And then create artificial scarcity to sell dearly to the end-consumers. So basically a lose-lose situation for both farmers and consumers, and a win-win situation for the private firms."
"2) They were saying that police and army are their brothers! ""If one person in a family is a farmer another is in the police or army"", they said. Now they have attacked the police who were showing restraint. How come?"
"Late. Lal Bahadur Shastri and Late. Chaudhary Charan Singh .... Both former Prime Minister tried well to make reforms and benefits for Farmers... But Sadly the regime was 4 years ,  6 months respectively"
"Our respect for the hon'ble SC has increased hundred fold for their Hinduphobic stance as seen from some instances: when  poll violence was unleashed in May June , when Hindus are being lathicharged and imprisoned for protesting the putting up of Pakistani flag etc , the same court sits as mute spectator !"
"These farmers cannot afford to drag massive corporations to court when they significant underpay them. The entire agricultural industry of India cannot be dictated by 2 or 3 laws alone. Each subsector agriculture has a different process of producing, selling and managing the crops. The ignorant media are misconstruing the real intent and purpose of these farmers."
Thanks for talking about farmers 
NOW farmers should not cry about middle men exploiting them because they themself stopped reforms
One of the biggest problems u missed are about the corporates which ruin the farmers
Ma'am with all due respect! I think a farmer can sell his produce outside the mandi or in any other state. Correct me if I'm wrong.
Punjab BJP government hota hee too aise nehi hota. Congress ka pura support.  Congress desh barbat kiya economically
If the government is in favour of our farmers.. That is the three law is not harmful to them then it should be proved by effecting step and realised the farmers that all are in their favour or remove the law by which everything will be okay... Otherwise the farmers who take such will never come back... and the situation may be very harmful
"Farmers won't drive dangerously  in danger ,there are people exploiting farmers"
Open market sounds good.but it is not practical in nature as majority of farmers are small and marginal .
So basically the farmers want to remain how they are... They fear change since that will bring uncertainty.
"Good explanation, govt is right and support new farm bill"
"They are middlemen. Long Live Comrade Modi . What the Left, Congress  did not do ...BJP has done that. The Peasantry is now free and industrial capital is introduced in Agricultural breaking the middlemen nexus with politician. Being a Marxist, I support BJP and PM Modi."
Congratulations to all farmers and remembering the ones who laid down their lives for this revolution..
People of India our farmers need us now let's support them. We cannot survive without food
IF U EAT FOOD THANKS A  FARMER............DONT BITE THE HAND THAT FEEDS U
These actions make some people still doubt farmers intentions.
I remember when shekhar uncle talked about the impenetrable fort modi and how history taught us that popular leaders has been defeated no one but themselves in Indian politics.
Ravish Kumar the real reporter of india
Historic victory for farmers and our Democracy 
"And seriously, the farmer protest is a farce."
We Eat because of farmers.. We have to respect them and their demands 
Very nicely explained Mr Manish Kumar thanks. I did not know anything about farm farming n farmers but now i got an idea why farmer community is suffering so much on the other hand we depend on them but they are unhappy with poverty n no means of surviving. They must b helped in all possible ways even if it comes to reducing pay of politicians.
"Please make detailed video on present farmer scenario, luved this VIDEo"
But the actual point is nobody force any farmer to make a contract outside mandi market.
"It just hurts seeing Indians fighting  against each other , and at that time when we shall show our maximum support to our nation"
Must Share Support Farmers ~
Still he is blaming farmers that they disregarded such an honest decesion of krishi Qanoon

"Two Nobel laureates,  both in Economics, both open about their no-love for PM Modi, have backed this law saying it's a great way ahead for the farmers in india. I neither understand politics, not understand economics, but I believe these Nobel laureates. Still Mr Rathee wants to prove that the law was wrong. Clearly, no one values for education or expertise in this country."
Farmers are real heroes. They will show what power is.
Shame on modi you must listen the voice of kisaans
If you really wanna know all about farm bills do watch Dr. Vikas Divyakirti Sir's  vedio on Drishti IAS instead of these so called ''intellectuals'' like him who can only give you a lopsided perspective on topics of national concern.
"Nice presentation on APMC TAXATION but mam kya protest sirf Punjab ke kisan ker rhe no body else ....gujrat ke pass apne source hai taxes ke ,MH ke pass apne ....Punjab ke pass or kya hai fertile  land ke sivaye .....I believe ki gov APMC ki condition sudhare mai kaam kre to wo in reforms se jyada better hoga"
I support  framers .. But today we not support farmers .. Ja galat kya kisano ne ..

"4. Sir, i am not well aware of Farm laws. Yes, i believe that MSP may increase food subsidy. But indirect removal of MSP through Farm laws is not in the interest of farmers future. Government did not included MSP in farm laws. He only ensure guaranteed price which is governed by private trader and farmer. And we well aware the farmers were not afford negotiations with such big players. Government says, MSP is administrative matter not a legesative. In my opinion government must ensure MSP to the farmers in written form for safeguarding the interest of farmers. "
God bless all those fighting for their rights and huge respect this is the land of farmers !!
India is a very vast country and half of her population depends on farming. Nearly 500 to 600 millions 
2. If every farmer would just grow MSP crops then any suggestions on problems that may create agricultural imbalance in the country and problems of the other non MSP crop farmers.
Modi being a farmerlike himself had forgotten the plight of farmers after occupying the highest office in the country. It's unfortunate.
Why aren't any protests around the whole country? Especially in the other agricultural states? Why only Punjab and Haryana?
These are not farm bills these are private company welfare bills
"Shekhar ji your analysis made so much sense but when I reflected on it, it struck me that only farmers of Punjab haryana and Jat farmers of western UP protested."
Good Modi realised that he is not king and farmers and common people are the ones who run this country
"Rakesh Takait has contested assembly and loksabha elections before, he lost both elections. He got a  irrelevent issue to start a agitation. Most of these laws already existed. He has consciously  taken the support of Khalistanis & other anti nationals to make it deadly."
These farmers leave farming
Pakistan and china funding these protests using punjab ruling congress party
"Ppl who are agitating in the garb of farmers are mainly middlemen whose empire has been demolished by these 3 acts,as we all know these middlemen are mostly small/mid level political leaders who controll the Mandis,its a revolutionary act which will change the farm sector of India"
"accept Muslims in your Country, busy talking about Talibans while u discriminate Muslims in your Country"
"Doing babri demolition thimes the guns,granade,barricade where not invented yaar,where where you the brown shirted waalas,hats off farmers,They stay silent for more than two months,but you underestimated them because they are only farmers,you will now arrest many farmers because you have everything but sure you will suffer lot ,this is just a beginning of your nightmares."
Stop calling them FARMERS !! IT'S A POLITICAL GIMMICK  .. NOTHING MORE
