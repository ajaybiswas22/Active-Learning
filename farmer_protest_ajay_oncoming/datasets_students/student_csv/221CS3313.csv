"Taliban are quick learners version 2.0 Learning from Israel,  China and India. How to control protestor?"
Seriously Modi brought India into hell.
"Guptaji, also highlight the fact that, the tax-paying citizen pays MSP twice. Once, in tax and again as part of MRP. So, if MSP is made law, mandi must be abolished to save the tax part being wasted. Everyone worrying about farmers. What about taxpayer?"
He said give 2 options about of 101 solutions. Salute this Farmer.
Rakesh tikait you are saying right 
Victory to farmers of India!!
Or are those farmers also into same turmoil in the hands of a big company?
The number  of farmers on agitation were negligible in comparison to   our huge population and that to a limited states    so it is really splendid  what made the central govt to bent down  it is so happened due to our weak  administrative system  the states are equall
And no government has. Even able to significantly create jobs where the farming community can be weaned out of farming which is becoming more & more poorer as 86.5% of the farmers have less than 1.5 acre of land and this holding is continuously reducing. You can see the exodus of farmers abroad from Punjab where this is a major reason although some bigger farmers also emigrate due to the quality of life abroad. However majority emigrate as farming is not viable and there are no suitable white collar jobs available elsewhere.
when history will written in future .. godi media would be most darkest spot on that
It's Duty of PUBLIC ...To help FARMERs.... not GOVERNMENT 
all the three acts are in the favour of farmers..protesters are the middle man and they are not against the act rather they are against the farmer..
Modi should give one more good news by resigning from the post n handover it to someone educated like Swamy or someone else. Next he will sell india to Ambani or some rich clients.
"*Police should stand down. They are caught in the politician puppetry Let the PUBLIC face the Farmer protesters, leaders & politicians who are protesting, disrupting traffic, creating ruckus... violence etc. Let Public face the violence, only then will the public take action against these fools and support the police*"
India's agriculture development is not even in dreams. Good luck Indian farmers. Slow claps for you guys 
"If he wants parity in Income with 1967 prices, than let there be Income Tax on agriculture. The farmers are spoilt by Political Parties bcuz of vote politics. If you add up all freebies and subsidies given to farm sector, they might b getting more than the cost of produce."
I support government of India for all the law and regulations implement by them to make India a better place. Strict action needed to make country better.
What about And what's the difference the proposal of Dr Manmohan Singh then finance minister in 1991 and the present farmers bill.That time BJP opposed the proposal and that proposal became silent .It should also be studied and discussed .
"Good Presentation, Alex can you explain about Indian agricultural commodity markets, it is meant for hedging the risk and price discovery, but the farmers participation is very less. Can you explain the reasons"
Support Farmers Protest 
Why farmers required weapons
"We the people of India never feel better towards EVM Scammer rulers  repeal of farmers law, it's like crazy crocodile tears and double faced Snakes playing role, suppose if research from ground survey speaks nearly 10 crores farmers signed Contract Farming papers, intellectual estimate, evaluate realize later FUTURE facts TRUE PREDICTION be recorded this comment, in other words Modi RSS won the match surgical strike dramatic footage,"
We hope and pray that Taliban takes over pakistan too. Inshallah.
*The Farm Laws were being used to create a wedge between Hindus and Sikhs in Punjab and the Khalistan Movement was piggy backing on it and a full-fledged return to terrorism was the next step.*
When Krishna avoided fighting with jarasanth and leave Mathura and create a place called Dearika. HE IS GOD and by Sudarsan chakra He can easily killed him. Instead as if HE was running from Mathura. Like that Modiji may have a plan and for that Punjab election may be vital. Now He may face criticism and we may come to know the reason later. I am sure GOD is taken full control and HIS plan will be done and who knows what is in store for the World.
"I'm strongly support modi, but if bjp bring this bill,,than believe me bjp forget about center, they can't even getting any provincial govt. & first-time rahul saying right, i know even he doesn't know anything about this matter, "
"I was knowing that the farmers were protesting in kurukshetra but I was not knowing why, but now I got to know"
Thank you for such a sensible explanation at a time when the political parties and the farmers of certain states are not willing to understand the real part of the bills!
3 . Modi is saying it's going to be 1 nation 1 market. It already 1 market we can sell our crops anywhere in india legally before this. 
A serious wrong decision...but modi has to do it for elections
Farmers will show the true feelings of every true Indian...
The farmers are more educated and Intelligent than our Prime Minister and Home Minister...What the farmer said are all well said...
Those are khalistanis. Farmers are with the country. These shameless people are Against India.
More than 700 farmers died many suffered in protests.
"Farmers know what is good for them...govt jitna jaldi smjhe utna hi acha h iss bat ko.... And what was the need to pass such controversial bills  during a pandemic? Govt wanted to take advantage of the situation, they thought they would be able to suppress protests.....they were wrong....they forgot punjab is the land of Bhagat Singh..."
"Entire northeast is our farmers Go for it my dear brothers we are alwys with you...My dad is a farmer, and so do I."

12)All transaction between farmers and consumers are must be in white. I really encourage to do digital transaction if possible.
When Muslims were targeted in CAB and they protested for their rights against CAA they were called Jihadis and Pakistanis. And now when farmers from Punjab are protesting for their rights. They're being called Khalistanis.
"Both are correct ,debate must happen in Parliament, in the farmers point they expressed their concern,if the govt agreed to give MSP ,I think it is good reform."
First they are not farmers because in democratic countrie you can protest but this kind of  
Farmers have become new Kashmiris.
"What a land mark,historic revolution but also the most peaceful ever,only hope that the farmers dont loose their patience as the present govt is hell bent that the farmers do loose their cool and do something violent and the blame shift on the farmers thats the reason the farmer unions time and again request the farmers to be peaceful"

"*The main reason is  ""Out of 29 seats in all India byelection bjp, rss team managed to won 12 seats only, out of 12, 5 seats in Assam. BJP, Modi, RSS, Shah, Yogi  GAME OVER*  "
I have lost all sympathy for the farmers now. Only Law can give justice to Lakhbeer Singh.

Modi has thrown india into dark ages.
This is what happens when somebody who doesn't know hoots about India & it's farming issues tries to support under the garb of being funny... Trevor expected better research .... No wonder they day agendas drive social media these days...
