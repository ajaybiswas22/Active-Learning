PUNJAB GONE For congress!
"Moral of the Story- EVMs can only bring you to form a government but they dont give you power over people unless the people really vote for you. As far as BJP is concerned, whenever Modi is gone BJP is finished and if the EVM truth comes out before that then then BJP will be banned and Modi is in Jail. RSS will have to form a new party. "
4. Exploration of farmers
Farmer zindabad pls  I request all farmer pls don't trust this man he his  a big lier Now he know BJP will b no more in country
"Hopefully, all the states except Punjab,  will bring in the same farm bills which are supported by 80% of the rest of the Indian 'real farmers' . Reassess the MSP for Rice and Wheat food grains which are over supplied and affecting water supply. Modi should come clean for the real reason for repealing the farm laws to regain people's trust  and the people have a right to know."
"60k Afghan Talibans & Pakistan *vs* America & NATO(55-Countries Alliance), India, Israel, Afghan Puppet Government & Private Armed Forces (Black Water, etc). Russia, China, Iran and others also Support Afghan Talibans & Pakistan but they aren't directly involved in a Conflict."

farmer on top
Middle man bhi APMC i.e sarkaar hi thii to private indroduce karne ka mujhe nhi lagta koi acha reason h bcz jo private wale karenge wo hi agar APMC kre to farmers ko bhi koi problem nahi hogi.M S P ko continue rkhna chahiye.
Long Live Farmers.
"Shameless and Arrogant Prime Minister. According to BJP, Democracy starts and ends with Election."
"i m not a political guy but this is not a kisan andolan at all. modi ki publicity km krne k liye, kisan , gribi ya soldiers bus yhi to trike he, opposition k pas ...aur unhone use krna sik liya he "
"How come the committee MISSED HUMANITY ASPECT Poorest of the Poorest Farmer...The Apex court must dwell into this ,Normally HON PM MODI JI decision for the FAUZI and  Farmers is Spot on, let us wait for further update..Jai Hind  Jai Sri Ram"
"Tikait was  only a puppet in the name of farmers, why had he not made any movement when thousands of people committed  in Maharashtra during 2006 to 20011"
Look India media. I have many Punjabi friends. One thing I know about them is they are never wrong. I support farmers from my country.
"If you ask anyone who supports this protest then they'll say the new laws will create an existential crisis for the poorest of the poor farmers. But when you point out that these ""protesters"" can be seen driving a freakin G-wagon, then they'll say: So you believe farmers cannot be rich?"
First Time I Had Seen Police Is Pelting Farmers With Stones

Say no to socialism: life is difficult. Get a better job than just being a farmer and stop complaining
All these years farmers in Maharashtra were doing suicide because of these farm laws. Now they will all live in luxury. Thanks to their support to Punjab farmers.
There's no mention of that farmers can't go to HC or SC in case of dispute with private company.
This chap is still saying the farm laws were good. Couldn't expect anything better from this Bhakt of Modi and BJP.
Thank you Farmers. India will be ever gratefull.
"In the age of AI & automation, blockchain & e-commerce, 5G & neuralink etc etc , our farmers are being held hostage by selfish few with vested interests. "
Actually Modi government was too adamant.actually bjp always doing favour for corporate.
U can kill farmers but u can't kill thier purpose
"My grandfather were a framer and I support farm law. We are obsessed with middle man and want to eliminate farm law. The people who are protesting are either mindwashed or middle man. Our people also deserve better life. Time will come when Punjab doesn't get  cheap labour from Bihar,UP,MP, Rajasthan and Bengal and it's time  for us to rise. It's the same Punjabi who fought with britishers in 1857 first war of Independence against us. The country are with the farm law."
"We r with farmers, love from hyderabad"
Sir aap bengal chale gaye the election ke time ek bar Ghazipur border pe bhi aa jate to shayd farmers protest khatm kr dete...
If any farmer need to sold his things to private companies direct then we do not need this bill anyone can do this. 
"I am from Bangalore people in.metro are mislead by mainstream media, please make videos in English and South Indian languages as well so whole country is United in the heavenly cause if there is god please bless our farmers"
The indian MUSLIMS helping them wow 
"Today, Farmers are leaving from this place after a year protest."
farmers good power show
This a really a backward move. Simply political move. I did not expect this from Modiji & BJP. 
"This is not a farmer's protest but a Khalistani separatist protest (nothing to do with our  nationalist Sikh brothers and sisters) which was earlier nicknamed as ""Referendum 2020"". Almost every Indian farmers are actively welcoming the new farm lays, which will remove the evil middlemen who exploit the farmers and buyers. For eg. Farmers are forced to sell potatoes to middlemen only for 2 per kilo while those same middlemen sell the potatoes to common citizens @  30 per kilo. Shame on you Al Jazeera for supporting terrorists and anarchists."
"Why the hell all opposition back farmers and it it as if thier victory ,one idiot comparing modi to ravan also this is cheap politics... Indias should  come to street and fight for correct fm laws to be implement which modi did..."
The government has egg on its face. Finally the farmers brought the government to its knees
This incident surely changed our perception of farmers as helpless and ignorant lot.
Thankyou so much for your support. We need more local Delhi residents supporting our farmers 
There is no reason for farmers not to be in control of their own crops
"BJP Is blind with arrogance,  Yogi has messed up, Yogi should resign"
"Farmers Don't have IT cell, so they become victim of the Propoganda, unlike Political parties, So we have to stand for them to become their voice."
WE ARE ASHEMED OF OUR DENIOR LEADER RAJYASAVHA MEMBER & THEY DONOT HAVE RESPECT OF PARLAMENT.AS THEM WHY I CAN NOT SELL MY PRODUCT OPENLY INMARKET WHEN CAN BUY ANYWHRW BY MY CHOICE??.ONLY FARMER CAN NOT SELL!!!!!
if farmers dont want to improve their situatio n just because of cheap politics then no one can do anything
"Also, Rakesh Tikait in a way is also a hero, leading not just the farmers but entire India from the front. I hope he does not disappoint us later."
All the Indians here loving Taliban. 
"Shame on Indian Media, Indian Government, Indian Prime Minister, Delhi Police, Delhi Chief Minister."
Farmer is god for us
Repeal of law is a loss to the real farmers and the nation.
There were some media channels which went to great lengths to explain the benefits of these farm laws. Begs the question now are these laws good or BAD. What about those farmers who died during the protests.
Well done Modi. Punjab is sure shot to come in BJPs ambit with Captain Amarinder.
