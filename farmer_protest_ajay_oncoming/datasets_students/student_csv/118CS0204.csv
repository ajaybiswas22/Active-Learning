Evil ....God help your farmers 
Very good farmers i hope you'll get rich now right? India is a failed democracy accept it or not.
"Catchhold those leaders who were claiming that it is farmers protest. Now it's clear that it's not farmers andolan it is andolan of aatankwaadi, it is terrorist Andolan"
"No farmers,  no food , starve. Simple."
"What a hypocrisy and liar, telling only small segment of farmer failed to understand their enlighten laws for farmers betterment. What a sick man still glorifying himself and his sick policies. Never Again."
Farmers  the real heroes of India... Who are ready to die for our future.. 
So in conclusion this protest had nothing to do with farm bills but something that Punjab wants for past several years and that is their own rules and own country? Punjab either needs to learn to reform or India needs to find other channels. Govt should not be forced to pay for poor quality product just because of set minimum. If companies ran the show they wouldve had to do things correctly and thats what these farmers all fear (inability to cut corners).
Please make a video on why farmers are not getting promised MSP. As you said only 6% farmers get the promised MSP. Pls make a video addressing this issue.
please change the name of Zee news of BJP news
This is blackmailing from farmers
As Kisan working on advice of oposite party and  other party interesting fall of Modi anhow. Modi agreed Kisan proposal but opposite if permit to kisan they will drink water. Regards
#isupportfarmers...
"Is liye BJP hatao desh bachao  ,,Dil se Congress "
Repealing laws is not  going to help bjp gain ground in coming elections. Modi is too late to announce this.
Modi does not care about the sikh farmers Punjabi farmers. Its the truth
"I think 'they' know that it's better allowing farmers their wish on 26th Jan,  than having a face off with them !!"
Government and godi media dono hare hai.... 
Now there should be a new protest by real farmers :D
"Bro, if Govt. wants to get out of Agri businesses, then what's the guarantee that the farmers will get protected from or out of these  bills..!!"
"I agree with Shrees perspective, Modis decision to repeal Farm Laws there must be many more reasons "
    bjp   congress   
"Unfortunately, the media did not pursue champions of the laws from within the silent majority and give them airtime in equal measure. Mobilization of stake holders (in this case farmers) in cities & towns across India, albeit on weekends, would have forced Protesters & Politicians opposed to these laws to ratchet down their rhetoric and forced the media to present a counter narrative."
"So if Punjab & Haryana protest & no other major states are protesting then might be political influence. Else, entire country is mostly into farming. So country should have been burning if all are not happy with it!"
Power to farmers of India . Love from Nepal .
"Take down the controversial farm laws, problem solved. I completely blame the govt for this. You make laws for the farmer & the farmer did not like, then, why still force the law??"
"Sir,bill no where says about msp,APMC closure etc. But indirectly  causes closure/end of same.if YouTube channel subscribers are left with choice to subscribe only one channel in youtube,the person who offers best content or better price, slowly gets maximum subscribers and such subscribers will have no option but leave your  YouTube channel. According to me atleast."
Indian Farmers we stand by you..keep it up lots respect
He is Indian farmer. Keep it up
Reform is the crying need of time with slight changes which govt is also trying to modify but rejecting the bill is going to push farmers in same gutterwhere we will say ki lays to 10 me 2 aloo deta hai aur bechare kisaan 1 kilo ke 5 ka benefit hota hai.  Peace 
Those who say this is shameless they never felt shame on our govt when 150+ farmers died(gave shaheedi) while protesting
There are more than many medicinal plants/herbs that can be grown in many parts if Punjab& Haryana.
Like the dispute between farmers and corporates will not go to court but will be settled by an Administrative officer. This can lead to favoured judgment as the law will not take ita due course
"for those asking why only 2 rich state farmers are protesting..because they have the means.. Because victims lose their voice after a point. they become moot ..it doesnt mean they agree. i beat you, and you are silent, doesnt mean you are not gettig hurt..and if another person whom i beat screams, doesnt mean he is getting hit harder. understand the scenario. poor dont have tools to speak up."
"Indian has deployed 1 million Army in Kashmir to stop the voice of innocent Kasmiri people, now what will they do with their own Farmer protesters who raise their voice against  hinduta Govt who are involved in descrimination of minorities"
When the pm is uneducated and farmers are educated
Zee news always know his duty ......zee news depend on bjp vice versa I
Meanwhile the Guardian and BBC are so busy covering stories of India.. India gifted 3.2 doses of vaccines...Yes farmers protest is of higher priority but when did Western Media look at priorities over facts
"the law is came for only real farmers dear,not for like u people,,,,,his product he have to sale in high price for his welfare,not for ur welfare,also in india have lot of buisness peoples so there shold be a competion,so farmer can choose the costomer,   the all farmers are misunderstant by the polititions.this mandies policy cause all year lot of lose for farmers."
"The moment u think about a neta that he is different, seconds later he disappoints u, didn't know pm modi was this spineless, swargiya Kalyan Singh ji must be very disappointed by watching pm modi tossing up values & his supporters pride like this #FarmLawsRepealed, I've voted thrice n all for modi & even now I will not vote for anyone else but now I'm thinking I will not gonna vote for modi, I think I will still out, I will waste my power, my vote becuz Modi has betrayed me"
"""NOBODY IN THIS WORLD IS MORE PATIENT THAN A FARMER"""
When few businessmen run the country and a wellfare state starts to act like a broker to business entities then this happens.. Standing with farmers..
"If the Laws are repealed,  Modi Govt will learn its lesson that the Indian Constitution and India's Federal structure cannot be kicked out of the window. We are NOT OPEN to fascism and anarchy and single party system and dictatorship ... not necessarily in that order."
Yep in south Gujrat Amreli farmer use solar and get free power and other all useless power give electric company and they pay 70000 per year my some relatives are doing this
Jo Kiya wo kissano ke liye especially for small farmers ..
Is ON in the revised name of farmers.
Nakli Kisan? Wow. Tehari got the fresh installment from BJP
Same way Modi will say SORRY again on 370.. Loot India Gujju model want Kashmir not Kashmiris..
*We stand with farmers and their justice jai jawan jai kisan*
"3. personal relationship with middlemen : so the poor farmers all over india should not be given an option to sell their crops to private companies directly, because middlemen of punjab can give personal loans to punjab farmers. and farmer all over india are dying due to their poverty. but there should be a protest to save a personal relationship between punjab farmers and middlemen.  "
One day Pakistan will also under Taliban control that day imran khan will know how Afghans has suffered
Shame on farmers who did not understand the importance of these laws.
Congratulations! To All Farmers...
Thank you BBC for a better coverage as asking the dumb farmers spokesman the right questions as some of your coverage on issues regarding India have been biased.
Please make a video on pros and cons of farmer bill.
Going wrong with farmers.
"If farmers are so called ""KHALISTANI"" ...that means we are being feed by khalistanis"
