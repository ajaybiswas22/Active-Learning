Modi ji has failed once again on farmers and Sikkim village of India occupied by Chinese PLA
My father is a commision agent . We share a very lovingly bond with farmers. They use to greet him chacha me as a brother. We were known about these things from past 3 yrs. that govt. is going to take action against mandis. After your video we are fully sure that we are fully awared with the laws. In my opinion govt. Should take actions before speaking much. Sirf bol rhe hai ek aadha kisaan ki maang ko lekr law enact kr diya jaaye. 
"I'm here before people start calling Trevor ""pakistani"" and ""khalistani"""
I am not totally agree with your comment that export if on I an to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. But onion is   very commonly  used by poor people in Hindi belt . If onion prices goes up in India because India wants to keep up its commentmwnt to export when our own people are suffering due covid 19 no income to spend freely then it is not the responsibility of our Govt to protect owen  people.
Bjp party terirest party in India go back go back modi all state in India go back go back modi
"Finally, The consequence of any decision can be seen only when it's implemented but once privatization is in place, Agricultural market is open for competition for fair price market is also a theory which can be given support by minimum purchase price."
It's just Punjab and Haryana farmers which are unhappy
Pm modi is a great leader in India
Salute u brother for covering! It's painful to see farmer's condition. I can say something for sure they aren't the ones involved in the riots happened in today's rally
Now its the time to take U Turn by an Indian Govt to support Taliban instead of Afghan Govt.....
There has been no dialogue between farmers and modi. Modi never went to meet the farmers who were run down by his own ministers son. So many farmers gave their life during his protest. Modi's always doing U turns and never fulfilling any promises he made. He is useless and only in his head is he a strong man. China is invading India and Modi can do nothing. He's a coward. This report is wrong! It's not emotional at all. Farmers are wise.
"If the middleman was serving the purpose, then why were farmers unhappy and committing suicide?"
stand with farmers
We always support farmers  
I am always with modi ji and will be i am proud of modi ji
          Salute to Farmers who are struggling for survival of 75% population of the Nation linked with agriculture and  protesting against the atrocities of corporate politicians who are trying to giving control of National food grains in the hands of some corporaters for profit purposes.
"I don't understand when government thinks that it's good for farmers then instead of talking to them who are  sitting near Delhi Borders , they are going here and there and throwing the tantrums .."
The government was given 60 days to solve the problem but they didn't. So now cry and weep. It's a simple equation because government should realise that they are in power and if they can't settle the affairs of its citizens then it's of no use and especially when it's about farmers.
#Farmers are feeling insecured.
Rise of a new Era.... Our farmers are going to be the extreme winners 
We are with farmers 
"Thank u so much sir, for the information. I work as gram panchayat secretary this information will help me in guiding the farmers, I will share this video with my friends too...thank you sir."
This is an inspirational story. I wish those farmers the best.
Why people treat farmers like they are something above everything they do farming to earn not to feed us for free they are doing business same as everyone doing
Farmers need to store their commodity for atleast two months
And also why no punishment to Taini for killing innocent farmers protest silently with vehicle????
What a shameful act by BJP on peaceful citizens. It's unforgivable. British hanged estimated 1200 Indians before granting independence. Over 600 farmers already dead and one more died off injuries yesterday. BJP wants more.
Isme benifit kuch nhi hai yaha farmers msp me apna saman sale karenge aur dusre hath local market me prices apne aap increase ho jaegya... This is inflation... Vegetable sellers will be rich by the day... By making fake stories like they use to tell...
"It's not about religion,it's about humanity,why some people are supporting Taliban and saying Afghanistan become independent. How come Afghanistan become independent when their citizens are suffocating in their own country with Taliban regime"
Govt. : These farmers are terrorists !!!!!
"Why does the government not provide MSP on other types of crops? Why MSP is provided on crops like wheat only? Is there any reason behind that? If MSP is provided on other types of crops, I think it may encourage our farmers to produce different kinds of crops other than wheat. This will reduce the over-supply of wheat and hence reduce the wastage of wheat getting rotten in storage facilities. There must be some logical reason behind this."
What about small farmers who were benefiting from these laws... Very disappointed from the govt.
These are not Farmers protesting.. these are the middle men losing their share .. also supported by opposition and retired and tired politicians who have now admitted they cant beat Modi democratically are trying their ill luck
"This only happen in bjp ruled state , harrasment of kisan . We support kisan ."
Don't defend the farmers by saying they are not farmers.
"I am a law student , My father is a Farmer. Thanks for rising your voice, disscuss about the real facts of farmer. Love from Assam."
"I agree with all of this. But then, why are the demands put up by the representatives of our farmers to the Government totally unrelated to these issues?"
"Its been six months now Protest still going on peacefully. government and godi media tried to manipulate and call them terrorist but truth never dies please guys support them do tweets on Twitter because this is your right to speak right to say In democracy, and read about your rights."
Sir Best wishes to those all Farmers and those Media channel who stand in front of this Government and stand with correct things thank you 
"This bill had many advantages to farmers.. with the direct intervention of private players will reduce the chance of wastage of crop grown... This will improve the technology investment in farming that reduces the burden for farming.. and many advantages.. India has a myth stating farmers are uneducated, innocent but in reality present generation is not like that. Instead of saying private players can loot farmers let us educate farmers"
-> fear of losing farmers support
"80% of farmers didn't see the farm bills, benefits, didn't see the rules & protesting on others words..."
RIP to poor farmers
I am with bill. Ye government kuch to ker rahi hai farmers ke liye
It is very bad day for india..bjp is right
BJP is doing big drama these days. Begs votes in the name Taliban and Pakistan but jaishankar made a meeting with Taliban last month. BJP thought they will make lot of money by investing in Afghanistan from its lithium reserves. But now 3 billion Indian money is put into dustbin....!!!!
That's why punjab government is protesting in the name for farmers 
"Even if these laws were brought with intention to improve farming sector, the manner in which it was passed in the parliament n the timing raised doubts. Now the government needs to build trust with the farmers n hopefully bring about some reforms in the near future."
Media is behaving as if farmers don't have minds of their own... They are definitely not misleaded
Now diversify msp procurement from all states in equal ratio...not keep them specific to punjab haryana up
No secularism india is a hindu nation hindu unity forever 
It would have been better if you had done little more research on farm bills and had explained government's point of view too.
If farmers stop farming there will food emergency just like in Sri Lanka .V.Bad adminstration by BJP.
Wah! Kisan kheti mandir m nhi krta respected anchor
*Farmers >>>LOST*
