The person who stopped that water canon as we saw that video was accused of attempt to murder and almost every farmer leader is threatened by  gov with income tax department is sending them notices
"Talking about Modi Ji's Govt, then this is the govt who had looked into all matters."
Hope farmers don't meet the same fate.
I don't understand that point why farmers sell it to the middle man when MSP is higher than the market rate. I understand that only a few people get to sell through MSP because of the storage issue but I don't understand the other reason why they take those products to the market when the MSP is higher than the market rate.I assume that farmers don't have a clear idea of the rates that is prevailing?
"Punjab was divided in 47 with the majority hived off to PAK. Then in 66, we had the created of Haryana/Himachal. "
Finally BJP learnt few things from Congress...
All farmers have gone from delhi to UP suddenly to register their protest as there is poll coming in UP soon 
"Those who are supporting Owaisi ,you are nothing better than bhakts ,one side u guys are opposing Bjp because of communalism and other side support Owaisi ,lol how hypocrite u guys are ..."
"If government had done it 12 month ago, 500 more farmers would be alive "
Godi Media may not cover this story
What do u mean by withdrawing support from bill? Withdraw support to government.
BJP didnt wanted to repeat the West Bengal performance in UP so better he took this decision immediately to atleast give a fight in UP election.
We should support farm law
Stupid decision.. India's dream of reforming it's agriculture has failed ab yahi kisan sadko par ayenge! Aur kahinge ki hamara karz maaf kar do! Taxpayers kr paise se farmers ko subsidy di jayegi! Welcome back to Nehruvian Socialism!
Now who will return those farmers lives whome ur people killed?
"Guys, if these farmer bill are sooooo bad, why are only 2 states involved in this, why not the other millions of farmers in India?"
"Also, this agitation is ignited by land owners(large tracts of land of Dalits, the oppressed community was grabbed during Khalistan movement), not the cultivators and workers who actually who work in farms and are treated in subhuman ecosystem"
"Highly appreciate your work. Thank you for giving clarity about this. Otherwise, Godi media has gone to next level."
"These were seperatists the clip if nishad.. there is exclusively mention of ""sikhon ko maarne k liye"" not ""farmers"".. "

Against the farm bill
"No ethics..... Support for farmer's.... without them we are nothing..........shame on Modi government.......This is what ""Achhe din aane waale hain'???????? Godi media...."
"So how does that connect to repealing farm laws?  Look, someone was willing to pump in around 50 to 100 million US dollars in this farmers agitation. This is ballpark estimate. You can work out yours."
KISSAN AKTA JINDABAD  SPESAL THANKS BBC NEWS CHANNEL DA JIS NA ASLI KISSAN ANDOLAN BARA WORLD NU DASYA  godi media de reess ne kite  THANKS BBC
"However much eye witnesses you bring, I don't think justice will prevail. The case will go on for years and finally the accused will get bail. This is our lovely and great india under siege by modi and amit shah."
Don't support farmers
"The farmers should invest in. Futuristic technology, alternative toppings or seeds."
"Good explanation, thanks.  It seems that the farmers have found effective ways to impact the country in a way that makes them hard to ignore. May the greed driven encroachments be turned back before they further harm these vulnerable farmers."
"Sorry for asking, but wouldn't this situation be resolved if the government just introduced new minimum price laws for the produce of the farmers and enforce them? That way the three farm laws would be acceptable, the system would rid off middlemen and both the farmers and the government would get what they want. Again, apologies for my naivete regarding the issue, just wanting to understand the situation better."
"Every body is criticising the laws,  no body is proposed the better guidelines to benefit farmers"
Congress Ke sajis Hai - 200 Farmers Sit on protest .
"According to pradhan sevak n hagna runout there are no issues in farm bills...farmers have been misled,so are the doctors who are now called as urban naxals "
"Just trash the bills and start working with the farmers ! Why is the Govt so focused in imposing those bills? When the farmers are protesting and saying they don't need it??  Those bills were not discussed properly and were made as law. What nonsense was that ? That's the same happening with every BJP reform which is destroying country""s economy & unity. And after the poor farmers started agitation now the Govt is suggesting ammendmends to the bills. So where is the trust and what were the Govt motives  imposing those bills in the first place?? Just trash those bills first and then talk. Why is the Govt not putting on the listening ears ? This govt is supposed to be for the people right ? I guess its not yet dictatorship here  TRASH the BILLS !!"
I can understand when they say son of a farmer as am one !
Police should have some shame getting paid by the tax payer and still beating Farmers who produce food.
 Farmers don't need degree for it.
"Please show the whole video , when that is running over the farmers"
Best of luck all farmers for your future.. 
Je baat... Ye hai real farmer..
Taliban dont touch India for read the word of god dont steer your army god soldiers in harm way listen to your lord god amen
It's disappointing that the reformist law's have been repealed.Hope this are implemented in at least Bjp ruled states.
What you call them i my opinion there not farmer
Whenever a person(farmer or govt/private employers) takes a loan he estimates that he can pay the installments but  sometimes someone in his family gets contracted with some disease his whole money or property  gets used because of lack of good fair price hospitals.
This cleared everything about Farm Bills! Much grateful to you for this.
We support farmers 
Essential supplying to farmers is good job but when water was not supplied in Delhi till 15 days then where had AAP party
"2nd law: Suppose if there is heavy rain (or any other natural disaster)  and the quality of the crops are not that good, then sponsors (companies) can refuse to take corps. And even these companies will ask the money back from farmers which they provided for cultivation and this cycle will make a farmer slave of these companies. If a sponsored company will bankrupt in future and other company refused to take that crop then what a farmer will do. And famers are not allow to go to court. "
"The food donor you are calling a terrorist is yours next time. It's time, if you can't support, don't protest because the farmer is fighting not only his own battle but also yours."
heart breaks to see how farmers are forced to live in such cold weather but for them the pain caused by  those farmer laws is more..
What are your suggestions on Farm bills and Agri reforms? Comment below!
Bastered India today's team.only 4 farmers are killed by jeep and other 4 killed by farmers of jeep passengers 
"It was PDP, NC & congress which supported them not taken any action. "
" Their demands for recognition of MSP as statutory right, whittling down of the The Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance 2020 and withdrawal of cases on farmers seems unreasonable and naive for following reasons-"
"indian national media shame on you ,"
"If you want to stay poor, not Modi, even god cannot help. Let the farmers decide their fate now. Getting carried away with fools is the best solution for them as of now, but they'll repent for their unethical mindset and behaviour later in future."
Government should clear to farmar's about this bill.
