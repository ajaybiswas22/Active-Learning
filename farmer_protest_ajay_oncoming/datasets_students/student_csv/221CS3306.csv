"The laws weren't benefiting anyone for they weren't in force. BJP was being unable to make inroads into the protests which had turned a Sihk vs BJP protests, Punjab and the Sikh community was getting alienated day by day, there was no assurance if the laws would be ever in force. All in all, the entire situation was breeding only negatives for IND and there was absolutely no positives. Add to that, all organisations and individuals who were in support of the laws, they had passed the entire buck to the GOI, and GOI was visibly struggling under it's load."
3. I do agree that there will be an increased intervention by private players in the farm produce sector however at every point the farmer is the decision making authority wether they wanna deal at APMC mandis or Direct to buyer and wether they wanna get into a finite contract with a private buyer or they wish to sell their produce as they have been doing all this while. 
Alll credit goes to our farmers 
"SHAMELESS congressmen, congresswomen, congressees, etc....... I *VOW, SWEAR, take OATH to NEVER EVER* vote to congressmen, congresswomen, congressees, their direct and/or indirect associates and/or allies and/or supporters, etc........ whatsoever"
3. Why having APMC since 1965 still ensures only 6% of farmers are getting MSP??
Why the Indian police force use water cannon and tear gas on peaceful protests? The farmers dont have weapons...This is so brutal...
If the farm laws are bad why did they framed why it is in manufesto of cong bjp aap
I am a son of a farmer in Punjab. Ilove my India like all the farmers. These news channel will not say anything wrong about govrenment. If you wanna see rality you can watch NDTV India or you see Dhruv Rathi s latest video. Please dont judge farmers protest according to these fake news. Please
I didn't like SG version. U actually justifying entire episode by proving it's government mistake but actually entire incidence is not good for Indian farmers and for us as a nation. Most of bold decisions are made with iron fist and eventually people fall in line.
Modhi is right on this one by curtting welfare from farmers.
The best thing in this protest Haryana wale & punjab wale unite together .this is our culture we live together & stay together jai jawan jai kisan
who all want a India Media vs Savage Trevor Noah
"Lastly MSP: You the reader needs to understand that it should be the minimum base price that the farmer should get not the maximum. And even if you don't like MSP atleast ask your MLA that why products bought under MSP prices ,the savings aren't passed on to you. Maybe we need a MSP proce on each product instead Of MRP to show how much the traders are making on these goods. "
Modi and yogi has become general dayer of independent india
He brought issue like farming in main stream. Addressed many problem faced by Bangladeshi farmers. 
"Absolutely fantastic, Explained in a simple and lucid manner. Clearly shows vested interests are opposing the new farm bills. I hope good sense prevails."
"Do u all know, govt. Openly requested farmers to come and discuss, which line in farm law they think is bad, govt will remove it."
"Regarding, the court settlement of disputes, do they want to drag these honest, poor and innocent farmers to the web of lengthy, expensive, cumbersome legal procedures of Indian judicial system???. Nowadays, it is taking more time to get a dispute redressal in a reasonable manner. You must also note that most of SDM's are young IAS recruits who entered the system with the utmost vigour, competence and ardent devotion to doing good for the society. You should also note that the workload of a local judge is more than the same as an SDM. Of course, no system is perfect and blemishes-free. Even if a farmer is allowed the option to approach the court, there is no guarantee he/she will get a suitable redressal because of the widespread corruption in the Indian legal system. So, I suggest each and every one approach the issue in a more open and unbiased manner. We cannot allow our emotions to rule over the visible facts, figures and realities. I know I am not that educated but I always try to approach an issue in an honest way without any prejudices."
"Thank you for your video. Furthermore, these 3 Bills of Law will simply remove the 1 to 1 relationship farmers have with their buyers, create mass unemployment in already poor rural areas and furthermore leave the farmers to the mercy person to big corporations.  These new laws remove the courts, federal state and larger governments legal capacity to support farmers during contract disputes and moves this in to the hands of bureaucratic officers  so we should ask is corruption still an issue in India??? The current 'Mandi' and Arhtiyas system provides a number of other key services to farmers, they provide small low-rate loans, labour, network farmers together and provide assistance to farmers when they are struggling. It is also worth noting that farmers are small businesses and if you ask any business owner, cash flow is the heart of any successful business, as many unexpected costs can often arise. These laws will erode a current credit system and no private company will not replace this  and why should they? If farmers in one bad year; are at the mercy of corporations, have no access to credit and state intervention or legal recourse they will be forced to sell their land to respond to a short-term problem when they arise. Once they sell their land, they sell the only asset that they may own. In fact, in every western country it is well known a persons earnings only contribute to 25% of their lifetime wealth, whereas 75% wealth is attributed to what they own (asset value) and land is an asset that grows in price. This has happened repeatedly to farmers in times of recession when markets are manipulated by inflation and deflation of markets. Anyhow, today farmers in Europe have much more advanced Mandi and Arhtiyas type of system which is known as the cooperative farming - which provide these necessary support services that farmers need. Bihar farmers have already gone through something similar and lack an agriculture credit system  is crippling their farmers. Keep the current system its is something that India should be proud of and it should be expanded throughout Hindustan. Jai Hind!"
Shame on indian media
"MSP procurement happens in 23 States for paddy and 12 States for Wheat and It is the ignorance of Tikait and his paid leaders. In other commodities marketable surplus is not there. SKM is not demanding inclusion of Maize. (in Bihar & MP), Jowar (MH), Bajra (Rajasthan), Mandua (Uttrakahand) in PDS system bcoz it will affect the procurement of wheat and paddy in Haryana and Punjab."
"I find it absolutely ridiculous that tv anchors spinning it like Modi is the hero behind the farm laws repeal. They should be ashamed that they are giving the credit to Modi instead of the farmers  who have been protesting on the streets for more then a year, it's a blood shame, I come to hate Modi and his bunch of sycophant more and more everyday,"
"2. Within 4,5 years they take monopoly over agriculture due to Contract farming Law. APMC's will gradually disappear. "
Bjp isnow so good at ignoring problems in the country that they don't even see farmers walking on the street.
It was only hope for small farmers.
I am happy ..for it... Thanks for supporting Farmers..l love basic gyan
He never spoke during farmer protest and today he is speaking. Dal mein kuch kala hai
Ravish is the real Iron man of New India!!
The  farmers wanted to utilize  the difficult CORONA situation in  India. It is not justifiable.
"the graphics are confusing. and I wonder how the landlords fit into this picture - as I understand it, most farmers pay rent for use of their land."
"Well done to the farmers, the government should represent the people from the land and not pressures from outside or within (businesses) its money to them but its your home and thats not preplacable!"
"Corrupt Govt need to stop this scam of Buying votes on the name of sending Farmers 2000rupee every 3 month, instead make MSP as law so farmers get their cost, make MW ( minimum wage ) law so general labour working in cities and metro cities in construction, renovations, cleaning , Gardners and servants and maids for rich and ultra rich & above middle Class"
The major concern is the silent farmers from other states who were in favour of these laws and against these so called farmers agitations... In India the corrupt political and dishonest people are doing everything to destabilise the government but this is not the problem.. The real problem is the majority silent spectators who are unable to raise their voices against dishonesty... The only maximum tool to show their concern is social media messages...
But we need to educate the farmers with this laws.
Thank you for raising the farmers issue.
" I am also the son of a farmer, so this pain is our own, if the farmer is not happy then it will be difficult to feed the whole world, first he committed many suicides, some debts were buried, he appealed to the state government  Oppose the decisions and understand the pain of their farmers and speak for their rights.  The media should also emphasize this.  Most of the farmers make a living by cultivating on a small plot of land, do not deprive them of their rights and oppose the decision of the government and so I request everyone that this uf"
BJP goons has  cross the limit. Please everyone who loves their Dharti Mata stand against the corrupts leaders and make India beautiful.

"Great job guys. As an English speaking farmer, I want to salute your positive journalism. "
"This is all for the coming elections. Farmers still don't forget all those hardships, all those people who died due to this, all those people who are brutally murdered by running over vehicle on them. we have to vote that Fraud out and drag every Godi media  to court who tried to defame the farmers, mothers and country. Or else this will never end."
Now the time has come for Pakistan and taliban.  Let's wait and see how they play their games
No support to broker middleman mandi walas
@ 3:22 It is not called Kamataka its called Karnataka for a second you had me worried that did India get another state which I did not learn about.  One more thing I haven't seen another video from Vox when there was farmers protest back in 2017 was it because it was from a different part of India ?  It is very difficult to gauge which protests and videos are politically motivated and which are not.
"Dictatorship shown by BJP ruled states, Digging well built Roads to setup barricades using stones, Dirt and vehicles, what a shameful act by Modi Govt."
I have done my LLB in Germany. You explained everything very well but there are farmers who keep protesting in Germany because there is no MSP. Farmers are being pressurized by private sector as there is no MSP. Farmers are getting the lowest rate. There should be a MSP on every product
"Hence, these must be repealed, the government agreed to amend 90% of the bill which means that they are wrong so why are they enforced?"
"There is one pitfall which has not been addressed. When a big company enters into an agreement with small entity, the company dictates the terms. The small entity ends up being exploited. Perhaps enough has not been done to safeguard the interests of farmer ."
Its a shame that some media outlets see this as a victory
Jai kisan .....salute all farmers and you tube media anchor
"When they were brutally killing that guy, suddenly the camera shifted, these fake farmers need to be taught a lesson"
BJP/RSS  have the same Ideology of Taliban. 
This is one of the best videos I have seen about farm bills.
Democracy win ....farmers win
