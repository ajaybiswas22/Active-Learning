#SupremeCourtStand4Farmers
"There are so many reforms, bills, pensions, loan waivers, apps for the farmers but what they don't have is awareness about them."
I fully support this decision farmers know what is good or bad for them jai kisan
"If this laws had come during congress period, Modi supporters would have been protesting instead of farmers"
Modi chore. Basted . We will see congress will come
"Leave the farmers alone they never asked for this bill, Modi government is trying to make business men rich corporations rich he doesnt care about the common man. Jai Kisaan Jai Jawan."
"Lands from them . This two way work is functional in many developed countries. If you think you are educated then first have a research on this then mark your opinion because your opinion can change someone else. And tell me why only 6% farmers are against of it the reason is that they are wealthier section of farmers who do not need any change but farmers of jharkhand Bihar like States need new ways .Now our India is at a verge of development in all over world , we are becoming global leaders so some anti national elements are working to change this government anyhow by hook or by crook."
Modi and cabinets ministers wanted more shares from those working hard decent living Indian farmers! Shame!
"Yogendra Yadav says that farmers are already allowed to sell products to private traders. They also showed the fact that 94% of farmers are already selling their products to private traders. Now, how come all of sudden the data will be gone? I think that is a BS argument."
"LMAO. Now Punjab is open for the BJP. And Congress doesn't have material, surprised Pikachu faces.."
Forget about losing the battle!! Modi and Shah haven't even begun to play their game. And I'm saying this when I'm a congress supporter. I know what they can do!!
"i guess they will leaves their job as protest , to farm laws repeal."
3. MSP is the life line for farmers when the price goes down below the cost of production. Of course nothing has been done to it.
Farmers done a great job
Good too good students support farmers protest.
There is some sort of politics going around in the leaders of SKM as well ... i am not saying all of them but some of them for sure. I. Have one question too? When people were marching to delhi from punjab and haryana barricades were broken and farmers were attacked and barricades have been broken in delhi on 26 .. so how come breaking barricades become such a huge issue when previously it was not. Clashes were there before too... Singhu border tikri border are not a home of farmers.
Let me just tell u that all these laws are already there in Western countries  ... Though we support our farmers but laws have both good n bad and good are more than bad... No one can predict future but currently they seem beneficial
"Indians remember one thing if farmer will collapse, whole civilization will collapse"
Farmers in this country have got many loan waivers but then also they aren't able to meet their needs .
In Punjab and Haryana Mandi system works well  But in south India its worst
Sir I am CDS aspirant but my father is a farmer in UP. This video help me in SSB.
"13:09 background singing is so on point. The amount of unity among Sikhs, and farmers in general, absolutely heart-melting. So true that Modi is always tweeting about USA and other nations and hasn't cared even once about our farmers. Always running after money be it PM cares fund or Adani and now these farm laws which will help the private companies again and get this government more money in their pockets. 60-70 Sikh died while protesting, 50+ days already. Shameless government. Thank you ScoopWhoop for getting us this content. I changed the bell icon to all notifications. You guys should start Patreon too. I would love to support you guys."
BJP can only be defeated when Rahul Gandhi resign from Congress top post.    
Despite that some more percentage of farmer be benefited from Gov procurement. The value a seller gets in his relationship with the buyer depends upon whether the seller has an alternative option. Otherwise the buyer exploits his monopoly power.
"And if don't know, I let you know that out of 37 states and union territories only farmers of 2-4 states are protesting against this..."
Small farmers' interests subdued by rich farmers for their own interests.
Indian Government myst roll back new 3 laws if there is so much agitation
So gov compromised for few states. Disregarding rest of states.. in from south and i am a farmer. This is really sad. We were happy that there will be reforms . . politics failed farmers again.
Our country needs a honest government and the one who is willing to listen and understands farmers
By heart I am thankful to lallontop channel to standing for farmers  (truth).
Now farmers of India  will be able contribute % in GDP
but dhruv ;these city ppl do not understand our farmers problem;media plays a very dirty role
He never spoke on farmers in period before today. Print is no rebel independent media instead it is a digital extension of godi media.
Good decision by govt. Not compare it caa or 370 it's for Indians farmers
"This might go down in history as your Stalingrad mr modi. A bill for which you and your entire party were vigorously campaigning for past 1 year, u withdrew it and backstabbed all the people who believed in you. Kahan gayee apki 56 inch ki chhati? Aise desh nahin chalte, tikait jaise dakait ko national leader banane ke liye aapko bohot bohot badhai"
"It is a drama, after the symbolic agitation of BKS, the Modi govt will agree on framers issue and it will be circulated that it is because of RSS and which will minimise the electral damage of BJP in upcoming UP election."
"How come the manifesto of all major political parties had the somewhat same kind of farm reform laws in even 2019. I guess, different government committees in past 20 years studied this matter and also suggested about farms reform. Even Rakesh Tikait at first praised the reform and later dissociated from it. In fact, Print reported that Kaushik Basu also had same kind of suggestion to congress but when the laws came through NDA he started to come up with different problems in this law. Definitely, the failure of demonetization made PM weak as he cant say now that whatever decision he takes will reap good.  So, he failed to push hard for these reforms as the credibility already questioned on one major reform i.e. notebandi."
Another Masterstroke by Modi As per Andhbhakts n Godi Media.
I want an overview on the topic of the ongoing protest of farmers 2020 to 2021 ..Within tommrow
Many tractors no registration plate. Carring weapons.kalistani flag. 40 lakh worth modified tractor was seen. Rich people
The only tv channel NDTV help and support farmers and even farmer respect them 
Even our media is fucked up. Putting pressure on farmers by making nonsense Alligaitons
If democracy ko bachana then farmers ki support kro sabb
"Farmers are really hardworking, very strong and powerful. I hope they bring the change."
"Just one thing to mention here, as you said there should be one intermediary between company & farmers. what are the chances that the intermediary will not treat farmers as traders are doing?"
This was a super attempt to demistify the complex fam bills and it's impact both on us as well as the farmers. Very well done.
"Respected Ravish sir, I know it's hard time for you as a real journalist but things will change soon God willingly and you also know that people are with you cause you are good man and Love our beautiful country India & it's democracy. "
"Shekharji.  You have overlooked the real lesson we have learnt from this unfortunate episode. It is that money raised by vested interests and shared with religious entities can be more powerful than the will  of the people expressed electorally. But for the nexus between the middlemen in Punjab and the Gurdwaras, the financial support could not have mobilized to oppose the laws through protests on the ground.This is a dangerous development and the country should be alerted to this by journalists like you."
"Punjab and Haryana farmers got succeeded in their agenda, now the farmers from other state can't compete with them and became as much rich as they are, because of just 2-3 states now whole india is suffering."
Hi SO absolutely zee hindustan live news around the world
"My dear first you understand bill properly ""contract with farms means making live licences agreement contract with kisan on his land by private company's. Forexp: if company want tomato farmers has to grow tomatos only on his land and what ever price has has decided in agreement any how kisan has to sale to company at that price even if he gets good price in mandi he cant sale his products with anybody else. Even if gov says this clause is not on land its on ""fashal"" which is grown by kisan vice versa it means the same. Any how if kisan gets 5% advantage with this bill clause there is 95% of losses plz focuse on that. British time companies also used to do same thing. "
"Well, to shorten the case, the laws of mandi will remain intact. The new laws are for something outside the mandis. If farmers are skilled enough to produce quality food, then instead of minimum selling price(MSP), they can sell it to corporates or restaurants through contracts like those done in commodity markets. And the new laws are putting these corporates and restaurants or any other bidder to pay the farmers and obey the contract. So these laws are just another option, and that doesn't banish the mandis option."
Farmers aage bado ham tumhare sath h 
Well I support for farmers but a flag agnist indian flag is completely different thing
