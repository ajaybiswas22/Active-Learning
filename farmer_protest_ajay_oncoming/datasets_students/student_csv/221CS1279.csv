"MP, UP & RAJASTHAN are also joining PUNJAB &  HARYANA. Punjab started it and they all gonna end it up. "
"Nothing MSP- in Farmers bills? Outside APMC , its not necessary- its not (deliberately) mentioned."
Election is coming  ye toh hona hi tha they are losing but sad so many farmers died coz of him. Farmers should wait before doing anything because we can't trust feku on this.
"Russia,China,Pakistan officially Taliban ko support kar diya.."
Government should take care of farmers
I honestly feel farmers were mislead ..mostly genuinely protesters were middle men which are so much in Punjab...though on front it looks farmers didn't want it..so good Modi roll them back..I hope they come up with other reforms..by yes we need reforms..
i kno wire would have got more ppl supported the bill but as usual wire show only those ppl who are against the gov
Don't  provoke  us our  blood  is  up  .MODI ji  speaks  universal  truth
Haryana and Punjab have better AMPC system then other states
Don't worry .. this is a strategy to find out people in nvilved in Khalistan from inside India. Now they are tracked . Try to understand the depth
They are not farmer
States are losing revenue...why farmers are revolting
Salute to each and every individual of this country who has stands with our farmers for their solidarity agitation
"This doesnt even cover the protests themselves, which are maligned by the government and the national media. Mispotrayed as insurrectionists, when they arent even asking for that. Then they say its only two states, when that is far from the truth. People have been beaten as far as rajasthan and bihar and stymied from participating. The local police themselves cause agitations, and then use that excuse to perform extrajudicial kidnappings/torture. The mass population who watch national media, get an alternate reality."
"Its in farmers hand how and where and when they want to see. Till they dont come into any agreement with the private organisation regarding their growing of vegetations. They can sell according to themselves if they are free from any binding. Its on farmers if they want to sell to any government bodies or anywhere in net. Farmers should decide completely in their moves. If according to the new bill they want to sell their product in any private organisations its on them. They can sell according to future rates or according to present rates thats should depend on them totally. Every profits gain should go to them. A government body should be formed which can look after the private mandis trade. There should be a government and 2 parties understanding where it should be memtioned about their future activities. The body should be given complete freedom to support and help the farmers and protect their gain or interests of anyway. It should be a clear transparency where state and central government should be earning by taxes and other means both in sarkari mandis or private. So government have to come into 2 job, thats providing safety and security and protection of farmers interests of anytype plus 2ndly to gain taxes in the mandis. It requires few clarification and changes in the law and the farmers can improve their vegetation and produce more keeping workers and labourers under them."
Plzzz stay with the farmers...
"He is saying ""Punjab ke badde kissan the"",  Most of these farmers owns less 5 acres of land."
Modi u will pay for dis poor farmer so sad fr dem
Give example of bihar where this type law was made in 2006 and how has been bihar farmers are now destroyed
"Traditionally  much of the APMC stalls are owned by  members of a particular community ,thanks to the pseudo secular regimes of islamic congress.  This is the main reason for the heartburn.  Farmers are easy to manipulate and cartelisation of commission agents in APMC is very easy bcz most members belong to a particular community."
"When we looked, we found that only Punjab & Haryana farmers agitation is going on against farm bill. But South Indian farmers are totally silent, WHY? anybody having answer?"
"First of all, the mandi system is the reason why our farmers have suffered all these years. Contract Farming provides farmers with all the necessary  items required. The farmer receives high quality seeds from the company, moreover, a farmer can decide to break the contract at any given time. Even, before these bills were passed, PepsiCo had entered into agreements with several farmers in Punjab. No farmer had any problem with the private contractor. This new system provides farmers with a wide range of market price. Regarding, the essential co.modities bill, the initial act was brought in when the country had a deficiency of resources. Today, thanks to the Green revolution, India produces more than the sufficient requirement. This bill was previously preventing companies from purchasing goods in excess from the farmers to store it. The amendment changes that. Please don't spread fear among the people like this."
"over the price prevailing immediately preceding twelve months, or average retail"
Finally our Legend Farmers Won 
I am not a farmer even I have agriculture land and supporter of Kisan Morcha from the beginning. I suggest you to open Toll Plaza as it must effect the development of Punjab in future. It is my humble request only.
It's a straight forward thing that if the law is made for farmers and they donot it is much sensible to take those laws back.
Happy independence day To India..... ...   from Taliban of Afghanistan
"May be you want welfare of India but you can't ignore Indian citizens...We are still striving for food and job .,kindly provide these.. we are not in Wonderland that your animated jumlas will help us..we are in India and we still striving for survival..Msg to BJP"
Ratkesh tiket bhawisyafal    up election 2022   .....00  seats
"This is the real picture  of profit and loss of three bills brought by the govt for the welfare of  farmers. No doubt  these three bills  are against of middle  men of mandies,who were going rich to rich and kissan were going  poor to poor."
World great leader Modi Ji
Modi cares for his poll victory MORE than anything else on earth !
BJP come again up cm yogi ji Jay shri Ram
"Salute Lallantop for showing Truth, No Farmer No Food "
Could you please explain the reasons why farmers are protesting in another video
For India farmers!! Fight for your right and freedom!!
"It's not Kisaan Andolan.. It's sign of One more possible partition of India. Khalistan... Govt. Of India should strictly take actions against these activities. It's crime against Nation, Security and Integrity of India. Farmer engage in his work not in Such activities. This movement is run by Nakli Kisaan"
Already farmers can sell their produce to anyone they want instead of going to mandi. What this bill does is just making sure the buyers are protected from future litigation and remove the stocking limitation of the buyers which will impact the both the end buyers and farmers.
If Modi n Shah think they can use this violence as an excuse to crush the farmers protests by using their old tactics then they again will be doing a grave mistake. They should give what farmers have been requesting.
Bjp wala smjh gya tha mere promoter and supporter follower km pdne laga to apna kanoon wapas lena pda
"I hope sincerely, that government listens to them in peaceful contact...and pray my farmer brothers to be patient and protest unless they are listened to, which I believe they will be listened to, they don't have other choice..."
Haryana muncipal polls will decide if Farmer laws are designed to benefit BJP or farmers.
you obviously arent punjabi and have been watching too many bollywood movies and dont know ground reality.I can see there are lot of Modi Bhakats here. Only suggestion I have for them
"We lack terribly in holding fort ourselves, in protecting family, friends, neighborhood, state, nation and the worlds sanctity. Lack of inclusion of culture and ethics in our teachings, under the guise of secularism, this allows us to easily fall prey to any sort of lure and we in turn try to find appeasement in search of alternatives in looking for luxury and laze. Each child needs a healthy and strong mind, the lure of wealth need not move him/her. The best way a child learns, I hear is by aping. So the owness falls on the shoulders if the parents, which means that parents have to follow the path if righteousness. This is easy to say, i am aware. We have to stop fraudulent and easy lifestyle and stop falling prey to all sorts of appeasement. It's difficult but let's all pledge to begin. One Modi cannot bring about the much required change, we need to be good civilians, administrators, strong and upright armed forces, judiciary, all and sundry. Ready to lay our lives if required not only on our borders but also in our homes, neighborhoods, states and nations. With a target of a 'Vasudeva kutumbakam'. Don't you think that the little youtubers were already warning us of groups of people wanting to be and remain rich by controllingthe masses. We can already see our weak Indian structure easily falling down around us everyday. Not one desh bhakt was found ready to lay his life, without a thought of the consequences and not let any other flag be raized on the Lal Kila an Indian monument on Indian land. Shame on us Indians."
Shame on india govt and bjp ministers
Great result for the resolve of our farmers. They are showing India the way. United we stand and we can bring the mighty down.
Shame on Indian government #istandwithfarmers
"If center government would have taken the laws back this would not have happened first of all.Secondly,this was done to malign the protest and put a black mark on the whole struggle the farmers are doing.The culprits should be arrested immediately."
"As a literature student I would like to add that the fears of our farmers are part of the traditional folklore/folk-belief. If you look at folklore from any agricultural communities you find atleast one villain who is Seth/Zamindar/Sahukar extorting the poor farmer/peasant/laborer. This had amplified during the colonial era with horrific famines and almost 200% tax. So when nationalist movement invited farmers to join protest, it gained nationalist color as farmers from across the country came together. This narrative was recalled during Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan era and during various CPI movements in Bengal and Kerala. So it was only natural that when farmers were told that they will directly deal with buisnessmen, they panicked. Its almost the Krishna-Kans dichotomy."
Respect farmers Save farmers!!!
"Ravish & parkash are more than cnn, bbc indian pakistani media combined . . . Hats Off"
"Govt, at least now, could move on and focus on other sectors for economic growth.. Probably, a watered down version of this farm laws could be enacted in BJP ruled states or center might enact laws to strengthen and bring transparency to existing setup."
You are a true example Indian Farmers. Not only did you achieve this for which I am so happy for you But you have shown the rest of the world things are not hopeless! You give me strength!
"The demand Yadav is making is that penal provisions be included that, if anybody buys farm produce below MSP, he will be put to trial and punishment. In case it is done it is sure that the produces will rotten if there is oversupply in the market. Take the example of wheat. If oversupply is there for wheat (which can be easily produced), the excess produce will not be purchased by anybody due to fear of legal provisions. So the demand for penal provisions is utter foolishness. It will put especially small and medium farmers into more trouble."
"poor farmers lost, rich farmers won"
