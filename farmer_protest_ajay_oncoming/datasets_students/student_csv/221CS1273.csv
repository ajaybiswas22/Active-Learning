We are with them .Delhi walo come out of your house and support Farmers
"Okay so basically I support modi and i dont need to give you a reason , cuz its just politics yk"
ASEAN farmers should pay more attention to this... Our thoughts and prayer be with you farmers of india...
"Reason is very clear be it SC, ST or the farmers they're absolute power and vote bank."
We support farmers. But not Voilence. But still full support to brothers. Im from Haryana. We were there. Not in chaos. In peaceful rally.
*In case someone is wondering why farmers are protesting against fwg bills;*
I come from an India where NewsLaundry is an independent media
Now wait for all those godi supporters to call farmers Khalistani terrorists 
"only people who dont know the farm laws will go against them. the farm laws only benefit farmers by opening up grater opportunities for them so they are not at the hands of these middlemen who are protesting who buy crops from farmers at low cost and then sell it to  companies for a heavy price. now farmers will be able to sell produce to companies directly and get a greater profit....moreover, the people protesting are all the rich farmers . even at the protests they get trucks and fit tvs in them and enjoy....GOVERNMENT IS READY TO TALK TO FARMERS UNDERSTAND PROBLEMS TO MAKE CHANGES IN LAWS IF NECESSARY  BUT FARMERS  DONT WANT TO TALK AND DISCUSS AS THEY HAVE NO POINTS"
"If all the farmers decide to cut down production by 20% instead Protesting, they will make more money because of demand."
"I think the few points what you have missed were already highlighted in comment section. The main fact I'd like to put forth is that, ""In any which way, Farmers and Middle class will see ups/downs. The only reason we are seeing chaos out there is b'coz it's creating an impact on many Mediator groups which connects us (may it be Dealers, Mandi owners or State Govt. itself)."
"They called us ( farmers ) KHALISTANI that united entire India , without any caste creed or sex "
Congratulations to all Kishan n mazdoor.... Jo v morche de hak check c
"Only Mandi Mafia protesting, if it is bad to farmers? Why not all over the india farmers are not protesting?"
Breaking Bharat forces in action. Do you need any more evidence? Time to unite and support BJP even more.
APMC fullform is AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE MARKETING COMMITTEE sir.... NOT AGRICULTURE PRICE sir ... but its ok...it happens 
Thank you lallantop . And shame on godi media
Zee media shame on you kitne talve chatoge
i belong to a farmer's family and i support farmers but not khalistanis
I am also kishan .but we with BJP.
Govt. ignored  when hundreds of farmers lost their lives but when elections approach they  kick started election propaganda by this step
Prime minister has to sit with gurnam face to face. Without that farmers will not go back. Parliament sessions behind scene will not work.
God: Farmers do so from the produce of the fields.
We hats off to the farmers
Good work by farmer
"The talk between farmers and government is not crossing The line of ifs , buts , therefore , although , since and ultimately both of us sleep on farm bill using it as pillow for two years , if any solution comes in our dream Will be Okay ! Such is the conclusion of last meeting as laymen can understands ?"
"Chuslami media, don't show very big issues like (Kishan Bharwad )who killed by islamist over a post, don't u people have any morality."
Pakistan. Or  taliban  ka Hindustan par. Qabza.. ho gaa bohat jaldee....Bollywood janta or Bollywood indian armey...stupid PM...google report....a tea man
"If we had done this once in India in the 60s with Rice and Wheat, why not this time with other produce and then gradually bring in the farm laws."
Amending APMC ( Agricultural Produce Market Committee ) Act doest mean These Black Farm Laws.... AAP never Said It WIll Bring These Kind of Laws...  Doont Misguide People For Views And Money.
"India needs Good Leaders, same goes for delhi police. Jab tum farmers ko nhi smja pa rhe to China to dur ki baat h. Really weak leadership on display yr, its been more than 6 months now. Embarrassing for the reputation."
"I Demand Bharat ratna for rakesh sir,the way he is fighting for the rights of 70% farmer population if India "
Zee news official spokesperson of BJP
Farmers are more important then Modi
Farm bills are not at all good for farmers ! On such a platform you should have better knowledge
"Development means more jobs, high salaries, low utility costs, low taxes, affordable health care, high quality education and large number of growth opportunities. Justice based governance means nobody can misuse power. Self-respect and inner strength means always standing with the right no matter who is against you. It doesn't matter you die rich or poor but make sure you die with self-respect. For that to happen ask government about development and knock it down if justice isn't served. Farmers are doing the right thing and Modi is one of the biggest scam."
Roudys on roads no farmers.
"22:00 lets assume 10 years down the line, everything turns out as planned, corporates enter the agricultural market, farmers are getting higher prices, there are private mandis all over the country. How will the Indian govt honour its commitment to NFSA. Will it be buying from the corporates. I am sure they will sells the grains to Indian govt at subsidised rates just because those grains are to be distributed among poor"
All india support you ravish Kumar   NDTV
Thanks to Sir Chhotu Ram who made Mandi act for United Punjab
In news walo ko kya pta kisan ka... Agle janam m inhe bhi Jat banana...tb pta chalega! Rab mehar kare! This is Modi's international bezzti. Now the world will know what this fascist is doing!
"Guy's they are not a farmer's are they are just a political game in this game the innocent public are getting hard jago chutiya public modi ji ki jay modi ha tho moumkin ha you ful hopeless public kab jagoga sab app logo ka dam pa kar raha ha sarkar tho da rahi ha lakin ya chor sala sab kha latha ha jagoo fir sa bol rahahu jago public or bhi kisaan ha is desh may aram sa  ha jago,jay hind jay bharat"
 Farmers protest in this case.
"Media channels here in Kerala showed great support to the farmers and celebrated the victory...Newspapers like Hindu held actual facts too. ""The farmers really deserved support""."
"Ha, Corporatization of agriculture mai farmer ko exploit kiya jaa sakta h."
I was literally crying when you clarify about 'nishaan sahib'....I am sikh and I am also not happy when nishan sahib was hoisted on red fort....but 'taali sirf ik hath se nahi bajti'. Iwill always support farmers....kisaan ekta zindabad
Thank you for telling their stories. Keep fighting farmers from India 
We all indian are stands with our brave farmers
Boooohot der kar di ....janaab ...aate aate ..! Hundreds (7!?)  of farmers have lost their lives in the agitation ..!
"SG, I think the media has failed in its duty as the fourth estate. The media should have communicated the benefits of the farms laws - instead it was more interested in presenting a showdown between the farmers and the government."
"You Sir are learned and know very well the irrigation demand of rice and wheat. If you artificially keep the prices of these commodities high, the repercussions will be felt in the coming years. High prices of these commodities will act as a deterrent for the farmers to rotate the crop cycle and you very well know sir how thirsty paddy and wheat crops are. It not only endangers our economy but also the ecosystem."
"Real farmers (not the wolves in the sheepskin ) enjoyed,reaped the benefits of the 3 farm laws for nearly a year....."
16k  such people watched the video who are not dependent on farmers for their food
There is no corruption in Punjab and haryana against farmers....
Who is responsible for deaths of 700 farmers????
