"The Print you will grow and grow but if you stop your leftist bias, Talk only on facts, No support to left wing or right wings, I like this video even you all can see the views on the last video on Farm bills, they are lot more than views on any other video"
"Instead of sitting in a open space, let them sit peacefully in a room counting the bars in a jail.  Apt place for these fake farmer leaders."
45%congress+45 % AAP+10%extremists= 100%farmers Andolan
Governmundlinguistic error. But still cute but as always my full support to farmers. Aap sab bole to hum sare nojawan bhagat singh banne ko tayaar hai
"He killed innocent farmers and many innocent people,look at his villiany,understand his manipulation."
Fed up of these farmers.
If these people are farmers then I'm an astronaut
 God pardon me for voting BJP in previous elections on the promise of Badal Dal. 
Thoda economics padhiye please. Farmers are operating in Perfect Competition. They are price takers. They need huge investment for thier growth. 
Indian government in defaming farmers
"How could you do this arnab? Even you know prime minister loose this match with farmers. , Better prime minister put 3 masks when he is going to election campaign."
Most shameful day In a nation of farmers
I don't understand why farmers let Ashish Mishra go from that place and why did they beat his driver and other people only. Itni bheed me usko akeleko jane kyo diya baki sabko peeta to?
"@5:40 The aartiya middlemen might be good people in Punjab, where farmers have substantial awareness, unity and financial stability (86% farmers in India hold land below 1 Hectare, but avg land held by per farmer in Punjab is 3.62 Hectares!) Its difficult to exploit them. BUT that's not the case in other states. Where poor farmers farmers having less than 1 Hectare often get exploited by middlemen."
wow... i salute the courage of the farmers
Credit of high income of Punjab and Haryana is not because of the efficiency of current structure. That is because of the concentration of centre aid to farmers in these two states and Bihar on the other hand hand has very small land holdings...small and marginal farmers are vulnerable in Punjab and Haryana also only middle man benefit from the existing system and they are acting as pressure group to stop the reforms.
"While the farmers might have won the battle, India lost the war. This ensures India stays an agricultural society for decades to come."
"....... unfortunately, our IAS officials and some political leaders also who prepare such attractive blueprints of so called reform bills have no idea of poverty, lack of resources, want of education,  want of computer internet technology, lack of logistics & paper/documents works with our Indian farmers, therefore, our Indian farmers ( unlike American farmers) are not at the requisite threshold of managing /marketing of their produce by themselves .... inevitably, under the circumstances our agro-marketting is successful as totally dependent on our Govt agencies ( existing system of Mandikaran);  however, in implemnting the so called new reform bills would be distrous as it will open all possible corrupt avenues for the private traders/middlemenn with all the wealth/perhaps even black money at their disposal who will rob the farmers and thereby kill the nation, because today, the Govt is able to have full control on procurement of the produce, and storage of  the surplus produce and its regulated distribution across the needy population of the country as well as regulating the exports and even free donation to the needy world, .... .... therefore, in India ( Unlike America as an example  discussed above in here) with these new so called reform bills of management of agro-produce it is definitely aimed at welcoming private/middlemen traders to buy and sell the produce which would definitely rob/deprive the farmers of profits and that would kill the nation as well, because our nation India/Bharat is comprised of smaller land holdings but by a huge population of small farmers who do not have the requisite threshhold to enable them to act/become private businessmen in managing/marketting their produce without middlemen ( either Govt agencies or private traders); our agro-marketting is surviving because of an intensive infrastructure  of procurement, storage, distribution in place with setting of price by the Govt, .... farmers feel secure with the Govt agencies in marketing aspects of their produce, while in case of private traders no one could secure our huge populace of small farmers with smaller holdings and small produce at respective individual farmer level .... only God will save the poor farmer and poor India .... as for as GDP is concerned if a major population of a nation ( farmers) are robbed ... then forget about GDP growth curves,called reform system system will be robbed by middlemenn instead; ...... i may be allowed to reemphasize / a repetition of a paragraph above in here, viz : "
As a son of farmer. I support farmer sitting in cold.god help u.
They are not Farmers they are gunde 
Big farmers are also partners in mandi (APMC)
"Secondly, if govt is allowing state govts to regulate private mandies then how will the make any difference to farmers, state govt are already controlling the APMCs and in your opinion they are not good for farmers"
What is the demand of these farmers?? Pehle yeh toh batao... bekar me time waste kar diya
I don't see any female farmer protesting. Feminism?
India must establish good relation with Taliban using their diplomatic skill to protect the Indian interest in and around Afghanistan.
Real question is all those in media who rallied behind Modiji will apologize as well or they'll simply shamelessly switch sides like they've always done? It is this godi media who has painted Modiji as invincible even though every few months China slices away a part of Arunachal. Unfortunately this PM attacks the weaker sections of the society but lacks a spine when it comes to China.
Every  punjabi  knows  what  is written in 3 page bill we have very  intelligent  person  in Indian  parliament  called Bhagwant mann  who explains every  clause  of the bill in detail
2. If any dispute allow us to go to court currently in these laws it's written whatever dispute if arises only farmers can go to SDM. 
Every Indians know what Modi motif are..
We are indian we are farmer
The farmers are adamant...not ready to come to a compromise..especially the farmers from Punjab....they are arrogant..basically they more rich than farmers from other states..
Take back the 3 farm laws. We support farmers.
"Tikat is a congress agent.  His task now is to defame every person who speaks against RAGA,  as Mr. Owaisi exposed impotency of rahul gandhi on several occasions, tikat calls mr. Owaisi as bjp agent.  Perhaps he himself is a congRSS pittu.  His barking won't impact the popularly of Mr. Owaisi."
Kya ghinoni congress hai farmers ke aage karke farmers ke naam pe ghatiya politics khel rahi hai
800+ Farmers died in Process
Farmers are not stopped to sell APMC then why so much opposition
Bad news for small farmers
'They're Trying to Wipe Us Off the Map.' Small American Farmers Are Nearing Extinction.
I come from an India where comedians talk reality and politicians do comedy.
Major concern of farmers is that gradually govt will stop buying their produce and they have to suffer current situation (Private buying at APMCs) of selling their produce at loss in Private Market also. And their concern is genuine. A legalised MSP will safeguard farmers interest and governments promises of better rates in private market which are being propagated by this bill.
Support farmers 
Jai ho farmers 
"Allahamdulilha ... Farmers are real warriors !!!!,"
Log samjh nahi skta h  others County se log twitter key tha  kise aak ke chalte pura india farmers ka nuksan 
"This debate should go to SC. Let SC announce an expert committee. Let the farm laws be reviewed by all farm unions, across India & other stakeholders, within 6 months. "
The leader which keeps farmers of India happy will rule the country.
Thank you so very much for repealing the 3 farm laws on gurpurab  god bless you pm modi ji
Is Modi going to enact national security law against these farmer protests as China ccp did to Hongkong protests?
"Biggest mistake was messing with punjabi sikhs and their future livilhood and rights to land. They have been reminded of 1980s state oppression, injustice and genocide thats still unresolved. To add insult to injury they attacked sikhism, integrity of indian sikhs and declared all farmer protestors as khalistanis and terrorists. When rights enshrined in indian constitution are denied and hindered then india has become a dictatorial authoriterian state which it mostly has been since 1950s especially against the  brave Sikhs. Hence now karma will take its course and things will need to change to bring justice to the genocided, oppressed, powerless and voiceless."
"SG read the farm bill from top to bottom, left to right and vice versa and can't notice that the corporates are not liable if they breach the contract/agreement with the farmers as farmers complaints won't be entertained by the govt & even the court can't interfere. Wasn't this a red flag?"
We all South Indian farmers will sit on agitation now to bring back those laws..
Chacha bookish economy aur farming ke field m bht farq hota hai .khash krke farmer exploitation ko rokne ke liye 
Is the bill for the farmers or farmers are for the bill
Farmers may have some genuine concerns but these bill have been discussed over 17 years. 
"City people if do not know about farmer situation then please do put hate comment just watch it,it's better not comment on any topic base on half information.its almost two month they are on protest in winter it's show these three kanoon are against Farmer and government should roll back it.This comment are not for troller RSS and BJP people"
" they are so powerful, they made USA led alliance a joke and lesson for other countries threatening taliban , India should watch it's media and step back they don't forgive their enemies that's taliban be aware "
