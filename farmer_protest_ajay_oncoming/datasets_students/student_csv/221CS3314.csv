Government should Resolve issues of indian farmers 
Now I don't support farmers protest
This is difference between Yogiji & RSS picked politicians. 
Farmers are real heros
4- if it is prevent exploitation of farmers by bicholia why no intervention of civil courts for grievance handling?
farmers are the second mother of every human being government should think twice on laticharge attacking farmers and senior citizens is not good
"How pathetic these people are in comments, saying ""we support farmers"" just by seeing this video, well done india "
India also have to take security step against Taliban
"The best part of this interview is that farmers have proclaimed pm modi as the champion  of lies, another great achievement of modi."
"Owaisi is great ,he will surely support Hindu rashtra"
"The new laws do have the potential to improve the financial  condition of farmers( IMF Chief economist Gita Gopinath had too said this ), but has it's own loopholes which can be misused against the farmers. "
"BJP Is full of arrogance, Yogi is a failure , Yogi should resign, Modi should resign"
Shame on farmer leader and shame on Khalistanis..
"I support farmers from my state of Odisha who are mostly poor in comparison to those from Punjab and Haryana. I'm neither pro farmers nor anti Government in the present protest which is mostly Punjab and Haryana centric who seems to be well off, but I have faith that the new bill with some minor corrections will bring the necessary fresh changes in the farmers from my state who otherwise are poor all along. So,  worth a try. Before anyone commenting on the topic please download the Farmers bill 2020 and study it carefully from every angle. If you want to understand what the bill projects you can see it in the explanation given as a guide to IAS studies by Dhristi IAS - Farmers bill 2020 which has explained all angles attached to the bill in 3 hours. Let better sense prevail in these trying moments of Covid - 19. "
Free all the farmers in Jail
Seller want minimum support price
Himmat hai modi ji ki.... So much patience... The quality of a Holy man.. Respect u
We support BJP..
"You  not see what is happening in india  with kashmir .now wait for pak ,taliban army,china and others surprise."
"Shame on you India, hitting the farmers, who feed you."
"why dont you correct your caption and say ""the sikh farmers are being targeted left right and center, we know the truth, this is 2020, god bless Cell phones!!"
1:03 Farmers have complained about them and have demanded reforms. Which are those changes demanded by farmers? Since when? Why haven't they happened already. No comment
Good to have people like you .keep supporting our farmers 
I am actually supportive of the move. Reforms can only happen if BJP remains in power and farmers are a big vote base.
Abolishing APMC in bihar has had very bad effect. Farm laws are likely to create monopoly of corporates. States should create a cooperative mechanism. Bottom line is if Farmers do not want the law then why force a law. Surely someone else is benefited. If government wants to do away with MSP then government should  state that clearly.
"Why? You better bring it back with another policy. C'mon man, I loved you for this. Farmers needed this. Tikait won. Congi-librus and pseudo-communists won."
And farmer help us to live.....
"If the laws are repelled then i want millions of hindus on the streets, blocking roads etc etc demanding a hindu rashtra.... Seeing that is how we want to govern the nation....."
"Farmer's leader= we don't need any changes or improvements in agriculture,we are happy with our condition."
Election is not the main reason jo vote bjp ko dene wale hai wo dene hi wale hai vice versa
i hope Pakistan-taliban break this mental slavery in Pakistan too!!
In short these 3 bills are only good on papers.. But practically they will exploide farmers very badly.. And this only farmers can get.. I am standing strong with farmers.. 
Repeal 3 Bill and make sure law of the MSP
"The people who think that farmers get freebies from the government should try shaking hands with them, they are rough and tough from the toil ! It is physically challenging work, in the hot Sun, far more challenging than the most intensive HIIT exercise programs in air conditioned gyms! There is no relief mentally either. They risk their lives, one of my relatives died due to snake bite while she was working in the farm. Farms are away from the village and the city, even medical aid is not available at hand easily . So it is risky business I am disappointed by the way general public dont care and neither does the government ! Today no farmer wants his son or son-in-law to be a farmer ! Young boys who are farmers dont get brides! The farmers only want a better life for their children. For their future is dark This is just sad !"
"2- Stubble burning and subsequent surge in air pollution in and around the NCR region cannot be dealt lightly, neither in short run nor in long run. The approach should be accommodative, cooperative, judicious and participatory to tackle the issue involving Every stakeholders but these farmers have been reluctant or rather insensitive to this perpetual problem."
"Even world Bank  and imf , usa supported this bill"
Happy republic Day dear farmers
Bharat maathake jai Kisan Agree Kalchar farmers fill bill Mod'is filled Government fake modi.....................
"I dont think the intermediaries would go alltogether as the companies would still require to approach farmers for contract farming.  The companies would probably require services of these intermediaries to handle this.  Agreed, the extent of the cartelization or monopolization would go away though."
"1st it became Khalistan movement as we had seen redfort, indian flag was removed,"
Government should repeal farm laws immediately. 
The agriculture minister himself is saying that there is no need of charcha (Discussion) on this ....yet some guys in the comment section think that repealing is good enough without a discussion..the new India mitron ...
"Bhaji thank you very much for supporting us.......people who still think that WE are wrong....must understand that NO FARMERS, NO FOOD "
All delhites are in full support of farmers
Without Farmers No Food.
We have many videos made on why farmers are protesting but no one discuss about their demands
"Democracy literally means the government of people. If half of the majority are not happy with the act then take it back, that's all we are asking. Indian govt are really acting like a monarch smh"
Bad... Worst... Its all over for Agricultural Reforms.   Tikait (Decoit ) won... Anna Hazare moment for Modi Government
"Sir I never had the exposure or dream to become an IPS because I grew up in an environment where we only discussed Punjab and Khalistan. But today at age 45, i feel my life has totally been transformed and I owe you a lot. I feel not only educated but confident in most current affairs.  Love from Canada"
APMC ... can be used as benchmark for setting MSP as a minimum procurement price for the commodities?
Farm law may come back after election
Glad u were not biased on your take.. we just need unbiased news in these times. If there is proper regulation of this with farmers not being taken advantage of then I tnk the farmers will be hugely benefitted by this bill.
Begging in the streets of UP for Votes from farmers.
Every government is like a mother to their population. But in case of Muslims and BJP the relationship  is of between  step mother and step son.
"I feel Modi-shah did good thing..If they didnt revoke, opposition only speak this and pass missinformation ....Poor farmers may vote for Anti-national elements.. It good wise decision   (  I came from farming background family and still we are doing farming (my family and I was very angry on tha t day)"
