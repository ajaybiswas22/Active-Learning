By chance Modi Ji has done right thing. Hope they do not bend to these blackmailing people sitting around Delhi.
India has 600 million farmers.
Centre should immediately call a meeting with farmer and eradicate the bill as soon as possible 
"Nice indians now facin' problem with its own farmer and we , Bangladesh, are takin' advantage of it. "
Ar ye to india Pakistan ka border ha 26jan can ve avoided btw
"Long live Farmers, Long live their Patriotism. Long live Sikhism. Long live their fighting Spirit."
"The one dead farmer killed himself by driving the tractor at high speed into a barricade and the tractor toppling on top of him. What your headline seemed to miss was the numbers of Indian police men and women who died as a result of the protestors actions. The protesters were protesting against the addition of an option to sell their crops by themselves, without middlemen eating into their profits. This riot was backed by non-else than Greta Thunberg who was involved in producing and releasing a google toolkit outlining the incidents on these dates, inciting these people to do what they did! Environmental Greta backed those who destroy Indias environment by stubble burning, use pesticides prolifically making that area the cancer capital of India and whose indiscriminate use of fertiliser has polluted the water table. Well done Greta!"
The farmers are rebels without a cause. The don't understand what the are fighting about. They are the shame of the nation
I think farm bill is good for farmers
This was all over social media from past week. Modi take back the farm bills and say that he did that because of Amrinder Singh (Punjabs ex CM) and then he gonna make a collision govt with them.
"Please do a Hindi & Punjabi version of this and distribute it widely in your home state of Punjab, so that the farmers really get educated and know the truth."

"The news came first, the incident happened later. The flag on the glimpse of Punjab on the 26 January parade was the one which was hoisted on the Red Fort. This is not a flag, it is Nishan Sahib. Because of this Nishan Sahib, the Khalsa Army liberated the daughters and sisters of India from Ahmed Shah Abdali and kept the shame of India. This is the Nishan Sahib whose divine principle closed the North East borders forever to end 1000 years of slavery of Hindustan."
Proud to be Farmers
for this situation central is responsible. this is the because of negligence of govt looks on farmers protests.
Jai shree ram Jay yogi baba ke vote for bjp
"Har ek andheri raat ki ek sunhari subah bhi hai, we should stand with our beloved farmers."
its shameful for us that we are having such leaders. it would probably take 2-3 minutes to completely remove barigating and march upto rashtrapati bhavan. Its the kindness of these people that they are not doing anything . Its the agenda of polititians to poke farmers in a hope that they will do something and godi media will make a move out of it.
Support Indian people
"4. Civil courts have been added in the new ammendment as a place to settle disputes, its just that it takes a lot of time to disputes in courts, But now the farmer there also have the option."
"Very well explaiined... , about the farming bills"
"Please form a political party with name KISAN MAZDOOR PARTY INDIA and participate in MP elections and also in different states assembly elections like Punjab 2022 and Haryana. Be your own boss rather than looking towards corrupt traditional parties. If aam admi party can form govt in Delhi then why can't you. After independence this is first time so many people from different states gathered under one umbrella, so try to avail this golden opportunity. If Kisan can manage this Dehli Morcha peacefully and properly why can't they run a country."
"This asininely statement that farmers opposition is pointless is also illogical. Because the farmers are the aggrieved party which was never consulted before drafting the laws. Does Modi government knows better than the farmers interests better than the farmers themselves? MODI IS EXPLOITING THE MAJORITY BY CHURNING OUT LAWS WITHOUT MUCH THOUGHT AND DEBATES. EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT DEMONETISATION, GST AND OTHER HALF COOKED DISASTERS."
There can be flaws in the current bill that the government has passed but I see this as a very necessary and effective step Indian government has taken and in the long run will help farmers to earn way more money then they are earning right now...
Shame on you NDTV.. instead of saying BJP MP you have written it as Ex-congress MP
"Except stubble burning demand, i support farmers but you cant support stubble burning. It has crazy effect not only on weather but smog it forms over delhi, up and bihar"
"The main issue isnt that Punjabi farmers dont trust the central government, its that Mandis are much MUCH larger in Punjab and Haryana then anywhere else in this nation and Mandis will become weaker due to these bills and many farmers even in these states are happy with these bills, this is because that cost of transportation is reduced and proper infrastructure would be provided by the private player and talking about the MSP, you can find out the MSP which the government provides on their website, the MSP has increased compared to last year"
India  will be fine after modis departure and the whole World  will be fine after the destination of Hindus
Now Farmers are losing their credibility.
made Modi Jittery and total Nervous
Jab kisian bill pass hua tho godi media master stroke bol ke didonar piti thi phir kisian bill return hua tho thabi bhi master strock hai godi media ka
Only reason to repeal is upcoming election 
Farmer laws are good ...Anna ji .please read it
Once in Singur West Bengal same kind of huge protest has been organized by the farmers against TATA company for establishing their automobile company in singur. Farmers won the battle making TATA leave Bengal after 5 years later no major company is ready to establish their company in Bengal and now Bengal became the 3rd largest exporter of skilled and non-skilled labor to western and southern states.
"Most of the Media and celebs in India are silent and are against farmers, thank you for the video"
"* Farm size- the average farm size in India is 1.3 hectare. While in Australia its 800 hectare, Argentina 518 hectare, Canada 315 hectare, US 250 hectare, UK 86 hectare, so the average Indian farmer only has 1/50 - 1/500 of the land a farmer elsewhere will exploit, to generate an income."
Thank you Modi G for repealing these laws...U r a great leader.. Salute to u..1st time u made a great decision...
"Similarly MSP minimum support price means, even if the quality of crop turn out to be low, Farmer can atleast recover the cost. On other hand where the quality is better, Bid to procure better quality start from MSP, let the farmer decide at what price above MSP he is willing to sell. "
"Rakesh tikayat  and congress party , Prashant kisore making this programme  2024 election s stunts in up"
Earlier I was very perplexed about this law...Why there is tussle between Govt and Farmers ? Why farmers are protesting and Why Govt is not revoking this law. But Now I'm happy that all my doubts cleared  through your lecture . Really It  helped me to understand the crux of the matter . You r such a outstanding teacher. 
"Simple Dr Watson. Win win for the BJP. The party (a win with Amrinder, exit from Punjab politics - Congress, AAP and Akali in one swell swoop) in Punjab is more important now. Old wine can be served in new bottles along with the farmers later on. Just saying.. not politics but plain logic."
2. If the farmers have belief in MSP system why can't the government give written assurance on Msp in pvt market.
So the farmers can get a Saficient deal for there hard work.
1. 2.5 % of the sale price is the commission for the middlemen. Buys onions for Rs 5 and sells for Rs 80. How is this 2.5% to middleman turned to 7% to farmers ??
Still some andhbhakt believe that modi and other care for farmer
Tight slap on godi media thanks bro 
17:05 he is only telling half side of the fact and misleading... Why don't check the income of US farmers it's relatively more than average Americans and most of the farmers are in excellent condition... Only 2.2million people are there in farming thier cause of failing are completely different from indian farming.. Reasons are also very different!! Wtf dont mislead people
No it will hit farmer leaders and congress and also who funded this protest..
"Our top priority should be safeguarding our borders with Pakistan so that no terrorism can spill onto our side of the border. Afghan themselves are responsible for their own freedom. Russia, China both have accepted Taliban as a reality. We shouldn't really get involved in this mess."
Congrats farmers. 
Modi and other political parties are enjoying the parade when the farmers are suffering. If farmers are not happy why don't modi take back his bills which farmers are unhappy and being pushed to have them.
Though i like all of your videos but this time i am not convinced  as i myself am a  farmer from Uttarakhand . You have vast  knowledge of academics but i suggest you following...
Farmers I salute you all and support you all.
Mahatma Ji....Kindly be the guest of the farmers at any of the protest sites
As well as farmers right
