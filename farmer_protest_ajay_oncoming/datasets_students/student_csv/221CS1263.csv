What's happening with the Farmers of our country May God have mercy on deceased 
I dont know why but media got hurt to see farmers win. Can see all reportrs in pain and vain expressns hahaha
"Most of these protestors don't know the 3 farm laws. And most important these farmers are also citizens, they should do this protest peacefully. What they did in 26 Jan is a shameful act. If they are civilised then they should do the protest in a civilised manner. That's all"
"The BJP is working to sell, lease, auction and handover public infrastructure to private and corporate supply chain. Like sarkari schools, the dark laws will destroy farming as it has done to education, healthcare and employment dedicated to the poor !"
Don't worry Rakesh ticket yogi Ji Modi ji BJP 300 plus plus plus
"Even this is not a coincidence that when everyone was coming to delhi first day he came delhi around 5am he was not stopped by police from delhi and Haryana dont know why.  Then He came to india gate, seesh ganj sahib Gurudwara and he was posting everything on social media while police was arresting others who were caming to delhi before and after him. "
shame on you government. Farmers are fighting for their rights. Farmers are honest loyal
Shri Modi ji ko salute.  He is greatest son of soil.  I share the feeling of shri Modi ji. 
"Sir you are totally wrong. Do you think you are better then Modiji,? No no no, you can give your opinion but not your conclusion "
Farmers are right!!!!!
"There is a khalistani group 'Sikhs for justice' funded by American CIA which announced 1.8 crore to whoever will host sikh flag on India gate/red fort on 26 Jan, remember one thing for life, whenever there is a riot anywhere in the world, some George Soros money is floating around."
Indian  farmers ? ?.............No no no no never. they are not Indian  farmers.
"This is sad. Most of the remarks said this.  But did any single body seen supporting these laws? We were only seeing only Takait n Gang and Pappu gang. After repellment of laws, only protesting farmers are being hailed. Not a single interview of farmers who were supporting these laws being shown. So, ultimately Govt had no other way."
Remember 120 million farmers in India .
From defarming that 76% to more manageable percentage. So Modi ji is doing the needful!
Condemning 26 violence (farmer police included) shame godi media!!
Sikh community always scarifies for country and this time govt came on backfoot for our farmers brother.
I am from bihar my whole family is in farming but they don't think there is any problem with this law because bihar don't get any benefit of green revolution and other farmers in my village are also have no problem.
We are protecting our nation not our agriculture only . If these agriculture laws will apply then the first impact will on metropolitan cities.     Farmers of Punjab and Haryana are educated nd captivated.
So many election during this law.Bjp won all this election.
This came a little late just before elections. Remember that if Sardars can fight oppressive Mughals then they will also fight oppressive BJP.  A government must listen to the people's voice always.
One must notice the camps of pro farmers and against farmers in several news forums. It's cut throat hate levels. I  am growing anxiety related to men in ours society. My father was right that BJP would be catastrophic for our country!
I support farmers I stand with farmers
person at 7.34 wake up man they are farmers of our country. Delhi people should stand with farmers and should help them in getting their rights. ..
Opposition parties some of them who exploited India in name of development are now agitating the innocent farmers to become violent . Shame on those people . Please get a life or leave politics forever . Shameless opposition. Won't do anything won't let other develop .
"Third law simply allows private players to store farm produces, which was not allowed as india was deficient in food production and govt feared hoarding. Now India has so much food grain production that it can't consume what it produces."
Whats wrong with Indian media
"I know I'm not that old to talk politics nd all but bhaiya I don't know why I become so depressed whenever I start thinking about our country's  condition. They are literally torturing farmers, censoring social media, asking companies for our personal data, controlling news media and god knows what else. I love my country so much, but yesterday when I was at my uncle's"
people like you and me buy from bazzaar whre in the farmers sell cheap and we buy at higher prices and the middle men make the most. Now when the govt gives the farmers and option to sell directly to corporates which will be benificial to them and to consumers.
"Correction the APMC in different states is regulated by the respective SARKAR of that PARTICULAR states. One of the major concerns of the farmers was the fear of losing land to the BIG GIANTS which was not discussed in the video, which in turn is just fear with no grounds since THE CONTRACT FARMING AS TOLD IN THE BILLS AND IN THIS VIDEO will ONLY be done ON THE PRODUCE and IT MUST NOT INCLUDE BINDING OF ANY KIND on THE LAND of the farmer. I completely agree that these reforms seem to be a bit Theoretical-Revolution, but the need of the hour is to plug the loopholes which are giving the farmers GENUINE concerns not FORCE the COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL OF THESE BILLS. I would not like to talk about HOW THE BILLS were passed tho."
You didn't tell anything about new farm bill and started comparing it 
India needs a better government who can think for the interest of Indian farmers and youth.
We stand with farmers 
We should take inspiration from farmers and be prepared for 2023 polls...lets show what happens when you try do jhumla with public..
After great U-turn from Modiji.....reminded me of Gandhiji's famous U turn in Non-Cooperation movement.....Great Modiji....
So pleased and happy for our farmers. God be with you always.
"* Government will repeal all 3 farm laws, it's in Parliament's Winter session."
"Kisan zindaabad. Real power of india kisan still keeping peaceful protest, but BJP must keep it in mind that if kisan came to fight than this govt can't survive for one week. Love kisan love NDTV. Because you are the only main stream channel who is presenting the real jounalism and bearing hardship by govt. I also respect and support Ravish bhai. Love from Pakistan"
"@ThePrint , Sir I am a Farmer's son in Hubli, Karnataka. My father grows Maize, soyabean and safflower. We don't get MSP for anything. Can't government buy soyabean, safflower at MSP in Karnataka ? If it can, why is it not buying ?"
The Indian farmers are treated well  by the BJP and co .
Support the farmers
I think bjp should remember india is mainly an agricultural country. Agriculture accounys for approximately 33% of India GDP and employs nearly 62% of the population. Ek aisa wqt tha k hum Hindustani bhukmari k shikar the an green revolution k baad aur kisaano ki mehnat k baad aisa wqt aya hai k india exports surplus rice and other harvest to other countries
Migrant Sikh farmers own and occupy large tracts of Benami farm lands in Terai regions owned by clearing forest and pastoral lands in the Terai regions fearing government action there has been conflicts over several decades.
I am fighting with my family cause they are brainwashed by godi media. I was successful to change their view by showing scoopwhoop video. So proud of you samdhish and team. I request you if you could cover the situation on 25th and 26th of jan so we get real news. Thank you. Jai kisan. Jai hind. Wish i could help our kisans in someway.
Farmers will be crushed. This government is too powerful. Farmers should tread carefully. I suggest to go back home.
"At that point of dispute, the loser would be obviously the small farmer. He has no wherewithal  to fight the mighty corporates. "
They are not farmers....... opposition parties
"Existing system of procurement was used for 70 years, did it made the farmers rich?"
Stand with Farmers .
"In over 20 days, more than 22 farmers have died. The priority should be to diffuse the situation. One solution is to enact new laws incorporating the substantive demands of the farmers which government has virtually agreed to and also incorporate a repeal clause in it annulling the three existing reform laws. The new enactment and annulment shall happen at the same time, thus meeting the demand of the farmers and government retaining its seemingly fragile and recalcitrant prestige. "
Somehow I seriously cannot accept any negative comments on Modi. I think he would had thought enough on each scenario. The way they tackled 370 abrogation is nothing when compared with Farm bill. 
Shekhar sir could plz plz plz make a Hindi version of this episode so I can at least convince my father and my fellow farmers that these bills are for our good.
An eyeopener account on farm bills and why we should stand with farmers. Govt is simply acting insensitive to the matter. Preposterous.
"Beautiful, since long I was waiting for this beautiful. Going to share it with my friends and family but 2/3 things you have smartly ignored. 1 Govt tax. On farmers and middleman. 2. Employment created by Pvt players. 3. Formalising the farm/agriculture economy. These are huge factors. Thats why I support this Farm bill."
Hlw Abhi $ Niyu . I Love Your Videos So Much . Can You Please Make A Video On #Hindu Code Bill # Please 
"Whatever people say (yeay I do agree Hindustan me sare steps Election oriented hi the)  yet a great step by Government Of India, it was getting more sensitive issue. Thanx to PM of India"
