Congratulations to all the farmers and people of India who supported them.. love you you who supported the farmers from different parts of India... still wait for formal procedure.
No farmers No food
finally justice for the farmers
"Zee  channel is BJP channel, so how come they speak against BJP.."
Farmers are role model for all Indians.
"As you talked about about the control phase of corporatization, that regulations have to be mandated for selling agricultural produce, can't we access the process which Starbucks does with coffee beans farmers?"
"Brave Farmers! Listen to them, they bring you food !"
RIP Small & poor Farmers
You discussed only the flaws of APMC Mandis and not the advantages. 
Now our beloved farmer vir das will be happy .....I'm a farmer's son and i know these laws  were need of hour ....but tikait like so-called farmer who live luxurious life hijacked the farmers mind for their  middleman masters ....now no govt will bring these laws ..n nothing will change in life of farmers..they will remain poor like always.. by these laws there was a little hope perhaps something can change in farmers life.....but back to same hole ...
Rakesh Tiket khud hi Daket hain cheap publicity ke liye kuch bhi bolta 
"While the anslysis is loaded with the SG's prejudice against BJP, but Modi Govt is not the one to shy away from a challenge... This may well be a tactical retreat, time will tell ofcourse..."
"If it is very important like pm says in this speech. Then I would like to ask why he repeal this law though he know this law good for farmer. Then what make him to repeal this law, you willingly take away goodness of the farmer law what force you to do that."
"Farmer can sell there crop out of mandies , i want to know where they can sell their crops , mean to say door to door and will ask every person , will they buy their crops ( mtlb ghar ghar jaakr loko se puche bhai apne meri fasal leni hai , apne gehu lena hai chawal lena hai ) ....... first bill question arises"
"Hooligans not Farmers protesting in the most non violent way possible. Our National Flag was desecrated. Totally unacceptable to indulge in arson, rioting and waging war against the Nation."
"He ruined the lives of youth  ,farmers and poor Indians."
Congratulations to farmers....
I know it's very hard to farm like in this time but you are throwing india flag like this shame on you punjabi
This was a rich farmer's agitation. 
Why don't these all opposition work together to defeat BJP in next elections?
Why don't people are understanding  that this law is not only  sikh or Punjab specific  but is for whole  nation 
"We the people of Bihar strongly support the Farmers Bill 2020, this law gives special options to the farmers,"
"Have you ever wondered that Congress is just Demoralising the people of India, no matter weather he is BJP or any other. I know congress can do nothing. If we compare Japan and India, Japan Is much more developed than our country, although it got democracy later than India. Same goes for South Korea and uhmm if you think they are small countries that you can take China as an example. China is very much developed in military and technology as well"
tickat should become p m of next  india he is bachpai of congress
Agriculture law bnona state list de under h ...fr centre govt . koi v law kiwe bna skdi h ..eh sida sida indian constitution nu challenge krna hoea ...j centre govt constitution follow nhi krde pya...fr o aam loka toh ki umeed krde ne...and j govt eni hi sahi ae....fr o farmers di gal sun lain...centre governmnt nu darr kis gl de h..
Corona affected persons must be asked to caugh and shake hands and hug these farmers so that they can never think of protests.
Can you make this same topic again with the present updates because it is most important topic concerning democracy. India was lead by practical wisdom of common people..  So India was not affected badly by many international issues. I respect the wisdom of the farmers (housewives) and the people encounter realities regularly which academics will never understand.
"10%rich farmers won over the 90%poor farmers.... today we saw, Democracy also manipulated by few"
"Today the consumer class is silent. Apart from Punjab and Haryana, big and small consumers in other states are also supporting Modi because they still have religion and nationalism in their mouths."
Arfa the excelled journalist. God bless you. Thanks for true reporting. Now no need of main  or bikaow godi media. Social media has filled void place.
thankyou ma'am its really clear all doubts on farm bill. waiting foe more videos like this...
As their is election in UP. Modi govn. don't want to take risk.
Victory for the farmers.
Thank you so much for covering this!! Kisaan mazdoor ekta zindabad
"I can see a lot of comments criticizing government, its so unfortunate that they only know half of the story. I think literally no one knows why they are protesting ( the people out of india ), what government did to resolve it, they just want to criticize the government, just do some research on it guys before choosing a side."
"Farmers win, Government losses"
Farmers Won...
"Undoubtedly it is defeat of poor farmers of the country and the victory of those who are fraud , criminals , destroyer and blind ."
Here comes the spokesman for Taliban in India
The word ' middleman ' is Being criminalized throughout decade. Every educated nuts like us and also our policymakers Don't know what crucial role a middleman plays in supply chain and how deeply and logically farmers are dependent on them. They are not just money grabbers what most of us think. The price gap of a product between Farm gate and retail price is not just middleman's profit. Most of it is the cost of providing services and wastage of produce throughout the process because of inefficient supply chain.
"Today I lost the inner Respect for all the Indian farmers . I WILL NEVER EVER Respect any farmer from now onwards till my last breath . Today farmers have hurt the pride of our and their own Nation too . India will never forget this unethical , brutal attack by farmers on their own Nation. If we have such farmers we don't need Pakistan and China to witness our down fall . And after today's incident I now think farmers deserve some hardships . Today they insulted our own Nation on international level "
Spineless modi  now this will boost confidence of anti national elements. Farmer lost dakait won Enjoy democracy 
This is not victory of Indian farmers it's a win of Congress and co Dallas
JAB TAK CONGRESS PARTY RAHEGA AATANK WADI KAM NEHI HOGA
"If the farmers want to suffer, let them. What else? Finally, it is the farmer who lost."
Even I was supporting our farmers but for the cause....not for this act....shameful....bus Ka tractor se hatana...woh bhi Jo govt ke subsidy se Mila hai
Even Australia Had similar reforms and protets and India too ncie India great Way ahead. They are stopping stubborn burning Majority of farmers want those laws only farms from Punjab and haryana are doing because they are richer than otehr south indian farmers which makes them earn a bit less or make less profit ratehr than good Income than now.
"Yogi Adityanath is also on target as he is getting more acceptance as hindutva leader than Modi. This move will affect small farmers of UP in Purvanchal. First the Brahmins are angry on yogi, then yogi action on Kaleem Siddiqui who had relations with Mohan bhagwat and now this."
Farmer protest is still continue even after 5months of this video 
BJP mistook farmers as Shaheen Bagh! 
The point is this is Punjab specific issue. Centre govt should allow states to decided whether they want to implement these laws or not.
Rakesh Dacoit and his peaceful protest
"These farmers are going to starve and she talks about protesting during a pandemic, smh."
The farmer agitation  was politically supported.
A simple solution to solve the problem for grain storage would be that farmers can form their own regional cooperative like amul. It will reduce the financial burden on the government and at the same time empower the farmer. The concept of MSP on all crops is not feasible. It will increase the fiscal burden on the government.
We are not there to support them but thank you for everything you team are doing very great work for india
