No farmer no food 
"By this draconian law , we lost life of 600 farmers....Modi is such a arrogant and sadist PM in Indias history"
But apples from himachal and jammu are already transported accross india without any resistance...so what's new in this bill?
Keep your spirits high brother farmers.the world is watching and victory soon for you guys. Love and prayers from Malaysia tamilan urban farmer.
3.  In 2019 farmers can't sell their 
"It's so funny during CAA protest, delhi riots, everyone blamed one person Tahir Hussain, and now this police officer doesn't want to take one person's name. It's a sad sad day in our country. Only way to show solidarity with farmers is by  coming to roads. All Indians come together in each state in each village in every road. Everyone all at once ! This nation needs to be protected from the current goons ruling our country and not our protestors!"
"Tell me only one thing! Just one!  What and why in the world, Punjabi ""farmers"" were doing and protesting on Cowbelt UP soil?!"
"You are supporting black laws by your headlines- 'Sarkar baatcheet ko tyar, fir kyun takrar'."
"The wheat farmers in Punjab grow poison(most of them). The government for many years has been a garbage dump for them, they sell to govt wheat for 30 and the govt further sells the crop for 2-3. The wheat crop is grown with large amounts of pesticides and fertilizers that no company can ever buy that stuff. This is the main reason why these farmers started the protest, in fear that if govt stops buying their crops then who will."
It means an  indirectly government want the large farmers become trader too.
Zee news shame to India
"1. Might lead to hoarding and black marketing. (Majority of the farmers are S&M, storing their own crops can be a tough task, on the other hand the revision of EC list can give Corporates an upper hand to Store & Manipulate the price to their benefit)"
You can't defeat a TRACTOR using cane mr Indian police
Tikait defeated Modi hurrre....
Zee media boycott
"These gentleman is simply trying to develop anti Modi , ant BJP sentiment among listeners. He has no concrete argument except the panwala type "" i believe that....  ""."
"3- Agriculture Census 2015-16 published in 2019 revealed that average size of land holdings in respective states of Punjab and Haryana is higher than the Average size of national holdings and much higher than that of the state of UP, Bihar, Odisha, WB, MP, Chattisgarh  and other states who have greater dependency of population on agriculture sector for their subsistence therefore creates a condition which coupled with the assistance during the Green Revolution and resulting infrastructure and ecosystem  favours the Punjab farmers more to the farmers of other agricultural states in terms of production capacity, volume, automation, supply on large scale and etc. "
"PRICE RISING HIGH and FARMERS Not getting the right amount. 12 hrs duty, unemployment, But only one ISSUE  Religion."
Not every farmer is happy with this decision shame on PN and Haryana farmers
"Even farmers seems bunch of hooligans , may have forced police to this extent..."
Violence and the Disturbance in the Capital on our Republic Day is wrong but The Tiranga was not removed at all and that Sacred flag was put on an Empty pole... Don't make any comment which hearts anybody's religious sentiments because United We Stand (Hindu Muslim Sikh Christian Jain Bodh) the Stronger We Are...
"2:20 I would like to point out that the Govt will not need to take out the APMC brick by brick. Sir the issue here is that the corporates have a certain financial backing with which they can provide a price slightly hire than APMC for a couple of years (3-4  years lets assume). Farmers will therefore sell to these corporates at higher prices and no procurement will occur through mandis. This will effectively drain the mandis of the mandi tax and mandis will eventually fall into ruins by themselves. In the 5th year when the corporate silos will be already full due to excess procurement in the previous years ( farm production of wheat, paddy has always been greater than consumption for many years now), the corporates may choose not to buy at all or buy at very lower prices, and the option of mandis at that point in time may not be available at all. I hope this gets the point across"
Spinelessness of Indian media at its peak
We want coverage of farmer's protest
So... reading between the lines ..now that RIL has acquired Future retail group and has consolidated or rather monopolized retail sector now... this Bill's are like a return gift from the sarkar as a token of loyalty.
We know who owner of ZEE news is  bjp mp himself
NDTV - Farmers are hero and victims. - True
"Good video but does not explain everything. Abhi create one more follow up video with 3 parts with each part focusing on 3 issues on the bill. To understand the farm bill you need to understated the history of Indian agriculture for last 30 to 40 years. Most people putting comments were not even born then. P. Saianth  was invited by Supreme court  to be part of expert panel to resolve this issue. He declined the supreme court saying he would not want to be a ""party to death"" by any panel formed to resolve the crisis. He did that as he knows that the panel being formed wont do anything for farmers. It will be just like any other panels that have been formed before. If Supreme court invited him, he is qualified to speak on the issue. I suggest that you listen to him as he knows the history of Indian agriculture better than most of people."
This acts are more favorable towards the company and not legally empower the farmers.
Wow only a handful women protesting and so much media coverage and here in india over 2 million farmers protesting and no media coverage 
Supporter of farmers 
Would be better this congress goes to mone vart rest of the life. Its the best thing this haramkhor can do for people of india 
"Wow good batting by police helmet also nice BUT remember police we are n u alive bcoz of Farmer producing Food, vegetables. From 2day u don't buy any food only have salary."
Always be together brothers  punjab and haryana you guys are real power if you are together
"Safety net not always work for rich farmers, even FCI is not directly involved in procurement. It is entirely done through state agencies like PUNSUP PUNGRAIN MARKFED etc. First time your lecture was looks like half boiled egg."
"Andhbhkts who called farm protest as international conspiracy are today talking about democracy. Andhbhkts who called farmers as traitors, anti-nationals, goons, khalistani are today talking about national interests. Even a chameleon don't change colour so fast. "
Justice for farmers 
This is not a farmer protest anymore. It's Khalistani movement backed by Pakistan. Now state machinery should be applied with full force.
This time we watch tractor rally of farmers....the real republic Day rally
Bhiya salute and lots of love to your hard work and efforts.. Godi media will never explain this..
This bill has removed that obstacle in front of the farmers and allowed them to do business with companies or the customers directly due to the contract based farming.
"Mr. Prime Minister, we are disipointed on your decission to repeal the farm laws. "
1 bro i agree with ur point but when farmers were protesting from last 2 months they did not listen to us meetings were non resultable cnn u imagine 2 months it this cold more than 80 farmers died
"What a reporting, man! Salute to these farmers, their spirit and courage."
"Kick the butt of the BJP in the upcoming election. General people across India should think, why are these people wasting their time for the past 9 months. "
3rd Bill is very Dengerous for every Indian..
"Ask pakistan for aid. They already gave Afganistan the taliban, so why not a way to live?"
I greatly respect farmer's but people faced behind mask who came to destroy peaceful protest must be arrested. Shame on them who want to bring India down.#eternalfarmers
Farmers died and cars were burnt. What is more important? Human lives or car ?
"The most important element in a news is truth,supported by right facts,which generally 99% of news channels are lacking today.I feel more mentally safer and truly awared of happenings in the country on watching his videos than news channels."
"Im against this law as it exploits the farmers . The contract farming  is something farmers feared as it give open permission to udyogpatis to exploit farmers and removing MSP will bring our farmers below poverty line which could be disastrous and can lead to famines and depletion of economic liberalism and turning indian economy into capitalist economy whic can be pretty fatal for our country  . Jai kisan , kisan ekta zindabad"
"This is not real picture, in farmers protest had many gunde, andh bhkt, violence maker, rules breakers, who spread violence in Delhi, or  logo Ko yh lgra h ki farmers violence kr rhe h "
I long to wait for your video... Thank you so much all your hard work and being voice to the great Indian farmers andolan.... Once our dictatorship regime gets over... All godi will be shut but NDTV and Wire and many such channels will like a morning star
