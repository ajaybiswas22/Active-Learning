People are with the farmers of the country. God keep farmers spirit high. JAI JAWAN JAI KISAN. JAI OUR ANN DATA
Farmers ko faltu me badnam kiya jaa raha hai.. har saal itni tight security hoti hai red fort k aas paas and delhi me bhi itni force hoti hai pr iss baar itni dheel kyu??? It's a trap !!
"A real enlightening exposition on farm laws. Congress Party stands exposed on its duplicity. However, BJP did no less politicking on farm reforms when Congress proposed it in Parliament but was vehemently opposed by BJP in both upper and lower houses. No party, I find, is doing above board politics. "
"The same symbol is in Sahib Harmandir Sahib and the rest of the Gurudwaras to whom the vigilants of every religion-Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Jaini-bow down. By putting these symbols on the borders of the country, soldiers not only protect the borders but also sacrifice their lives. This Nishan Sahib is waved in foreign countries with foreign flags."
Ye national security ke chalte decision Liya but sad about the farmers
Now the opposition will also not agree on the repeal of farm law because they wanted to poltiscise for their vote bank on the farm law.
"However... Farmer is already  free to sell crop to private sector , what is the meaning of bills then"
"What's wrong with bringing a parallel market, why allow APMC have monopoly ? Congress told they would bring the changes in Bill from 1991, but bjp did it. Why opposing now?"
Answer  : - Indian  farmers 
"Mahapanchayat of dalals, not of farmers. Farmers are being hoodwinked by these people, led by Tikait named dacoit."
"Govt should declare  its targeted purchases of food grains under Food Security Law -wheat, rice, dal etc. at the least 1 year before and announce schedule of quantity and quality of its purchases from different states and mandis along with the start and end dates. MSP is declared before the sowing starts. It should spread its procurement widely and not concentrate only on Punjab, Haryana and UP. It should not purchase food grains beyond minimum buffer stock requirements. This will remove undue benefits farmers from these 3 states are getting. But Central Govt should also remove all subsidies it gives and distribute the amount saved as DBT to all the farmers in the country along with a minimum income support to all farmers and landless workers. This will free farmers to decide what and when and how much to produce and will change the conditions for better."
Afghan Army needs Air support to defeat the Talibans.
Please don't trust him as a farmer he deceive u as a politician..... Illogical views..
"In my view Mandir Development is not important. Need to give true strength( financially support, Unity, training in physically fitness etc. to Hindus."
"These Bills are good in theory but could be a disaster in reality (agreed). But then you go on tell the current regulation and scenario in theory and miss the implementation of them, the APMC and MSP implementation, which I would like to highlight"
Is SC sleeping or what. SC had allowed farmers protest. How can they arrest
Why Panjab and Hariyana farmers protesting ? Ans: This states farmers enjoining 95% of MSP.
"Farmers ko agar really help karna cahtahe sarkar Toh Government ko fertilizer, pesticides ke cost low karne ko kaho,,,,Main Kissan family se hoon pera pitaji Kissan haa"
"Who would have thought Taliban could play Pakistan's playbook so well on Pakistan. After all, they were trained by the same western masters."
farmers are of father of national ......
The farmers agitation is only troubling  poor public and Govt appears to be least bothered. 
Ye sarkar Jo h shi h ya galat lekin future mein agar aisa hi hua tb to 370 v hatega protest k through aur CAA/NRC v hatega protest k through. This is very bad that Government couldn't deliver the bill properly.
"Those opposing the farm bill should at least watch this video once. Anyway, I support this Farm bill."
I think we youth should start farming with new technology and make India no1 in agricultural production
"What about the pollution in Delhi...Its because of the farmers...Supreme court has asked them not to burn it but they still do...If a corporation owns the land government can fine the company,which is not possible with individual farmers"
"@SG, this episode was more like a political interest and not like ""National Interest"". You should have told us that what was good and bad in these three bill from your own perspective and not what Rahul Gandhi and others say. irony is that how constructive discussion is done in parliament. Like, it is responsibility of Government to take decisions for uplift of people and also it is responsibly of opposition to have constructive opposition on any topic and not just oppose for the sake of opposition. This mindset by politicians and journalists is costing India huge."
"Just to recollect, ter were farmers from south, not in this big number protested for months at delhi, jantar mantar..... naked protest, rat eating protest with no violence..... PM n govt did not have tym even to meet them... now its number game..... bigger d farmer number... protest is big n impacting d city......."
To Interfering indian govt and  farmers
Hello Guys I am a farmer from Punjab IAM telling u all that I agree some farmers became emotional and went to the red fort but BJP took  an advantage of all this and disguised there men within us . It was a very clever move of there but what good had happened. Even though it's a protest farmers have opened health camps and serving free food . Police officers have there hands tied so we cannot say a word to our cops. Nothing good has happened to either farmers nor police just BJP took benefit of it. RIP to all the people who died in farmers protest.
Only 5-6% farmer sell grains at MSP price.
"Feku ka ghamand aur obscene haughtiness got shattered. Each time bj party is defeated, india progresses. Defeat them in UP and see how great india will become."
all people protest against EVM all problems come from EVM ban EVM never come again BJP Indian poor people are happy
"This is the reality . But , donot fear , we have Modi ji . He will do , he will give all the guru mantras ."
Every citizen of India must watch the Rajya sabha video of passing these bills.
"Unfortunate really it's unfortunate,taking back  the very helpful bill,so sad.....these farmers will never understand n they want to stay under dark only...so sad"
Modi ji ki beard kam hui wese hi petrol price or attitude bhi kam ho gya.. he is good pm but can be best if he takes care of indian economy and people more properly.. 
become independent .Rich farmers ' struggle is for preserving their vested interests. Sadly new Farm Laws were  also being given a communal colour .Govt in Punjab is also controlled by these very influential Rich farmers' lobby.
All Govt and states can learn from BJP that you can just bring any bill into parliament and pass it without votes and discussion .... 
Farmer is correct . ..
"1984 se  aur ek bar ""jay javan jai kisan"". Politicians ayega jayega bolega  .Always salute  to soldiers and farmers real hero."
Farmers are very productive members  (More than 50% Indian population) of the country.
All the taxes which are there they are not put on farmers if MSP is 2000 farmer sell crop at 2000 taxes are paid by buyer not farmers and APMC in Punjab are lot easy to reach with in 3 to 5 KM
"Much as I would want to disagree, I must admit that AIM has the best measure of the Modi BJP's costly  cynical self  - seeking political moves."
You forgot the election angle in repealing farm laws
"The farmers are so aware about their rights and the govt is calling them misguided. Even they speak English, better than Modi. Hatsoff to our farmers. "
3:13 this is the bjp government versus farmers ..
Farmers nahin unhe sirf wheat belt farmers boliye. Woh saare farmers ke representative bhi nahin hain. Asli farmers baaki states ke apne farms par kaam kar rahe hain. In time pass no work waalo ko publicity mat dijiye
"Quite dissapointed with Mrs. Supriya ( congress spokes person ), she is one of the few congressmen who raises the right question and generally well prepared. However, this time she seemed to only bring up Priyanka Gandhi's arrest and not really question the arrogance and mishandling of the situation by the state governament. "
"Dear Modi ji , YOU distroyed every Economy Fields."
"Whoever questioned the farmers today in this PC on Teni resignation demand, hats off to him for possession of audacity to ask a question which can corner both SKM & government."
The security of India was favored and poor farmers lost. The middleman of the farming industry won.
"Trial the reforms in a few regions first, realise the benefits and prove to the rest the merits of the reforms (if any).  Use the excess grain for the livestock industry and increase meat production.  Concerns of the farmers must be addressed as no reforms will work without their support.  Start distributing free face masks to the protestors and villagers.  Look into providing low interest loans, the costs of agricultural inputs and export markets for agricultural products. Best wishes to India and in memory of my classmate Gurbachan Singh"
Godi media channels are not showing it
Duty magistrate's might be having some real issue with the farmer 
"They r not farmers ,they r middle man...I don't no why media has not shown When rape happened at protest ,Why don't you show that how they beat those who oppose them...26 violence and red fort , damaging public properties ,blocking national highway... "
