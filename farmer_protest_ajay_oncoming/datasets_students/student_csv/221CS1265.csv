What about farmers protest?   U beat them up so badly..you forgot about that   ?  Answer indo patel's.
With the Technology and New ACTs Actually farmers can be Price makers with online Platform for Farmers to sell their products. 
In the European Union the EU govt has given subsidies of 54 billion dollars since 2006 to support its agriculture sector to help it sustain simply as it was not profitably viable in the large scale but its something without which no one can sustain.
"The riots that are happening in India somewhere  media like Aaj tak, Zee news also has a very important role in it... Whatever be the situation in the country they never forget to defend government because they are not journalist they are paid actor of government..."
When Telecommunications was privatised they never said they are going to kill BSNL but it was put on doses slow poison and corruption within it has done it in.  Because spectrum is owned by Govt we don't understand business where in Farming farmers are the ones who produces the crop which is like Spectrum in telecommunications and if there's a dispute he can not go to court of law but has to seek remedy from a DM. That is like moving backwards for a developing country which tops the chart in most corrupt countries list
Huge respect to these farmers protesting...
"I can live without my phone, but I can't live without farmers who produce my food."
"Modi ji were also calling kishan khalistani,  terrorist. Anti national,  even killed the farmer,  you can not believe this govt"
"Disband FCI. India doesn't need wheat and rice so much. Already Punjabi farmers are producing these items excessively due to MSP, depleting water level, crop burning causing air pollution."
Are farmers celebrating republic day?
Respect all Farmer #Nofarmer#Nofood
Very informative with a generous amount of sarcasm ! Ouch Modi ji ouchh
FARMERS MUST THANKS TO NDTV
"Ma'am ,  2015 Niti Aayog data shows that 81 percent farmers know about MSP . So, why only 6 percent of them are using it. Please give some insights."
"I personally have just one issue with this analysis, which is to treat the word ""farmers"" as a homogeneous group. I believe all analysis on farmers' issues will become much more nuanced once we start categorising different types of farmers based on their landholdings, mechanisation, labour employed etc. The status quo definitely benefits some stakeholders (otherwise it wouldn't have existed) and any reform will hurt this category. At the end of the day, if the reform hurts the richest category of farmers marginally in the short run, while increasing the options for the most marginal category of farmers, then it comes down to who do you support in this scenario."
Thnx BBC for support farmers
Kejriwal ji/Aam Admi party is not worried about loosing votes in Delhi. They are confident that come next election time they will offer some freebies to the public of Delhi and buy their votes again. Now Delhi paying the price of selling their votes for cheaper electricity bill. Serves them right. Nothing is free.
" No corporates can store all the foodcrops in a state. So far i know there is a law for that. But now farmers are excluded.Before police will not allow farmers to stock, or even they cannot take their products to other states."
this was a great insight into Taliban's history. Thanks Ravishji. At least someone asks the right question with a will to know and enlighten. And thanks to Mr. Ray for sharing such stories in a such a short period.
"Being from farmers background and currently a practicing lawyer, I can definitely say that these farm bills have the power to revolutionize the entire farming industry. It will definitely be helpful in advancing the farming industry. We should have open mindset towards these bills."
#Supports farmers protect
If Farmers don't want reforms then don't give any subsidy and other debt benefits from Tax payers hard earn money.
"Pakistani here, and I pass my heart and support to the Indian farmers. "
I always like you lallantop nd ndtv .thanks for showing the truth again  unlike godi media shame on other media's like zee news abp news and others
I also see as Govt acting tough now on agitators as farmer cause cover is removed
I admire the commitment of these farmers.
I'm on police side they are not farmers my uncle got to much injury they are not farmers they are terrisot 
MSP is not for private players/ buyers( so no question of re-cartelization )  .... It is minimum price  for which Government buys (invariably  at 150 % of input cost ...for selected commodity )  from farmers  please correct yourself sir
God help  the Indian farmer  may God victory  to farmer
Govt is responsible for this. Farmers are fighting for the benefit Indians except few rich.
humble request to farmers to stop all protests...
"They are god for us, We should always respect and support farmers."
4. The whole thing about the personal relationship of the middlemen and farmers strikes me as a cultural thing in Punjab and Haryana. Maybe these state governments can continue to support APMCs.
9th concept of assured income is going to come in near future not only for farmers but for every one...please read about Universal Basic Income...but govt have to decrease its wasting of money to implement this
"Ur video is just like""Small packet big bang""it really make my all concepts related to this farm bill clear nd also make me able to ponder about the reasons why farmers are protesting. "
"Le Congress :- we will help arrested people free of cost in court and will donate blanket in jail and will still say that ""DANGA TOH BJP KE GUNDO NE KIYA RED FORT PE"" "
Rakesh Tiket the Net worth 80Cr poor farmer. Has left the innocent farmers on boarder :D
"Its a great series but I think you missed another important dimension to the solution.We should promote FPO , this will help farmers create there own system new generation farmers can use technology to sell the produce and profits can be with farmers just like Amul."
On last Saturday yogi Adityanath and amit shah came to hyderabad and conducted huge rallies for GHMC elections. Where were the covid protocols then?
By far the best explanation I have seen on the farmer's protest.
But farmers should be also free selling to anyone they want.
I just love to see congress and Aam Aadmi party supporters arguing against Modi for their personal reasons on the other hand the response of Bhakts are also incredible.
if Modi is serious for apologies he should compensate all farmer for their 1 year suffering each farmer family 1 lac rupee... give reservations in govt jobs to all farmers.....give free electricity.... give farmers education quota in all colleges.... farmers are the only true God ...they are annadata... jai kishan parivaar... shame bjp govt
Mixing hathras rape in farmers protest is deviating from mob lynchings..
I hope farmers get the justice they deserve!
So happy to hear that farmers won
"3.If any dispute between farmer and industry then farmer can't go to court, only can go to SDM COURT, Is not this point breaking our fundamental rights because as per constitution  there is an independent judiciary system in INDIA for it's citizen."
Kick out Achedin Terrorist Govt....Jai Kisan
Farmers  who feel sad should  have co.e out to the streets to support. Why did they not?
"Superb explanation brother. You made the confused topic look so easy n understandable. If MSP is ignored, it will only be the corporate families n the corrupt government who will be benefited. N we consumers & farmers will end up exploited and looted and helpless."
"Honestly, I do support Indian farm workers due to the issue in which they are facing is similar to what happened in Mexico in 1994 in when the corrupt president of the PRI got elected, he proposed privatization in which his administration cut down on subsidies on small farm workers, collected up small plots of land and sold them to private corporations, and help corporations take control of farmland. This types of policies were disastrous in Mexico due to food prices rose dramatically, inflation became extremely high, the farm worker produced and was struggling a lot more. And a lot more Mexican farm workers fled to the US. I hope Indian Farm workers get these types of laws removed due to privatization is bad and important sectors like farming should be kept by the people not by corporations."
I would had also cleared all the roadblocks these so called farmers have made....
Rip farmers
"These laws were enforced in Bihar in 2006 and the owner of 5 acres/2 hectares in Bihar (Indian province) come to Punjab and Haryana (Indian agrarian provinces) to work as a farm labor because the MSP is not given the state since the laws were enforced. Rupees 1,800 is the MSP for rice, which is given in Punjab and Haryana but the corporates give them a mere rupees 800 price because they are exploiting the laws."
That is peaceful protest by farmers and opposition
The P M of this country clearly says that he has no interest for the Farmers of this country nor for the poor. He hails himself the back born of Corporates....If you have some goodness in you please open your mouth and speak out on Farmers' killing by BJP neta ke beta..
