"Y india is gifting dem such an powerfull machine 2 dem...dey r already weak.....by gifting dem such things ....v r making taliban more strong, dey will use same thing against us..."
I was looking for the exact issues that farmers actually have..and you explained it so well..thanks for explaining everything in a layman's language!!
Modi is rejecting the earlier setup installed by earlier govt regimes.
The current Indian pm would have agreed to the demands if these farmers had been Tea farmers
"Rahul Gandhi Zindabad Priyanka GANDHI JI, ZINDABAD Our beloved Gandhi family.. Save this country from RSS BJP God bless you."
And secondly now the people who are protesting are not farmers they are the middle man (arthi) and the anti national people because we farmers feed the whole country and doing things like that is not the work of farmers ... 
What full video? Where is the jeep running over aged farmers from behind ?
"You should ask income will be double, not crop price  will be double. And ask him how Rakesh has accumulated so much wealth"
She is just opposite to what Godi Media reporters act like .... She is just reporting the facts not acting like others 
Can experts here tell me point wise the benefits of these laws for farmers and also address the apprehensions of the farmers regarding these laws ???????
0:58 there was 90% of farmers in delhi 
"Farmers carry seeds and fertilizer . Farmers don't carry Swords, Iron rods, Stones . Only rioters and hooligans carry Swords, "
Thank u ....thanku u for such questions to the bjp spokesperson...kindly keep this kind of spirit...plz dont go against our farmers
"Farmers issue has gone too long  and  Congress and other parties taking mileage out of it , as a farmer myself   And n kernels we prefer  option  to sell out products where ever we want,  I think middle man sponsoring the agitation."
Me with the farmers of my country
There is no difference between Modi govt and talibans
"New sympathy propaganda has began, but Modiji is a problem who is true Indian by all means than Taliban"
Godi media will never show this
"Those are expensive vehicles and farmers from pujab is very rich.But others are not.If government takes back this act, then definitely we will protest.Govt.isnt fool that goes against others for the sake of just 1-2 state."
Btw farming needs reforms but what has to be guaranteed must be inserted or deleted n not entire repeal!
Jai Jawan Jai Kisan ..we alyzz with our farmers 
"In congress rule , the houses of Poor's were full of food grains and ithe essential items.  However Modi govt has reduced this quantity."
"Even French, Chinese,British  Monarch bow before peasants & farmers revolution than who is modi"
Farm bills are great. Labour laws are welcoming. 
They might be farmers But BELONGS to a particular POLITICAL PARTY that also belongs to a CASTE
"They are not farmers.... A true indian farmer would never hurt indian people... They are rioting and damaging public property, causing distortion among people, vandalising streets..... I support the government here, they should be more strict on people like this.... The farmer who died was rampaging the tractor and was tryna run over cops after some havoc the tractor turned over and the farmer died,,,, they even vandalized nation's national flag.... Shameful farmers"
"Its simple. Let farmer protest becz its their rights, and govt must listen to them becz its their duty."
Our PM cannot pull such crowd any time but farmer's unity for justice has broken the record.
Isn't  Muslim a farmer ?
Inko thokna shuru karo ya sab political parties ka tools ha crackdown karo in chuyltiyo pa I am farmer for himachal pradesh .
Punjab farmers has save india from acute hunger and now it is time for entire India take a stand for India farmers.
"2. Government middle man hatana chahti hai taki farmers exploit na ho commission se, lekin farmers ka ye kehna hai ki unhe middle man ki services ki bhi zarurat hai, transportation cost bachti hai, kyunki baar baar farmer apni produce market mei lae, agar rates naa mile to ghar vaapis lekar jae, isse transportation cost increase hoti hai aur produce kharab hone ka bhi dar rehta hai. Moisture , humidity iska bohot role rehta hai crop ko deteriorate karne mei, phir storage cost. Produce/ Crop uttarna , chardhana , har ek choti se choti  cheez ka rate hota hai, lekin ye sab middle man karta hai to farmers islye isse oppose kar rhe hain, lekin vo commission bhi leta hai , isliye government hatana chahti hai. Farmers ye bhi bolte hain ki agar kabhi unhe paise ki zarurat hoti hai emergency mein to vo middle man ke pass jaa skte hain, fertilizers kareedne hon ya kuch aur. Paise lagte hain farming karne mein , free mein nhi hoti bhai ya behen, gender dekh kar lga lena."
"It is a black spot in the history of India,  killing our own food feeders. Taking part  in the issues people are facing is certainly great.   If people want to feel faith in Congress Party it should be democratic first  and then people should have a feel that the Party belongs to people of India and not of some individuals and families."
she was never giva up...she was indian second iron lady  we are supported you mam.
"Another example is Milk which is an 8 Lakh Crore produce in India more than Wheat, potato, onion, rice and pulses put together in India, why because anyone can buy it, whoever wants to buy it can buy directly and not through an APMC, the similar thing is getting implemented in Agriculture"
Indians have little work to do ; so they all do politics!  This talk is also obsessed with political fallout of annulling the farm laws- rather than the long term consequences on Indian agricultures future & modernization of  farming practices. How will Indian agriculture-produce be competitive on global scale ??
"Is concensus possible in the parliament when we have pro-pakistan, pro- Khalistan and pro-china elements in the opposition ? Same things apply to the so called left leaning media also"
"Farmer Bills are beneficial for poor farmers. Only ""mafia kind of farmers"" are at loss so they are jittery."
Thank you for covering farmers
"Today Taliban in control of Afghanistan because India was using Afghan soil against Pakistan, so Pakistan had no other option but aiding Taliban. So India is responsible for this mess."
"What is the problem now...at starting I was also supporting farmers but when even after government removed all the previous points, now why are they protesting...."
Were the farmers in the first few weeks ready to talk to the Government?
Why dont you show the goons who have reached the singhu border to attack the farmers? Has your channel also joined the godi media club? Why dont you show the videos of the cops disrespecting the tricolour on 26th January?
"Indian don't have required numbers of Fighter Jets And Helicopters, But we gift others. Everytime in Indian development and Scientific progress there is a huge advertising by our media and vote bank. We do little but speaks more. We have economic crisis but we spend money for Parliament and Other Projects for Afghanistan. Why should we pay TAX for it?"
Educating farmers is wonderful point.
Dissent is anti-national in Modi's India; I support farmers!
Indian farmers proved India indeed a vibrant democracy. Chinese are jealous 
"Farmers' Protest., "
"What a great actor, sorry orator modiji is."
Shamefull govt how u treat that people who give u food that chapati u eat daily that the hardwork of farmer very very bad u have to understand them
"Farmers have every right to protest, but they should keep it symbolic with less people and follow the protocols.  This way the struggle also can be sustained until success.  They have shown how they count in WB elections."
This is a loss for the real farmers . Modiji did this for the nation because in the name of farmer protest the pro khalistani leader were killing innocent people .Modiji we believe in you and know that you did this for the security of common people . Modiji I support you and I am sure one day the whole country will know the important of farm laws.
Greatest living Punjabi/ Greatest living Indian is Manmohan Sir.
"I also read about the laws.  I don't find anything wrong for my farmer brothers. However, there are journalists like Ravish kumar who used to command some respect among intellectuals, they are also behaving foolish. Seriously worrying trend."
"Nicely explained except for one thing that you missed. If the PVT companies are not paying the farmer for what they have agreed on, the farmer shall get lower price, you said. But in this case the farmers can still sell the product in Mandi on MSP, you missed."
