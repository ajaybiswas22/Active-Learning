Police why you stop this is not India modi no come in the andhloan they need go please no stop same on modi no come in the andhloan
And then this policy was launched without first consulting the stake holders ( farmers and their leaders ) where while taking their fears or apprehensions in mind a better law could have been incorporated with a firm long term plan in place where crop diversification would be put in place and a subsidy provided by the centre for a fixed number of years while the transition is in place.
Sorry Modiji we dont deserve you. These laws which we required so very much had to be repealed due to dirty dirty politics of Congress.
If Ajay Mishra would a congress person then bjp may make fire all the up to make resign Ajay Mishra
"I supported farm Laws form the beginning , perhaps this is the biggest let down for Modi govt ."
Abhijit is an effective critique when it comes border strategies and technical analysis. He is an effective haemorrhoid that irritates some well deserved orifices where the sun doesnt shine. But in this issue I am glad Modiji is PM and Abhijit is an opinionated talking head.
If Indian gov takes covid 19 seriously than should hold talks immediately
"Why media giving importance to this fellow,as trial,avoid tikait for a week's time."
No farmer No food 
"2) Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, "
Agar koi celebrity's ya rich insan mar jata to sab uska dukh bante 1 2 mahine tak or social media pr video news viral hote ab humare desh ke kisan or javano ki mout hui h to sach or jhut m fase hue h 
"Anyways the basic problem still remains, Green Revolution, GM crops & food independance. Farmers grew GM crops and stopped oil seeds & millets for the additional profits it promised."
Peoples power baby. I support these farmers.
Shame on bjp government since 60 days past they.cannot take.decission don't blame the farmers they are half brain with frustration  why such government wait.till.datr
Pictures are found of Aman Nihang meeting with BJP top leaders of Punjab clicked few day before this incidents..
Why the government isn't stepping back from farmers bil
Prime minister repealed three farms laws  while wearing Pashmina Shawl and Khaadi ......Come on Dude 
"Shekhar ji, only a very small percentage of grain produced is sold at MSP, and that too from Punjab and Haryana. If the govt. (FCI) stop buying from P&H, the problem will be solved to a great extent but I am sure it's not as simple as this, so the clutter remains!!!"
I mean everyone credits the sikh farmers for repealing these laws but let's not forget the Jats who were equally vocal against these laws and jats were the main vote bank for the BJP. This is just vote bank politics by the BJP
"Huh... So you remember when Modi was praised as fighting for the people of India, like Trump? Lol"
I have been a BJP supporter for long time. Never have i been this dissapointed. The farm law was revolutionary in many aspects. Now every opposition party will think they have won.
"Every INDIAN if you are a true patriot in its real sense can be proud of a journelist like Ravishji ,for getting into the grass root and making us aware for not to be too late in keeping up our democracy."
Ye helicopter wsy bhe Pakistan main he ayega Taliban gift krdega
"I just want to thank you Sir for not being bias and bringing the truth for the viewer like us, as i was looking for this info on so many platform and everywhere i found out that either i have to be BJP or Congress supporter to listen their one sided argument, and i can't tolerate either of it ;)"
There is a reason why farmers in Haryana and Punjab are better off than other states where the open markets are killing them.
"Modiji is the best, Im a farmer enthusiast with mbbs ms(general surgery ) degree, and I support farmers bill. NDTV is the worst news channel ever"
Ab tak mai kisan andolan support nahi jar raha tha but these sikh farmer uncles motivates me am in tears how they are struggling now am with u
"This act is casued definitely by the close ally of Democratic indias first Terrorist Kotse's group, this is dangerous to India if political parties starts operating with such violoance group as part of their poilitical careers India will be ruined,, this kind of act was used largely against Arvind kejrival during election campaign, During NRC protests as welll"
I'll support the farm bills if anyone can explain how the govt is going to handle all of the below listed points (copied from a fb post). I still won't support the way govt treated the protesting farmers (over 160 died in 2 months while on protest)  -
"Farmers Never believe   Commitment of Feku , he is 420 about his commitment , we seen so many times . After bill pass only stop this protest ."
All students in our country should support to our farmers. Our students only having power to change any one. All advocates also should join with our farmers. This is my humble request for every Indian citizens
Its sad that Mr ravish Kumar had not even tweeted or posted about this incident on his social media handle.
Throw congress out of India ..Then oly india will go to nxt level ..
Jab Farmers Protest tha...Jab BJP kyu nhi milne aayi...You are Mr Choudhary saab
Yaa I totally agree with you and I raise a question that this is a farmer protest not a Hindus or Muslims protest brother Muslim aur Hindu can be a farmer  and allowed to do protest maybe I am wrong so please correct me for this
Congratulations to all farmers 
"Now a days , Farmer are protesting  in Germany. You aren't showing."
"Govt. need to have a seperate agency to act as a business resource center for the farmers in each state that they can go to; to give them business guidance, teach them business & negotiating skills etc.  "
"But I support whatever farmers want ,I don't understand laws so don't know who is right or who is wrong here."
We need system that give space for farmers to sell at their prices and take commission..(D-Mart)...
" BEST ever explanation on YT about FARM Bill and also about MONOPOLIZATION of TAXI industry by OLA & UBER -->  how it may be linked to Agriculture as well - Worth spending 30 min , if U R interested "
I support kishan... Lekin jo so called kishan ne kia usko support nehi karta. It is unfortunate to see 26 jan event by the aggressive jali kishan the are not actual bharat ki kishan.
I heard farmers & government 
I am with farmers.
This is victory of democracy. This shows that people are more powerful than government and capitalists. Govt will stand if keep people happy if they make people cry they will perish but it is too late for modi govt.
"Why not modi speak out, and accept the demands of the farmer, MLA MPS ko kharidane crores of rupee hote hai lekin garib citizens and farmers ko kyun nahi.."
This is not only the issue of farmers but to all those who eat
"All farmers who are supporting this, and those who didn't support this,"
"Make more video to show whats happening at farmers protest Because no one else is showing the same,we have believe on YouTube media..."
Still supporting the bill. Not Indian farmers just Punjab political activist not farmer.
They are not farmer they are Congress B team
Thanks to all the students ... They are also sons and daughters of farmers ...
Very good analysis of problems of farmers  Really Appreciate
No Farmers meand  No Foods
