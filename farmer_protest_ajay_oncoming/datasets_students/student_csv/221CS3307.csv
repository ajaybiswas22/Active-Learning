"The US knows that once its military presence is completely out of Afghanistan, it won't take a second for the Taliban to tear down the democratic govt of Afganistan, they must make sure that the govt stays functional otherwise it'll be disastrous for two countries first Afganistan itself and second India, cause the Taliban won't be attacking Pakistan and the taliban already said that China is its friends, so it's just India that remains in between!"
"Seems for the moment a good decision from an electrol perspective, but how long the reforms are going to getting stalled like this especially when this is  an issue only related to vested interest of some section of one state or a rich section belonging to one  caste  and rest of the india is not much worried or rather its more of a beneficial law , Let me ask a question why a particular state or caste needs to be  kept silent by   feeding with money that can be spend for greater good for the country ? Especially this will impact only the middleman and so called farmers will be still under their control and their own fate, Other states have shown better results and moved forward. Every law needs to be discussed and gov used an opportunity to bypass the parliament , I believe government did give enough explanation in parliament and most political parties have.this reform as a part of their manifesto no one have guts to implement it  , l can understand if it is related to land reforms  or if it impacts regional, linguistic or cultural aspects or major constitutional amendments except for 370 and 371, of this nation that definitely needs a wider discussion and more careful analysis,Even a law that has wider implications was passed without much deliberation or less discussion ie NEP, So according to Sekhar Sir's logic any law that impacts Punjab or Haryana or Western UP needs to be discussed explicitly discussed in Parliament and rest is fine or can be ignored, Sorry I don't take to this point.May be a bit harsh but it's a fact."
then if state govt increase in tax for new mandies which will covered (get)  as indirectly from farmers.
Farmer politics....Congress support to farmer back for politics
Haryana me sir tuta he.. UP me hota to g@@nd tod deti yogi police. 
Boht ache farmer bhaiyo
"I am with the farmers ""father of national""."
Modi govt done best work in favour of Farmers .
"Bjp is one of the nationality party, always think about pepole and country,we believe you modi ji "
"expression of thoughts in our country are motivated by religious sentiments and hatred or likeness towards each others religions , people lack knowledge yet they express their thoughts infront of the camera, we have elected BJP because most of us hate muslim community and now we have elected whom we wanted so we got to respect their decision, either choose hatred or development"
Like me  if u love  Modi ji as a Best Motivational speaker n as well as best comedian.
I am with farmers 
"And Hindus in Punjab vote for congress, bec of congress having destroyed sikh militancy which killed thousands of innocent Hindus in 80s, they havent forgotten that"
you guys are same for the country.  election harne ke dar se kanoon hi badal dia govt ne.  usko support karoge.   by hook n by crook.  n BBC has wasted  my time with this video.
"First of all, human by nature loves peace. And secondly, waging a war against any nation or group needs investment. Be it USSR or USA, today we all know what had happened to these countries. You lose people and money and nothing is gained. USA has invested 3 trillion dollars during these whole 20 years. We Indians talk about 3 trillion dollars economy but still we Indians die because of Corona. If you have lost some one or have watched news (not the Desh Bhakti ones), I am talking about NEWS which gives you information not a mentality of Hindu and Muslim then you must know how many we Indians have died during these pandemic. We Indians in 2021 are struggling, our GDP growth is the evidence of it. So, waging a war is not an option, yes no doubt if we push really hard to fight for it then we can win the war but the post war scenario will be really different, we may even become second Afghanistan in the world, there will be civil wars and protests all over the country. We Indians don't have to put our nose in some ones else matter. The best thing we can do is to remain neutral and analyse the situation as other neighbouring countries like China and Pakistan are doing. We don't want to waste money on stupid wars and give advantage to other countries like China or any neighbor country. And still if some people as I see here in the comment section who wants to show off by stating we can wipe out Afghanistan and Taliban, for your kind information, Afghanistan has seen war for the past 50 years and if you are good at history then you'll probably find out what advantages the Afghan people have in their home, mainly the geography of the country and not to forget that Taliban could do nothing without local people's support so what I am saying is Taliban has the upper hand no matter if USA or India intervene. The thing that Taliban doesn't want India to involve is because they don't want any useless bloodshed and it's the matter of their own country. If Taliban forms the government there in future then India should forget about other things and shake hands with them. Because our country has also invested 3 billions in developmental projects there. I can go on saying about all these but I don't want to because it's a matter of debate who wins or who lose, the rest depends on your knowledge and thinking. Jai Hind "
"Excellent , truthful and very bold analysis by Iyer . We need a strong leader like Yogiji. Not a leader who takes unilateral wrong decisions for the entire country. No excuses, no defending of the indefensible blunder. What a great shame. Death is better than living in humiliation ."
"What ever bjp said before, non of assurance implemented. Instead of that petroleum products, domestic gas prices  are increased to four folds."
It's just a khalistan and muslim and Congress aap sponsored game.
"01:41   Modi is an elected representative . When he sees no farmers supporting the bills but sees farmers who oppose the bills, he has to do what an elected representative is supposed to."
"I completely object ur analysis,  u may even think hoisting Pakistan flag beside India flag is also correct because they are just 0.01%"
I think govt should modified the bill properly. It have so many loop holes.
Thanks for the support farmers
IS NOT ACCEPTABLE MODIJI
In 2014 god make me pm to help farmers comedy of the year
- Delhi's people are suffering? At least they get to go home and sleep in peace. Is Delhi facing more problems than farmers on road?
Help the farmers...
I support taliban..... Yogi teri himmat he...
"On a longterm view this bill will clearly create a scenario resembling USA where most of farmland and farming is done by big companies and most of people have looking for jobs in cities, where many are living as homeless."
"Well, Half knowledge given is as much Dangerous and Threatening. Elaborate more on the Farmlaws word to word rather than assuming vague media statements as the sole truth. you also forgot to address the Khalistani (separatist) elements that have grown into these protests. "
"People in Punjab nd Haryana, don't let uninvited people enter in their villages."
"Q1. Why did Punjab farmers not shift to edible oil crops (rapeseed, sunflower etc) inspite of MSP?"
These laws are for corporates only....not for benefits of farmers
"No largely spread misinterpreted information can be cleared in a 10-15 min video. I recommend you all to watch drishti ias's video on farm bills. It talks everything legal , history and present , future , good and bad. Its 3 hours long. But it clears up A to Z everything."
"Without the Support of Local People, Afghan forces how Taliban became so strong."
Finally India today trying to shed godi media tag
"The media will never cover the full story... Just the clash... Never the pains of the farmers, old, young, men, women, every farmer is there..... Who likes to be violently splashed with cold water in winters??? Not me !!not these farmers!! These are poor people who just realised their power and right in unity....!! May God help them  fulfilling their noble..... purpose!!"
Compared with other Products So they decided to fix that Product every Farmer try to Seedling that Product-A
Pappu of now = BJP aka Narendra Modi
Beggars bluddy farmers ...even my dog will not pie on you
You did tell us how farmers were affected by the APMC act.. Very nice.. (Yeh to sabhko pata chal gaya hai) 
"china, pakistan, congress and ndtv are happy ;-)"
Atma manobal of Modi ji is unparalleled in indian history 
7) Apmc acted as a mediator though it collected tax it ensured MSP and now with companies dealing with farmers directly think about any legal battles that could arise and farmers has to fight in the court just like the recent Pepsis Indian farmer lawsuit.
There's a lot of drawbacks in the current form market where the middlemen gets bulk of the profit. It's very essential to weed them out and create a market where farmers can directly bargain with the buyers.
Violence is condemned by farmers but why to force laws which are not required to those citizens for whom these are enacted. Government is full of Highly Intelligent people so From PM TO CM need to take decision. 
"And the farmers cannot lose their land as under the new law, the land of the farmer can neither be sold, leased or used for any purpose other than those related to agricultural trade activities. "
I support farmers culprit should be arrested
"If we go by explanation in video then only best option is to make MSP a legal right of every farmer. As we are already assuming that private player will be giving better rates than what government has been offering than why not set a MSP limit before hand. As per assumption only rich farmers from Punjab and Haryana are getting benefit of MSP,  then why not pass this benefit to every farmer of country by providing legalised MSP even for buying private market."
"Under Congress rule, Kanimozhi was sent to prison for the allegations of corruption in 2G spectrum scam. Atleast Congress took action on their ministers, however here BJP's minister son has rammed onto farmers and killed 6 yet his Father remains in post. Useless Govt!!!"
"if it was congress rule now ,history would repeat itself but modi is too kind"
Pakistan should help us just like india helped bengladeshies in 1971.
"You don't respect the farmer, the nation will be cursed. Let them not eat food, tell them to eat money, material, or dung."
"Can someone explain if as he said, 94% farmers are not using APMC to sell their produce so I believe they're still being exploited regarding pricing as they do not get MSP. So why are farmers protesting if most of them don't use the present services? It seems that he didn't cover the entire situation and there is much more to it that what he's describing here."
Half of the military soldiers hail from farmer backgrounds
Congrats farmers
