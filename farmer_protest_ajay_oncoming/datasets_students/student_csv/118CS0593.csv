It was actually nothing just the anger of farmers used with wrong intentions by other political parties
Salute to all the kisaan and ravish Kumar for creating havoc in the country. Jai jawaan jai kisaan jai Congress
I am also from India. The farmers are protesting to protect their right
This guy just helped me in farm bill school homework ....
Afraid to alienate sikh farmers in upcoming UP and Punjab election.Modi cares more about his brand than any policy
Thanks modiji you just earned by vote
Pls dont abuse hard working honest sikh farmers.
"The laws favored Ambani Adani types, MSP is the solution for farmers being ripped off, Nitish did not discuss this for some reason. All farm leaders including Tikait are pro MSP"
"2021 : Farmer's protest in jan feb , may god bless the rest year"
"If this was a Pan India protest why there was no one from large rice producing states like Andhra, Tamilnadu, Karnataka, Bengal did not join and agitate for full year. This is not an Indian farmer agiataion but agitation of farmers belonging to two and a half states of India who would lose their source of. Income if government stops the mandi. Press is also silent on the funding given from extremist organisations in Canada and UK without which these agitations would have run out of steam in the long run. Press should also look into the funding received by these so called indian farmers."
"You're misguiding the peoples of India! The demanded MSP means, the minimum price guarantee of the crops! It doesn't mean Government should buy the whole crops, the GOVERNMENT Or private whoever is buying should buy in MSP."
Run it over anti farmer fellows.
#FarmersProtest #SpeakUpForFarmers #IamWithFarmers
" Don't allow these  Ambanis and Adanis or whomever you hate, to enter punjab. Even if they come, don't do business with them. I mean the farmers of Punjab are so united, (we all see that daily) if farmers decide that no matter what happens, under no circumstances are we going to deal with Private players, then to sab waise hi chalega jaisa chal raha hai na. "
Best Analysis on repealed Farm Laws.
Why this much long more than 1 years this farmers protest is running around Capital Delhi only by blocking the every human life earning in the surrounding area's
When an area is given for farmers to protest why there was need to come forward to other places. It was a great law and order situation. Last time when farmers came some infiltrators  hoisted Kalistani flag. And hurt the police officers. This is totally law and order situation. Police are protecting us and people should respect them too. Beating and hurting police officers in the name of protest is no good. They are hurting our own people.
Listen dude if you guts to reply. In bihar APMC monopoly ended in 2006. Has situation improved in bihar. Farmers sell at half the MSP in Bihar as per facts
I can see misleaded farmers on road...who don't have understanding about what is right for him in only for short term but also in long term....
"Bro if you can answer, yeah media may be taking off topic route, but what about khalistan supporters, I mean there was literally a tractor with  ""khalistan zindabad"" slogan written.  Should you or should we just ignore it? Farmers may be not happy with the bew farmers bill but but should we ignore the evil, lurking in the shadows?"
"Reason they lost this battle is because they stared riots with Anti Hindu slogans, if they stick to farmers slogan all Indians would support them"
Dont give up Indian farmers!
"Agar kissan apna pao pe kural marna chahta hein to karne do. Uneducated logo ke sath aise hi hona chahiye. This is called natural selection. Agar kissan ka income zaada ho geya to hamara bhi to cost of living badh jayega na? In fact, mere hisab se agar kissan new farm bill ke rasto mein aake andolon bhi kare to woh bill pass nehi hona chahiye."
"This is so sad  today is our republic day ,we agree that you have problem with farm bill but atleast you can stop your protest on this day ."
Farmer is lifeline of food industry
Please support our government. PM Modi and Home Minister have shown so much patience. Most of them are not farmers but terrorist and anti social elements. Just see the way they behaved on Republic Day.
Ofcourse no reasons to continue protest now. But I'm sure the so-called farmers won't move still as Tikait is excusing now.
May be TARIK FATEH is an isi agent.  I mean you never know hmari isi kahi bhi pohunch jati he Allhamdullillah or Indian media always bewaqoof hi bnta he like now 
Thats not how a real farmer would stack sugarcanes in a trolley. Clearly this is scripted. Those farmers didn't even know the laws.
stand and making farmers scape goat.
Congrats to all the brave farmers to show the right place of the ruling party.
Jai Farmers.
India Will be Save By a farmer's
Support farmers need justice for farmers
It surely is a win for the rich so called farmers who in turn fund political parties
Blood chilling lynching of innocent BJP workers reminds us of Talibans murdering their opponents in Afganisthan
"debate, discussion sounds good for the farmers indeed should have happened ideally..but history tells us ..that it will not take the good anywhere.. even what is good for the farmers.. atleast not with this opposition."
"I'm not against the farmer's protest, I'm against those violent protestors."
The only channel which presented a neutral view on the farm laws. I don't support bjp but I still support the farm laws after understanding the economics behind it. 
Those who are speaking against the farmers they watch only and only t.v.'s bogus news.
"This, in fact, is the fundamental difference between the new laws and the existing laws of most of the states that already permit private markets to operate. Some states also allow contract farming, and virtually no state bans its farmers from selling anywhere in India. But a false narrative has been created that the new reforms create one nation one market, as if it did not exist before. Punjab farmers have been selling crops like Kinnow, potato, cotton etc all over India, just as Bihar sends truck-loads of Paddy to Punjab and Haryana because its APMCs were abolished in 2006 and private markets are not remunerative."
Same thing applicable in Indian Media also.
"""Protest against farm laws, Politics or Farmer welfare"""
2020 to till how many farmers kill in this duration nov .2021 .
Hon'ble PM: No Agricultural Law will be back. It is in Favour of Farmers.
Taliban to India: We'll exterminate you frm this planet
FARMERS Don't NEED OUR SYMPATHY THEY NEED OUR RESPECT & WE OWE THEM THAT RESPECT
"2. All electric tractor, rotavator, harvester, thresher like farm equipments."
"Tell only about the kishan bill, do not explain what is saying the kishan or opposition leaders."
"Police given permits to this Rally, then why police attacked the farmers, it is shame."
3) Involve Farmer Producer Org. in APMCs to fight the cartelization.
A big salute to the ruling party & to our beloved PM Mr. Modiji. y isn't he even released any statement yet.waiting to see more such incidents?
If you can talk with farmers they will surely hear you
"Man these farmers could have gotten so much more support if they had hoisted our tri colour flag instead of using the flag of a religious community .By this we can understand that the people involved here had no motive of helping the farmers ,there sole motive was to create conflict and distrubt the internal peace within the country."
Lack of knowledge from farmers side cant be blamed on government. They should fight for themselves of laws are made for them
"How about limiting the number of farmers cropping the same crops and/or limiting area of crops for each crop. Example: limiting sugar cane crops to 1 million acres and divide that by the number of farmers doing that crop,then,they can crop something else if they have extra land left."
