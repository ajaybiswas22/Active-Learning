"Just saw Republic tv reporter trying to change the narrative by shouting ""the police is pleading(joining hands) to the farmers"""
"Modi wants Bharat to be a Hindu Estate: So let it be. Let Khalistan come into being, let Kashmir come into being , let Asam come into being; and let Nagaland come into being: What is left over is Modi's Hindu Veresh: Enjoy. What is the problem with that. Modi is a Pakistani Agent: He has more sympathy with the late mother of Nawaz Sharif than those 140 Farmers died because of the severe weather sitting in the Andolan. Shame of this type of treatment. Farmers are Andata, they are not Atanwad: But Modi has treated them as terrorist. Modi must be removed from the power and must be trialed to get a sentence of death or let Bharat be divided into 5 parts. That is the end of this RSS Terrorist hijacked Bharat and created a situation of hatred and marginalization: against the policies of Nahro, and Ghandi. This is the start of the movement of Khalistan. Now it is out of control. Jai Kisan; Jai Jawan: Jai Khalistan: is what I have been hearing from the participents of this rally."
Another clip to watch in support our Kisaan Punjab Farmers protest in London https://youtu.be/ZFCyQMbFZBc
Arey bhai bill aap liye congress ne nhi liya aapse he sawal puchge na ! Ki congress se puchege ki aapne bola tha reforms layege but aapne laya nhi ? Haad bewakoofi hai !
"Who are these dead persons, either they are farmers or others. If they are farmers,  their bank account should be checked out, weather they are beneficial of kisan nidhi or not. If they are beneficial, it should be considered that this incident is a consipiracy. High level inquiry should be exercised."
"Rakesh Tikait has more experience than many........., well done ! Rakesh keep it up."
God Yet the farmers will still loose for a fair price who  will be left in the hands of middlemen hoarders and corrupt politicians who will control the price. The rest of the farmers of India were so happy that they got a better price for their crops and accepted the agricultural laws. Leaving only Punjab farmers under pressure from middlemen and foreign funds to protest who were not even paying tax and controlled the price. Shame
"This has led to many farmers to grow only rice and wheat in rotation as only thede two crops give a guranteed income. And THAT had led to severe drop in the nurtrient content of the soil and underground water table, especially as rice is a water intensive crop. Many environmentalist belive that this farming practice is leading to desertification of Punjab, including S.S. Johl who is an agricultural econimist. "
"Instead of stopping new farm bill for 18 months let farmers experience new farm bill for 18 months and side by side committee form bring any amendment if needed on the experience of farmers then farmers will release that new farm bill is in there favours .let kotak securities kotak bank open 3 in 1 account of farmers i.e demat, trading, bank account, also teach farmers how to export  agro products of export quality skill development under kotak bank global trade account for exporters small marginal big farmers all over India .farmers will have 2nd line of income support .while getting benefit of 2nd line of income they can provide food grains of good quality"
Tumhi to bjp ko 2014 me support kiye the
It's not all about selling the produced commodity but how poor people going to buy it when the price go skyhigh
Absolutely unbelievable decision..not required..modiji yeh kta kiya apne
This is winning of farmers and opposition
Opposition duty is to stop Modi ji from doing good for country.  All past issues r example for these drama
Most Anti Poor and Anti Farmer Prime Minister India ever Had and Would never have.
"Maine government, opposition, farmers union and media (BHAAND) sbse farm bill ke baare me  suna but hr trf propeganda, prejudice, misinformation hi sunne ko mila pr yaha pr factual information hindi me mili hai .. itni aasan bhasha me smjhane k liye aapka bahut bahut aabhar "
Poor farmers will be exploited by rich farmers. Good for them. I am going to stop buying food grains grown in Punjab.
"In the name of kisan ,who are playing mischief?  Paid. agitators must get punished .Kisan are all over India but antinationals are few and doing mischief ! Great show.... great practice to make show!"
Neither useful for farmers nor customers. Jus a corporate look for middle man system. Thats it.
GODI MIDIA KO BATADO TICKET SAHAB BJP JEET RAHI HAE YA NAHI
Farmers marc ..only Sikhs hariyani and west up farmers Marc.. Excluding these farmers all farmers wants farm laws..
"He should have gone and dried the farmers, anyway it is getting cold, so let's have fun.  "
add msp as a law in bill. where is swami nathan report? where is 15 lakh. where is farmer double income. 7 saal main double nahi half ho gai hai. jimidhar kisaan finished almost in your Govt.
Indians we americans loves you stay safe :D No more fightt between Hindus and Muslims We love u all :D
"Again I think disputes are really hard to win for the farmers incase of any misadventures from these companies, unless atleast the poor farmers are given unconditional protection from exploitation in any court and at least be able to get back their expences for the loss due to the misunderstanding from the clauses, hoping the educated farmers are at least aware of the contract and what they are signing into."
These are not farmers. They are black mailers.
Congress is milking this episode like anything -  May not help in  UP election ..  People of this country are fed up with Dynastic politics  who are born politicians.  Now  this big    NAATAK  is  very much see through  and any one can see the  objective of congress  here -  UP  electorate  should   totally ignore this   Congress  Drama bhaji.
I think these bills were  milestone for farmers  and govt shouldn't took step back  some modifications can be done by govt but replenishment of bills will impact on farmers in a long term
They are the one who feed every mouth but this is the price paid by the Government of India. This is New India Of PM Modi
Now farmers are also termed terrorist... Jiska khate ho usi ko dikha
The quint CEO killed 4 farmers in up 
"keep doing, last govt change his rubbish decision on farmer rights"
"It is all very good to say that the farmer can sell anywhere but, does he have the resources to take it? Does he have the resource to fight the sharks who dictate prices? Have the laws been made understandable for them? Does he have the resource to resist corporate pressure to grow what he wants instead of what the corporates dictate? This is all a farce. Where is the infrastructure for the farmers before this law can be effected?"
Sikhs were targeted. It was not attack on farmers
Its kinda embarrassing to see how half of the people didnt even know how the farmer bills are affecting the farmers
Reject modi's govt! Reject modi's govt. May it rott in Hell .
I have a doubt Bihar say mandi system 2006 me abolish hua and we all know the situation there but Punjab and Haryana me abhi bhe hai and people migrate to Punjab from Bihar to work as labours why? Is mandi really that bad? Also dude near my place there is government storage facility of wheat and trust me its rats haven and most of shit is rotten.
Praying for well being and prosperity fo farmers
Even if you say Modi has Ego....Ex- Congress leader Manmohan agreed that MODIJI is the greatest leader...
So happy that the farmers won and gave a big middle finger to the government.
It's a deal between pakistan and taliban that the Pakistanis will help Taliban to capture Afghanistan and once it becomes successful the talibans will help pakistan to capture jammu and kashmir.
An excellent analysis and commentary by Shekhar ji. It makes this farmers issue so simple to understand.
Very correct I hope everyone understands this.The really farmer is doing farming at home.The one who are protesting are rented gunday.
we are with the farmers who are feeding more than 100 crores citizens and exporting food grains to many countries.
This is when godi media shows you false image of farmer protest SOLD MEDIA BJP IT CELL 
We always support our farmers...hats off to them
We stand with modi ji u r n true inspiration for all of us....mera Bharat mahan 
Pakistan's and pak army with sikh and farmer also
We are farmers who r very down 2 earth  not politicians like u kangna  who barks everytime. speak that much which others can tolerate otherwise u will have 2 pay for this
What if it was not done by farmers and was done just to show that farmers are wrong !?
"I would request Modiji , you also take loan and give free everything..we don't believe in future , let's think just present.. Desh ka jo hona hai..hone de"
" ""IF THESE ACTS THAT WERE DONE BY FARMERS  ARE NATIONALIST THEN TERRORIST ARE THE TRUE NATIONALIST."""
Definitely Modiji will return the 370 and 35A of indian Constitution. 
This is the best explanation I've come across for farm bills. Damn 
Aisa to supreme court was stayed these Farmer rules...ye kya hai jo Pm announce new thing...after 700+ death of farmer...insensitive Pm
