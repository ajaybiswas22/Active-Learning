"The battle may be temporarily lost, but the war is  not.My  vote always will go to BJP and MODIJI"
Such short-sighted policies will destroy Modi's credibility and knock the bottom out of BJP's vision of the country's future. Surrender to hooliganism is the surest recipe for the country's downfall.
god with farmers bcx they are hardworking person
Yogendra yadav always stand with farmers .. My first meeting jantar mantar 2017
It is anti BJP andolan. Majority of the farmers are not with this Tikait drama. 
Shame on government for not able to resolve farmers concerns even after 2-3 months
"Rahul gandhi is fearless against BJP & modi, but BJP & modi are afraid of him. Because of that BJP has paid media, social media to damage his image. But still he is fighting..."
"Even at his defeat, he is not accepting that his laws were wrong. Rather he is saying that he was right but farmers couldnt understand him."
"Election. Then, these Farmers will"
Salute the farmers!
Same here in canada. I have strong emotional attaching to my beloved ancestor land India.  Seeing government doing this to farmers is really sad.
Many Congratulations to the farmers of the Country. 
Lone from Tamil Nadu We stand with the farmers. And you should also know about the protest by Tamil farmers a few years back in Delhi.
"700 Khalistan terrorists died in Delhi farmers agitation, they're not farmers."
What I have never heard or read about these farms laws is how many farmers were opposing and how many supported it? There was no proper statistics and mostly saw centrist or leftist channels promoting agitation. If these laws were so popular then why there were no support rallies or cry now from farmers who were in favor of these laws? Also if more farmers were supporting it then Modi just gave them big slap on their face!
Andbhakhts gave lectures about agriculture to farmers 
Sarkar apni zimmedari se bach rahi hai..jesa Petrol k sath kiya.. co-op decide krenge price kitna hona chahiye.. based on demand. If demand is low price will be low. And in off season price will be out of limit. Let's see privatization of backbone of Indian economy.
"Unresearched and baseless journalism. This is typical of Vice news of late, sad story. Any Indian citizen will tell you these are politicians not farmers. Thanks for wasting my time."
The guy in green turban is correct....We r with our farmer's....Jai Jawan Jai kissan
Very pleasing speech by our Honourable PM Modiji... great personality... tried much efforts in the reforms of Farmers Law.... 5times budget increased...  welfare schemes provided to farmers.....made proposals from agriculture experts to balance the gap between the government and farmers.....but it's very sorry to say that our Honourable PM Modiji... So humbly he apologize for the farmers bill and wanna repeal it in the forthcoming winter session...... You are our great leader...
And why would any farmer stay antil their need in their farms? Why will they remain wasting their time in protests during their Sowing and Harvesting season. No farmers who would actually be suffering would wait for so long for any purpose during their Sowing and Harvesting season. Starting from 9th August and continued for 7 months and 2 days. Can any farmer stay for so long. No they can't. Then who are these? They are the fake farmers or Not an Indian. Because no Indian would create Chaos on the Republic Day of his/her country India!
"honourable sir im mba student , during study i have to give presentation and i get topic farm bill so I watch this video and this video help me to clear my concepts thank you for makeing this type of videos and please do upload this regularly my goal is not ias but im curious abut this topics so please upload this regularly"
Plz became a video on 26 January 2020 with positive response of farmer
support the farmers by bringing these laws. the previous laws is a direct reasons why 30 farmers suicide every day . I hope the police and government take strict action against the thugs endangering the peace by protesting.. we need privatization . enough of corrupt mandi system..
corporate will  take away  lands of  small farmers
Long live the farmers will win this war  don't give up hope entire world is with the farmers 
So why do Punjabi farmers benefit from MSP while the other Indian farmers do not. That's not fair either. So either all farmers should get MSP or none at all.
Farmers across india ?
Love and respect the farmers as they are very important people.
"He has Afghan roots, Taliban teachings..yet married a Jew, lead a fashionable life and using PM role to manifest his true ideologies...He needs to worry about Pakistan if Taliban willingly takes it from Pak Army, PTI"
Nuksan BJP ka nahee...gareeb kisano ka hua hai....desh ka hua hai...tax payer ka hua hai. Benefit of repeal is only for congress and communists and leftists.
We farmers just want obligatory right from Govt.not compulsion if any
5. Khalistan Flags in Farmers protest
Fun fact: Opposition protested these farm laws but this govt passed the law unlawfully. Farmers protested for almost whole the year but PM never spoke to them personally. 
Thanks  vice news...  From Punjab from India...  For showing us  .  And what  we actually  need.
Farmers will win against Modi government
I support farmers 
All these are political leaders not farmers how we get vegetables and crops if they are protesting for 9 months ?
Can't trust a single word this jumlebaaz PM says. verbal assurance of repealing the draconian farm laws is just another jumla like the hundreds already made & never fulfilled.
Media: indian farmers protest
"More over coming to farmers, remember the people or troops who were in opposition of this farm law before going happy, this are the termites of 4th generation war where people fight against internally."
It's  a true reality. We are not only loosing the farmers but also the youths who  are supporter of BJP. I just remember the line by Dr Rahat Indori who said
Farmers are farmer not terrorist
You missed out the most important fact... Farmers are not actually against bills.... They are saying just assure us MSP in writing in bill....on which govt is giving verbal assurances which is not acceptable to them....farmers are more intelligent than all economists put together...
1st time came through your channel.. nice explanation. Every thing is there. I understand both govt and farmers. Farmers basically worried for their security.
people living in big cities can not feel how the farmers are suffering
"It is always a perfect vision in hindsight. I am sure the govt will learn too. When you Look at the number of tough laws which have been passed and implemented, I do not regret one of their calculations having gone wrong. I feel that the democracy is upheld by repealing, even though it may not be in best interest of farmers."
Rakesh Tikait Uncle ji..Great Personality ! 
elected in  assembly election of Punjab  .
Modi has made his puppets as CM in every BJP ruling state
Koi kisan Nahi he sirf politics up election tak chalega.
This is what happens when farmers of any country become angry
Rakesh tiket is a biggest leader in farmer's community
Hats off to the farmers.
"Waah good from now on in india commit any crime say that you are farmer, they wont arrest you even though if they arrest contact tikait offer him a good amount he will come with his protest gang and will make you get released without even going to court,from now i guess this trend will continue and even rakesh tikait will. Make it as a business as he is earning good amount"
"Personally, I was happy about this new farm law because this motivated a new generation of young farmers who have new farming Idea's and can sell either to the government or to the big corporate buyers and make money free of tax...All dreams are shattered..."
