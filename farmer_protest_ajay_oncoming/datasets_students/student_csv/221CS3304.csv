"Dhawan Sir,with all due respect, it is very sad to see you not mentioning the price what the farmers paid for this repeal. 1 year long( i.e 360 days almost just think of it sir,360!) , Around 700 farmer's died(some committed suicide leaving behind a suicide note hoping there step may persuade the government about the protest).. 700 farmers sir,700! Summers,winters,harsh rain,Police brutality,Water cannon,tear gases and what not??????!"
"Why Farmers still Committed ""Suicides "" before Laws ?"
Farmers don't need our sympathy . They need our respect & we owe them that respect :- Maharshi actor Mahesh babu
"If this bill is passed. Adani and another big player will make big storage units to control prices. In the long run because of the removal of JAMAKHORI ACT the prices of grain will increase a lot and normal people will suffer and the poor even more. So its not just a bad thing for wheat and rice farmers, is it bad for everyone, other than few billionaires"
One year of convincing farmers was nor enuf? Press were friendly
"So you proud  to  modi asking sorry to farmers  come forward  himself  for farmers, and he should be win  UP"
Aare sir abhi election ka time hai... Isliye sarkar busy h parchaar mai...
It looks like he did it intentionally. My heart breaks for those farmers who died
 WE MUST SUPPORT FARMERS.
"Shame Delhi Police, Republic Day K Din Jaha High Security Honi Chahiye, Uss Din Koi Lal Qile Ma Chadh Gya, Aur Aaplog Kuch Nhi Kr Paaye?? A Big Big Failure Of Delhi Police.... Agr Farmer Protest ka Ya Haal Ha To Agr Terrorist Attack Hota To Aap Kya Krte??"
"So called protesting farmers are like that really annoying aunty who will criticize you even when you are right... Ironically only opposition leader's fb profile had the farmers protest logo with them.. farmers had no problem but opposition has. So on a sad note, now that laws are getting repealed only farmers will suffer and not opposition "
Died Farmers should get compensation
2) - Farmers (empowerment and protection) agreement on price assistance and farm services act -
Farmers are also citizens of India. The govt. should have to understand the reason of protest and people who eat today should thank a farmer. Violence is not a way to solve problem and farmers well know it. But indian govt. is not ready to confess its mistake.
Rakesh tikait g real hero of farmers
O bhai delhi me kisan bethe hi kaha tha ...sab to khalistani or rapist the....
Black day for real farmers
Proud of you.Godi media vs reality.
Support for farmers protest
You pose a question if farm bills are right or wrong but you present the facts with such biased inclination that the bills seem right which isnt the fact
We are the ones who gonna buy food produced by farmers 
Jai.ho Shri yogi ji bold and best CM of India
Thank you BBC for put farmer voice
Salute to those who were present there in Mandi House.It high time we all should show solidarity with the farmers.
"There is an India represented by Tamil Nadu, and another by Bihar. They are far apart on human development, but both belong to the same India on electricity and drinking water.The fifth National Family Health Surveys findings make it clear yet again that there are indeed two Indias, as the comedian Vir Das has said in his own way. The India represented by Tamil Nadu has less than a third of the diarrhoea cases reported from the India represented by Bihar. It also has only 40 per cent of the infant mortality rate, and 60 per cent of the fertility rate. The obverse is that Bihar has only two-thirds of Tamil Nadus ratio for literate women, or doctors per 1,000 population, but a 50 per cent higher ratio of stunted and wasted children."
Concession and benefits of agriculture should be given to only small farmers those income below 5 lakhs per annum. All rich farmers having income more than 5 lakhs to be included in tax scanner. And progressive tax to be charged. 
"Punjabis protested,  they are called Khalistanis."
"Addaaaniiii who was waiting to earn profits by these laws, waits to shoot these farmers, lead to their death, and thinks that he is the real farmer!! #nooffense"
Good way of delivering your out view....but never thinking about doing good to the farmers....did u give any solution about the problem....

Bjp out from india
First of all my sincere respect and support to farmers
"Indian Government can't do anything, farmers themselves have chosen to remain poor!"
"Pre-planned agitation, find the solution on coming discussion between farmers and GOI. Thanks."
Poor DK Singh. His leader has let him down. This man did not once mention the deficiency in the bills and why farmers opposed them. Just kept saying that they were reforms. 
"The police and government has been polarizing farmers protest,"
modi also asked MSP as CM nothing  wrong if farmers ask
Pm Narendra Modi has been  repealed three farmer's law on the occasion of Guru Nanak jayanti.
"Sir 700 people died, his party netas call farmers as terrorists and jihadists. Modi didnt even give a single speech sadly stating it. Like amarawathi farmers, farmers all over should start a walk to each and every state and publish about rest of laws, loss caused to farmers by it and fight till each and every farm bill is repealed. Farmers should be supported by each and every state government and help them acehive it."
You make us crying dear   !!  Seeing is believing    after 1984  sikhs was portrayed  as separatist  or khalistanis  bcz of the media wasn't  showing  the real pictures  !now this generation  has seen what kind of peoples are these 3% who always stood for INJUSTICES  whether its on them or someone's  else  this is a teachings of our gurus
In our telangana state govt directly purchase from farmers 90% of state crops on MSP also gives free insurance of rs 5 lakh free electricity rs 1000 per acre investment
May our farmers be blessed...
Entire country should support farmers .. bjp government is a coward and not even want to face farmers ..
"Did you get all this wisdom after the bills are repealed, or have you made any video before suggesting your favorite leader what to do"
"Until I saw this video clarifying the Farm laws, I was totally confused as to what this ruckus is about. Thanks Amit uve put it in perspective. But the word selling for profit is not very apt. Can anyone SELL his/her product at less than or the same price at which they have bought ??? or spent to produce. Doesnt the Farmer/Producer add his margin and sell ?? Selling at extraordinarily high ""MARGIN"" is called profiteering, which the essential commodities act is supposed to control. But selling at a profit is what makes the business engine run, at every stage of its transfer of ownership."
I have a doubt. In this video you have mentioned that the APMC doesnt buy at MSP but in the video of farm bills you have mentioned how APMCs are used by big farmers to sell at MSP?? How?
This is the death of democracy. How can you pass a bill without discussion. Every members want to repeal this bill(last being bjp) but what's the point in debating after the bill is being passed? Speaker should have allowed debate first may be for an hour or two then called for voting and repealed it. That could have been simple.
"I'm a Bangali, Kolkatan!!  Purely supporting farmers!!!!  May be this is the first time,  I'll get to see the real INDIAN power-parade this year...  Plz  do show us the parade. Mujhe pehele bolna para me Bangali hu to show my respect & love to my sikh community. Hum sab ek sath hain. ""JO BOLE SO NIHAL"
Why only hindi speaking farmers are protesting?
Support the farmers!Farmers feed the world!
"Farmer disputes (market prices, contract farming etc) matters cant taken up by the court. Only up to SDM. Seriously? So basically farmers have to rely on corrupt SDMs to solve their matters with corporations like adani & ambani."
Farmers have won bless them 700 have died and now on our Guru Nanakji gurprab modi as done a u turn asking the farmers to go back home but farmers will stay until they get in black and white 
"Jai mulnivasi Jai bheem Jai Tipu Sultan Jai Kisan, morcha ke sath hit counter code of conduct for PM r Reader go head with love and life election commission"
i fully stand with the farmers
10 lakh people participate this protest ..bt national media not cover it properly...shame on indian national media..they cover only negativity..... good lalantop
