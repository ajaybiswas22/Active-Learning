"Crazy it is now , it's really sad to see farmers protest is being destroyed,"
"Going by your own logic india should also should declare itself a Hindu nation and verbally mention we will take care of all minorities like Taliban, Pakistan and Bangladesh. We all know then how do they take care. Why leftists eyes have closed their eyes on what happened to minorities in this countries although they were part of india at some point. The only difference between india and these countries is that Islam is in majority in these nations. If Indian Muslims really celebrate Taliban victory, do you think their thought process is any different. Why don't you blame their Dharmik chashma because your chashma doesn't see it."
Modi government needs this kind of protest because they ignore Farmers. Ab sab chhanga lag raha hai mujhe. Jai Hind Jai kisan
"saw it on another channel, where one speaker asked - if farmers were to get MSP guarantee for all their produces, which would be x% above their investments, - then why would a golgappa and bhelpuri vendor not ask the same? they should also get msp guarantee and govt should buy their golgappas !!"
Poor farmers eventually got succeeded their passionate  efforts against the Law has set an example for other who are struggling for their rights congratulations to farmers and their supporters and sympathisers
Who said that they are not farmers  u can't hire 3 lakh people with one lakh tractor so use your common sense and come out of this modi bhakhti
Godi media not showing this interview on television because this channel is aaj tak digital only for social media
Great job students  please use social media to spread farmers voice to the world
"farmers launched 'SIM Satyagrah' on Thursday. In a social media campaign, they destroyed Reliance Jio mobile SIM cards in protest against corporates over the contentious farm laws."
This devil only said in previous video to talk with Taliban as solution...and criticized Afghanistan investment. Now challenging Modi to ban Taliban... that's mean he's Pro-Taliban...and having strong confidence on Taliban and Hakani Network...he will support Palestine but not Afghanistan...you can see the hypocrites level of this  man!
"India can only send resources to help Afghanistan,  they know if they send Army they all will die.  Thats the taliban power. Then all will say Lund Hind"
Bro I like your content it changed my perspective 360 degree but plz do one video on how young generation is influencing by this scenario of our country.i was a fan of modi but after I check my facts as u regards to do them I realised the scams he is doing to influence the youth..all I want from u to direct the youth...and bhai pls tell the young generation not to provide fuel to the concept of hindu rashtra...we r all one and that should be the same no one is going to get benefit from the concept of only one relegion in the whole country bec we all are divers
Now AP&TG farmers will suffer because of Punjab. The decision must be given to states to repeal or continue farm laws.
"Until Pakistan remains as a sovereign nation, so will the Taliban. The two are attached at the hips - that is the sad reality."
#WeStandWithFarmers
Finally a geniune report about the farmers protest! Thanks Vice news
"In present case, big farmers for some perceived losses have organised the farmers who are supposed to benefit from the reforms. Moral: Disturbibg status quo has its own perils."
"PM Modi is quite good at communication. This matter really needs to be solved by proper discriptive communication and must remove any misconception if farmers have any ( cause we know their is opposite parties as well), bcoz this protest is not good for the farmers as well.."
One farmer died just bcz of his own mistake im happy one filthy soul departed
"India is an agriculture country, most of the people even before Independence happened, earn their livelihood through farming, we get most of our foods because of farmers. After seeing all this Gandhiji would be disappointed"
Acha hota UP and Punjab election pahle ho jaate . 
"Already several other companies are doing contract farming in india. Pls enquire wth other food companies. It is good for farmers, if more companies are coming to buy their crops, so that there will be more demand. "
20% farmer opposing 80% supporting this bill let that sink in
"There is no permanent friend or permanent enemy in diplomacy, only permanent interest. India should start accepting the Talibans and work in hand with them"
What about making the selling price to consumer and Msp interlinked at the backend and monitored by government. And only digital payment allowed to pay farmers for  transparency in the transactions
I support indian farmers protest 
WE ARE HARMING THE NATION BY THESE COMMENTS -- MODI JI IS DOING NO ONE WOULD HAVE EVER IMAGINED -- NEED TO HAVE SOME PATIENCE !
There can't be any complacency on the canceling of farm laws which were not there.Responsible policy makers must bestow sincere efforts to protect the farmers from natural disasters practically avoiding slogans
"just insert in the same law that MSP IS MANDATORY AND IF ANYONE TRIES TO BUY FROM FARMER BELOW MSP ,THEY WILL BE SUBJECTED TO THE CONTEMPTS MENTIONED IN LAW. (this is clearly mentioned in FSA ACT ALSO) "
"Take respect farmers,for your courageous stand to exact your rights, preserve livelihood.Hope the Government listens to your demands as you farmers the only growers defying cold-rain-heat for a country and the world alike to feed on.Without farmers,no choice but to starve."
Please post more videos on farmer's protest mainstream media is ignoring such a big protest .
"The reforms will also sound death of the rural development in Punjab and Haryana, which is sustained on market fee and rural development cess. Punjabs annual income from these sources is about 4000 crores and it is used to fund rural infrastructure, particularly 5000 Kms of village link roads, agricultural research, storage godowns etc. The new laws do not provide an alternate source of revenue for the loss of this income as these take away the power of states to impose any fee or cess, by whatever name called."
Bjp party ab tera kya hoga. bjp party not support Indian
"Well explained.  The reform looks good in paper, but opening up the market to private players doesn't guarantee and a smooth transaction. The issues of APMC price management can also pop up when big private corps step in. Similarly the misuse in contract farming can also be suppressive to the farmers. The farm laws arnt perfect, however they could have been sent a parliamentary standing committee before being passed hastily without in depth expert inputs."
Good morning my dear brother arbind kajeriwal. Ji  please help all farmers please god bless you
None of these politicians are for the nation or farmers... all of them are well aware of it but......
Rakesh tiket urf terrisrst comedy achi kar Leta hai 
"Corporate is not evil but informal one .    Farmer need to understand . As a license trader , farmer use any type of fertilizer and not do proper testing and not event want reduction . Sector need to be demand driven not supply driven .  At the end it a trader responsibility not farmer (sad reality) , we pay more tax . They not even grade their products ."
"Central government should think about farmers(kissan), not about Mukesh ambani or adani(business class)."

"BJP need not worry about any negative electoral impact and in fact it is bound to gain very positively a lot electorally both in the long and short run. But the crucial and some what the urgent need of the hour is that BJP should deploy its best communication and campaign skills in dispelling \ countering \ negating the poisonous, extremely negative and a very wide inimical campaign started by the many rich farmers and very rich arthriyas (middlemen) in absolute collaboration with some political parties that are against the BJP against the new 3 farm laws in order to influence the poor and marginal farmers of Jats and of India also."
If reforms do not come to agriculture space and Punjab then our agriculture  is going down the drain. And in terms of Punjab there will not be any ground water left in 10 years if current practices are not changes . Shame on these farm protest leaders
Congratulations  Taliban wish you all the best we love you  Pakistan zindabad

"Ok listen bro, let me show you a mirror. Reliance is coming down in retail business and at the same time farm bill has passed? Reliance will need raw material, where will it come from, farms right? How will they get material at lower lost by the farm law, isn't it? For eg. ITC they almost have everything, to make cigg they have tobacco and that's what reliance wants to do but at lower cost and hence FARM BILL."
