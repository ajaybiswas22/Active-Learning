Hindu and Sikhs jat won but farmers lost
Great sir..  Aap kisano ke liye fight kro.. All Indians are with you ..salute you
Let's stop calling them kisan and call them Khalistani terrorists now
"However, im not afraid of conundrums coming in my way subjected to farm bills...will explain them all...."
Full support to  Farmers.
"Questions - is there a path for these middlemen/wholesaler to procure at 800 from farmers and sell it to government at MSP calling themselves ""farmers"", making a profit? Does the government do checks on such spurious trades?"
Good going. Support farmers. One day everything will be better bcoz God is watching. It's a very long protest ever in the Universe seen. Kisan union zindabad 
Farmers are the backbone of India and now it's time show solidarity for them.
If MSP is made a law then traders will have to pay it and not the government. BJP is protecting the traders and not the farmers.
There are lot of Benefits to the farmers they just cut the rich middle men who exploit farmers these are rich middmen who are protesting
Very well explained .  It is clear that the common man must stand with the protesting farmers for his own good.
"*Koi Yeh Na Soche Ki India Ko Hi Problem Hogi Taliban Se Pakistan Mein Sabse Bure Din Bhi Aa Sakte Hain,So We Pray For Both The Countries Protection *"
"who says we dont have leaders ? Mr. Rakesh Tikait is one such leader, better than those presently in Government"
This fellow is well oiled by funds elsewhere that he can protests wherever directed by the sponsors. Not farmers but trouble makers but only restricted to one state and a portion of the middlemen.
Tikat is never going to  be happy.  What has he done for farmers with his black money. Or helped farmers.  Nothing. He is mixed with anti elements. So nothing can happen..
Reforms are necessary in agrarian sector but it should be beneficial to the farmers.
"Farmer sowed seed, God Jesus n bible is a seed of god's word satisfied ur soul by His death n ressurrection. C 'Bible' in google!!!....."
"Sudhir , Shambhu Border v ek hai Pakistan and India ka interstate Border point hai ."
Driver should have killed by the farmers no matter what the consequences
"I hope the  farm laws stand and don't fail.i wonder if the civil rights movement or even India's freedom had been fought when social media was around ,would we be living the same lives.We need to step up our game against information warfare"
India is way behind in information warfare....we are loosing information warfare against china and pakistan externally and internally too...we are not able to pass the massage to general public.
Thanks to all opposition leaders inIndia who supported kisan movement
Waiting for tippini after repeal of farm laws news.
"Sir, why can't the government implement these laws in all states except Punjab and Haryana?"
"You explained the situation in case of Punjab and Haryana farmers but overlooked the other wheat and rice growing states and the quality of these crops which Govt has to procure is not exportable too. Good video but it overlooks so many other points which we can not overlook if farmer's and farming conditions in India has to improve. Farmer's health, use of chemicals in farming, day by day depleting and polluting water table and farmers growing only few types of crops which brings less price because all are growing same crops. Plz make another video keeping in mind all those aspects too."
Zee news hamesha bjp ka support me in khara h
All nationalist people's should vote &  support to BJP for national favour 
Why this slow version video instead actual version? The Actual version is worse attack on innocent farmers.
"Modi can never help anyone except richest Indians. Good initiative, this should continue till PM resignation."
Very Happy n bigest salute to Unity of Farmers. U all are saviour of democracy n guide to whole nation.
"Thank you Modi ji, article 370 hat gaya warna pura Pakistan Kashmir me bas jata. India should not trust anyone and do anything for our safety."
Why don't you do DNA of BJP or Modi
Literally abi tk ki worst ruling government h BJP.
"It is just a matter of time. BJP has already lost Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand and parts of UP. People do not trust BJP at all here."
Thanks for farmers news
"Modi ji I'm feeling so sad, low and defeated (reg. farm laws repeal), though I know you're the most intelligent, most selfless, nationalistic and most experienced leader in the world..."
Pls keep posting videos covering farmer's protest. 
*I RESPECT AND SALUTE INDIAN FARMERS PARTICULARLY WHO FAUGHT LIKE ROCK SOLID*
Thanks to haryana Western UP and Punjabi kissan..atleast MSP pe discussion to hone laga.. implement ho ya na ho atleast logo ko pata to Chala
Victory of farmers against ravana
Rakesh Tikait  Sir Great Farmer Hitaishi
modi said us  Khalistan but he apologize
For Pakistan in the East with India: LOC means Line Of Control...but in the West with Afghanistan: LOC means Line Out of Control!!! 
Arrest Chadhuni for inciting the farmers.
There are many other problems not only associated with farmers but also with the common man..price inflation etc..
"The people who attacked others cars and beat them are not farmers , they are hooligans and they belong to just one place which is prison.."
Long live Indian farmers. This is the true Republic Day parade! Modi government should step down in shame!
Jay Farmers.....!!!
"55 days of kisaan strike ,sitting in chilling cold with their families it's high time that central govt should listen to farmers mann ki baat and scrap 3 farm bills!"
Really impressed by the resolve of Sikhs and farmers.... salute to them
"Primary reason is security concerns. Pakistan's ISI taking advantage of the unrest & disquiet caused by Farmers protests, reignited the fire of Khalistanis and offered tie up with Islamist extremist groups in India and abroad. All this was creating security concerns, hence withdrawal of farm laws is a small price."
Thanks to BBC for coverage of farmers protest.  Now all know why people are in Delhi for suspension of farmer bills they are not terrorist.  Govt is trying to turn the agenda nd not fulfilling the demands of people of India.  Its not democracy its dictatorship.
# godi media ...why dont u identfy who was that man .....and show one program in his name .....rss gundas......
We always with farmer
"Our support to students community for supporting   our Indian Farmer's. Three cheers for students. Community.  Jai Kissan Jai Jawan, Kissan brother's Zindabad"
