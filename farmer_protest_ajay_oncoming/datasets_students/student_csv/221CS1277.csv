"PS- Unfortunately, More than 150 farmers have died, already. Some committed suicide, some died of cold weather while protesting on out skirts of Delhi."
Congratulations to all Farmers whose dedication have resulted in reality..
Long live the Farmers 
"This is only a partial information what you have provided with your expert ,I wish to know how much wheat or rice is being produced annually in India and the farmers who lend their land for these products, what do they charge annually & why they are producing these two products only. If government has come out with one market one nation ,there is a big purpose behind it , which you must learn before showing your intelligence. Even your expert has no knowledge of actual problem which hit's not our earning only but also hampers the progress of country. All governments tried in their periods to bring these law's but we're not in majority to do it. I further add government is not averse to Mandi's & has further earmarked huge funds to modernise these Mandi's & to increase in number where ever it's needed .Now  All other bullshits that corporates will dominate in pricing or will take the land of small farmers, in that regard it's impertinent to mention , contact will be of crop & leasing out land, that's a separate act for that purpose so fear at all of losing land. Now main problem of Government is of buffer crops of both items of wheat & rice produced in India which unmanageable by government & it's agencies that's why I asked to tell me how much of both have been produced in gone year of 2020. To your surprise it was 10,718 lakhs quintials of wheat & 11,417 lakhs quintals of rice , what's the storage capacity required to be for keeping such huge quantity of both. People & opposition parties even told many lies to public about the storage that was got constructed by FCI from Adani Group in late 1990s & 2000to 2010. Even All these storage capacity are negligible in face of what is being produced of both these crops . It's for farmers to produce & sell both commodities but huge difficult for government to carry such stocks for number years where as it's shelf life is few months only & may be extended to a year or so with pesticides & fumigation . Production of wheat is nearly 400% more of what India needs annually & production of rice is more than 200% of need of India & government wishes to change the crop mix only & that will have to be done for the benefits of people of India. We only important adible oil's & further more it can be changed to cash crops which Punjab & Haryana have left in past about 30 year's.If you have any talent now suggest remedy of it rather than misguiding the people without much knowledge of true problem."
"AAP govt should form national party all over India,and start protest with farmers adding EVM voting ka mudda."
It is a very wrong decision. It shows that the government is weak and lacks the willpower to go through reforms.80% farmers who were supportive of these laws have nowhere to go now.It shows how hooliganism has won.Its distressing. Nobody has won but Nation has lost a big opportunity.
I feel very sorry for Indian citizen when you have people in the government telling people do more crime and you will be in the government high position after you come out of jail very shame for BJP
"WAh very nice truth is told. Yes haramies party congress left,aap,ncp,sibsena,sp,bsp,.they don't want Kishan is coming forward."
OK with your reasoning for Bihar. But does the less market price led to the change in cropping pattern in Bihar? And does that helped Bihar's farmer monetorly?
Why to have elections when we can frame laws or repeal from roads...dissolve all parliament and let some brokers and opposition decide what to do
Which also proves that the farm law is good and -ley impacting the brokers. One more the farmers are rich ( or being funded)  and have the resources to go on protest.
I will always sapot to farmer  
Farmers - MSP can't by guaranteed. Guaranteeing MSP means the money goes from taxpayers or Corporates pockets without any quality evaluation. A MSP range per year can be proposed based on estimated demand by Govt. (Govt.and Corporate can use data analytics and set MSP range based on historical and projected demands and make the process transparent and visible) but Kisan cannot go to court when MSP is not within the range. And no guarantee. Nobody knows accurate regional demand in advance.
"We must force n make bjp open in all members ,bjp knows only one thg making fight b/w hindu n muslim"
From this video I dont find any violent protest. Though I have no full coverage or information of this protest. However from what I see on the video it shows that peaceful protesters been stopped by police and when not stopped they have beaten up brutally.. If this is the case then I condemn the action.. If the situation was different than what it show then I would not comment... But one thing what I understand is that conducting peaceful protest is our right and no one in this country can stop us from doing that.. N one more point I want to highlight that if tomorrow farmers stop farming and stop production then humko ghar pe sab ugake khana padega.. This is a message for andhbhakts.. Think before blindly supporting some one or and ideology..
BJP neta determine to finish farmers.
Only from punjab and haryana and maharashtra
Guarantee this farmers attacked the car first and when they tried to run these people cried victim
Very nice explained.  The bill is not good for farmers
Request with everyone pls support these farmers. I m from Patna Bihar

"Report put more emphasis on journalists, instead of farmers, reports are trained to do so,  shame on media, they dont say anything about police, army, all are getting paid to do soooooo"
Salute To Our Great Prime Minister Mr Shri Narendra Modi Ji   & Our Great Chief Minister Mr Shri Yogi Adityanath Maharaj Ji 
Waoooooooo. little farmer Hero. Mind blowing...JAI jagannath swami bless you.
"Farmers has strong immune system , no need of mask,no need of sanitizer , no need of distancing and no need of vaccines. Please update how many people's died after taking vaccines in India?"
I love Godi media for their dedication for Government....WE SHOULD APPRECIATE THEIR swami bhakti....
Farmers Protests was peaceful
"Rich people in our comfortable homes: I support hard-working farmers' protests against injustice after injustice, but... (moral high ground speech against violence)"
*The only thing we can do it is* just wait for next election without forgetting these events which is destroying our India.
"U,re farmers bjp murdabaad that,s fine no issue but why khalistaan jindabaad ?? .."
Sadly  they are doing everything for their own benefit not for our farmers
2) Before this ordinance also any farmer can sell his crop to any state. There ia no restrictions. Many of Haryana farmers sell their wheat in Narela Mandi....
"Farm law was passed without discussion and repealed without discussion,what is the used of Members of Parliament?.why not let Modi alone sit."
This is Government Who did Announce  2015 At November 8   the same  super PM Modi telling media that devaluation of currency who suffered poor farmers  and people in villages so modi said give me ninty days  if  not I resign but till today his not slow  the currency problems  farmers bill pass with in twenty four hours  Announce  they has parliament. also opposition  did not listen to them because only thing they majority in parliament they did not want  know  anybody they  the KING
"3. INDUSTRIALIZATION: it may not be agriculture itself but can surely improve the life of a lot of people who were in farming previously as it will create job opportunities for millions to come out of agriculture and shift into comparatively higher value manufacturing as service sector is legendary bad at providing enough job opportunities especially to a population as large as ours (I hope you can relate it to india) and agriculture though extremely important for ""LIFE"" is very bad as a source of ""LIVELIHOOD"" so we should focus at trying to improve productivity of a farmer so that less and less farmers can also feed the nation and shift the rest into comparatively higher value manufacturing industry."
sir please make a video on taking back of farmer bill by govt. please...
Kudos to the Modi Government for these fundamental reforms. All praise to our Prime Minister and his team for having the will to change the parasitic status quo in the Farm Sector.
after being hit by police and army .....farmers still fed langar to  hungry police and army  
Indian army will blow taliban
Why are we saying farmers are against this bill.? Farmers from Punjab and haryana doesnt represent All Indian farmers.The farmers from state which take maximum benifit of MSP and Mandi system are opposing due to introduction of parrallel system..
I think farmers should are responsible because they should not go to the red Fort
Why can't the PM go and talk with Farmers and explain this??
As always govt is befooling farmers to satisfy their own political and corporate interests
Lakhs of farmers can't be wrong.
#TALIBANI_FARMER
"the journalist is kinda nervous about ""the violance"". did she ever stopped to consider that dispossessing farmers to the benefit of corporations involves violence?"
I always stand with farmers

"It's a miserable condition for India, but that tractor drifting skill is one helluva ride."
BJP: PM Modi doing everything with his might to stop the farmers from entering Delhi. Government digging the roads to stop farmer protests.' Irony..
These guys aren't listening to farmers but look at the bandobas they done and how much can this all has been cost...??
