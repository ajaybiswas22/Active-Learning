It's setback for farmers development
We farmers oppose this antifarmer. Bill
"Love, care, equality& respect to every jeev atma or every human beings. Hindus also mard soo come out in the favour of farmers. Every religion and every one supports farmers because farmer are ann data. Farmers feed everyone food, vegetables to every one. Farmer are also God."
"Not happy with Taliban success, but on a lighter note, is this means Pakistan defeat super power and NATO??"
"Farmers bill will be benefited to farmers, the commission agent's no more role in selling of farmers crops. "
"6. Most of the people were clueless in the protest, jinhone farm bill padhna to dur, inka mtlb bhi nhi pta tha, aur baithe the tents me.."
"Thank you farmers for showing millennials, on Internet they can only Troll, real results can be brought on ground with real efforts."
"These are not farmers they are rioters,a farmer knows his values."
"momentum to reforms lost, just like in 91, no govt will ever touch agriculture for a decade or two, the ones that have come from Punjab and rejoicing, soon will be faced with a dilemma when the water beneath their farms runs out (almost at critical levels) and a situation of acute drought is forced upon punjab and haryana due to the excess production of wheat and rice. the age old tradition of freebies to continue!! to the one's that are rejoicing in the comment section and saying BJP has lost, you have lost, our future gen. has lost, all leaders of all parties have enough money to live 7 lives abroad, the lower and middle income group will be left here to starve."
"Government's response has been fervently against repealing the laws, same as the farmers refuse to buckle. So the government is also maintaining peaceful resilience. Politics aside, no one has been harmed."
I am don't understanding that the only farmers of haryana and Punjab protesting
The first food vlogger to visit farmer's protest well done 
No votes for bjp these elections he is such a clown
Why government is testing patience of farmers...
Nice effort to decode farmbill 2020 by Mr.Pratik Gupta.
Home minister of UP should resign for justice in this incident. He may resume post after justice is delivered to farmers.
This is the victory of old farm laws. Better to implement those laws for 2 to 3 years then we can find output. 
Everyone is like they are khalistani......do ya even know the history of Sikhs????n dont fuckin say that they want to divide India coz that's what RSS want.....n if uh can stop then do it...otherwise dont say that they did this or that
Then is this farmer's flag?
I support the farmers
"Not everything should be seen from the perspective of economics. Such thought process is good for Western countries, especially the United States where the current liberal economic policies originate from. India is a land of 1billion plus population, majority of whom are farmers. Additionally, every state has its own manner of farming depending on the weather patterns, cultural dynamics and set historical patters. Now when economists such as the interviewee try to impose their western economic models, where agriculture is practised in a different manner, they are bound to get disappointed. In India, every state should have it's own farm laws, customized to the local farming practises. We should not always look to the west for progress but can develop our own model based on our circumstances."
"ye kisaan akele nahin hain....""WO BHI HAIN JO IN FARM BILLS KA SUPPORT KARTIEN HAIN""....These Laws are good for the farming.....Reforms are needed..."
This is the worlds largest democracy in action. No other country manages over 400 million farmers in a democratic process. Hopefully better outcomes evolve over time.
But you didn't say what happens to the farmers if the farm laws are adopted.
The truth on the ground is that people like this law and the Government after looking at the acceptance level they are not trying too hard to resolve this issue. The reason behind that is that these so called farmers are only asking for repeal and once a decision is made and if it is good for the Nation then Modi is not going to repeal it no matter how much this escalates.
Respect to all the farmers who have worked hard to get their rights back in this modern era 
CONTRACTUAL FARMING ( for any issue farmers can reach only to SMC AND DC of the district)
longlive farmers
FSP - Farmers Spot Price
This is the saddest and most wholesome protest ever done in India . Respect to the farmers and kudos to the Scoopwhoop Unscripted team .
-why is government doing conferences all over india but not to the farmers in Delhi?
Why is Rajdeep not talking about these so called farmers who were wearing Bhindranwale shirts? Which farmers were Bhindranwale supporters? This is all a ploy to create instability in country!
"Hi Abhi, Niyu, you are really doing great work! I believe this video can be an eye opener for farmers, but they might not understand all the terms.. please create this video in simple language understandable by the farmers..."
"the govt can launch a scheme where farmers get a fair price for their land. This will also be useful in bailing out farmers. Then, the govt gives the farmer a fixed salary for producing crops. This way, farmers are ensured  a fixed income even if the harvest is not good giving them financial security. The govt gets all these crops and then sells these to the traders at the govt price. This way the govt can control market prices .Both the farmer and the consumer benefit from this."
Not only punjab haryana and up 
"A website to aware farmers, connect with other famers, and a feature to find right price for thier crop. I am going to make this site. "
Laws were not good sir..govt not even care about small section..  every farmer were  going against day by day.. that's why this step is taken...
"Panjab and Haryana only protesting farmers because other state farmers don't even know bills, when they come and passed"
Indian Farmers Should be definitely taught About this bill
OMG ! Pardon me for voting BJP in the last elections on the behest of Badal Dal.
#FarmLaws_InjusticeByModi
"What the agitating farmers could not achieve  by their prolonged agitation, could be done by Capt. Amarinder Singh. I think it is largely the efforts of the Captain coupled with election politics ,which led the Central Govt to reconsider the issue to pave the way for Captain's victory in Punjab election. No political party however can claim a role in this issue. Enough hints were already dropped by him in advance about the course, the Central govt needs to take.But how a small fraction of farmers have become a block to larger section."
"They introduce bills in favour of Industrialists like Adani (against whom already a lot of opposition is there in Rajasthan, due to mines controversy and Australia also) and effect poor farmers. But we dont speak as it doesnt effect us."
"Punjab farmers had done a wonderful job in the initial years of the Green Revolution but gradually , massive subsidies , no income tax and MSP, free electricity , wrong entries of Khud Kasht- Actual Tiller status in Revenue records by corrupt Patwaris etc ,.turned these once hard working farmers into super middleman and brokers for small farmers / Artiyas - a sort capitalist -absentee land lordship exploitative form of functioning . . New farm laws gave small farmers to an opportunity become independent ."
"""The farmer is the only man in our economy who buys everything at retail, sells everything at wholesale, and pays the freight both ways.JFK"
as every bill has a some pots and holes this bill too has it...but regardless of all that i think i would help farmers indeed in globalising their products...and they would not be just confined to APMC but to global market...so lets see how it goes
I support the Farmers.
"He tested the water's, did everything to hurt the farmers and the citizens who came to show solidarity with them were not spared"
Never in this history I have seen farmers like this...
"Why media giving un- nassery coverage  to rakesh tikait,why don't u keep him aside,till election,"
How dare that policemen beat a farmer who is so old... How dare to beat the person who gives us food
Very shameful act by farmer
ALL THE HONEST AND SINCERE PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD SUPPORT THE LEGITIMATE MOVEMENT OF THE FARMERS.
"New Laws acche hai ya galat I don't know, but govt mai dono options dena chahiye. Ye farmers pe options rehna chahiye, jo farmers new law ko select karte hai, toh future mai agar government ke new laws se faide ho rahe hoange toh old laws ya mandi wale farmers apneapp new laws join kar leange. Lekin options de govt purana tarika ya new tarika, choose anything"
"Ok by putting up the Khalsa flag, u have made what was intended to be solely an economic issue of farmers into a communal and religious issue, which makes no sense at all!  U are just fueling that who khalistani bs which everyone knows will never happen. That too u did that on a secular monument!"
