"I fully agree, Here we have a chance to create a strong Hindu party as an alternate to BJP."
"2. Also, farmers get farm subsidies for electricity, water, fertilisers, and even seeds.   With the Mandi collapsing, the state Tax revenue is gone. This means no subsidies.  That will cause a havoc.  Btw, Agro subsidies are a big part of the west.  It has 2 effects -1. It skews markets beyond recognition in favor of lobbyists like corn etc.  2.  It is a must have since farmers cant survive without it.  The result is, it has NOT helped the farmer survive.  Its not the Free market. And, the effect on environment is beyond repair.  Indian subsidies on the other hand are way more effective since it helps out a v poor farmer and are free of lobby pressures at least when compared to the west.  We need to solve the Indian problem here not the western. "
"People are saying ""abhiman tut gaya, ghamand tut gaya"" . But it is the poor farmers who lost today."
It is the failure of the government - who made our farmers sit in the outskirts of Delhi in the freezing cold for two months-  making 3 bills to capture farmer's lands - is it not too much dictatorship on these annadadads ????
3. Farmer is at the mercy of these middlemen to purchase his produce. Basically exploitation of farmers happen.
Agar yeh desh muslim hota tho Rakesh  fuss ho gya hota
Why south farmers should suffer for duffer and broker of north india? No south state farmers protested and we have to suffer without reforms? Make seperate laws for south india and we dnt want foolish north indian politics!! We need farm laws which is long pending request...
"So arnoob are you saying that supreme leader modi lost to ""khalistani terrorists""?"
"After all this time, the three laws have to be repealed because of the contribution of the farmers.  Bjp fall began..."
I support only farmers
They are not farmers. They are goons of local political parties...
"I dont agree with the decision, but we have no other alternative. Modiji is only our hope!"
Waheguru ji bless all farmers  
Now modi supporters should regret
Yes: I agree that whole the world is watching this all in the shades of Chinese presence at borders. These farmers are providing bread  and butter to this country of 1.3 billion people. Have mercy on farmers who are out for the last 2 months from  their homes due to some sound reasons.
Why in India giving so much syphathy to farmers..agricultural same as business if they should understand what farm law how it's beneficial  to them...and farmer not selling any food to free...everyone paid for what they are eating...they are not farmers they congress Chelas....
"Actual headline for this video should be "" FARMERS ATTACKED FOR PROTESTING BY POLICE AND GOVT"""
4 wasted is on farmers
"Such a shame, Because of few farmers the whole farmer community in india have lost their respect. "
"No chance for Celebrations,  now Opposition parties have to get answers for their vehement opposition to farm laws, to silent majority farmers who were busy in their farms, couldn't manage to come on to roads in support of farm laws. This is a master stroke by Modi sir, still not understood by Rahul and likes of him."
Full Mark's to India today for trying to save BJP
"1) A farmer cannot go to the court when there is a conflict between a trader and a farmer. Don't you see it as a problem, given the extent of corruption in India, SDMs can be easily bought by bigger corps/government?"
"It is a matter of Investigation & grave concern that Congress party , AAP, Kisaan Neta- Unions & NDTV received how much money from China/ Pakistan to keep alive this so called Kisan Andolan against Indian State."
"Awesome straight forward explanation like jalebi and u literally said that now farmers should have to educate enough to right terms and conditions.. wow & now straight to the point, it doesn't look like that u r against the bill just make this video to convince people that bill is actually good for farmers... and it shows   in the starting of the video when u said that who already sets  their perspective about this farming bill don't have to watch video. My English is not too good but i tried that who ever read this can understand in easily ."
The threat of farmers are true.
"Abhijit Iyer Mitra was quite on the mark to point at an ignored area I.e. the underlying reality that today Punjab is heavily controlled by Khalistanis in Canada and UK, a threat the Indian Governments, both UPA and NDA underestimated, and that, it is the Khalistanis that fund the ISI and not the other way round. "
Real Farmers is at FARM right now
Isn't it funny to see Ex CM of Punjab Capt. Amrinder Ji raising the security concerns now? When he was CM what was he doing then? Wasn't  Security of the state  his duty? Why didn't he ensure that Punjab's borders with the enemy nation Pakistan was under proper surveillance with the help of Central agencies? All this dramabazi is to fool the people and score brownie points before the upcoming elections....
India should support freedom fight for independence of Quebec from Canada.
Let me tell how it turned violent police attacking farmer with weapons was ok but when nihanh singh protected farmers they were called atwaadi like guru Gobind Singh Ji was called baaghi
Salute to farmers
"The same fate happened to Australian farmers, deregulation of the dairy market in the 2000s with milk prices, the small size farms could not make ends meet against the big corporations who have dominance on pricing. From 88% in Victoria state in 1983 with deregulation in the 2000s to just 33 % now as dairy farms collapsed. Minimum Support Price also is not mentioned in the law bills, so it can turn too horrible for farmers."
- Cases against Farmers and activists should be withdrawn.
Thank a lot and salute to Mr Ajit anjum it's your victory aswell . victory of true jurnalism .kisan jindabaad . Proud to b a farmer.
THANK YOU TREVVER SIR YOU ARE DOING THE JOB WHAT INDIAN MEDIA SHOULD DO
these laws had the potential to release the farmers from the cluthes of the licensed middlemen and empower them various platforms provind them great value... Alas ..lost it all.
"Bhai  ,amazing videos,,I watch same one and other every single day .please make more videos on farmer protect..big respect and love to and cameraman parth...."
Thank you for supporting farmers  and Indian democracy
India Supports you Punjab Farmers. Farm laws to benifit Reliance & Ambani ??
Government back this bill. I support to farmers
"National Embarassment Shame On These So Called Farmers,Can't Even Respect Tiranga"
The best videos on farm bill is made by print. Thank you Shekar Gupta.
Govt wants to give the farmers land to their rich friends . ..Ambani nd so on ..
"One second you say MSP encourages Monoculture,  another second you say only 6% farmers get MSP and model should be extended. It should be extend so there can be more Monoculture.? You say government doesn't have space store grain, then you say government should have more mandis ? The need of the hour is transparent market acess, hand holding of farmers by corporates and scientific community."
These kind of violence is not acceptable. I believe real farmers will not do these things. They definitely respect Indian flag than other. Definitely these are not real farmers
I don't support farm laws
Problem is msp which government can't give legal assurance. Making msp legal can make indian farm products unsellable in global market due to their high price.
These are not Farmers these are goons
"Half of the country works in agriculture. I feel for these farmers who have likely been on single family small farms for generations, but the reality is that shouldnt be sustained in the 21st century when more efficient options for the country as a whole are available. If you look at the farmers decreasing share of wealth by GDP its mostly not because they are getting poorer its because all the other sectors are getting richer as they continue to industrialize/innovate. In the short term it may be hard to believe, but in the long term what the government is doing is probably for the best of all of them."
It seems the protesting farmers are clueless and don't have the authority to decide. The power to decide lies else where.
I can guarantee one thing ..no one of them  can tell all 3 bills that is proposed by the modi govt.
"Listening to DK Singh is anytime yes  . DKSingh says they did support farm laws in principle yes, but at the same time Shekar Gupta was propagating about how the poor farmers are going to suffer just by making assumptions and painting sinister color to it"
"I don't understand what was the point of stopping the farmers at New Delhi border & all this mess, if in the end they were allowed to enter the capital. "
In case of dispute btwn big corporates ans farmers over any issue farmer cant go to court directly and the issue will be solved by magistrate only who act according to even a local mla 
The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill
"Rakesh ji Dehli riots, UP riots, CAA, NRC, Minorities rights, Mob lynching ke ke baare me boliye phir chacha-bhatija kijiye. Hum aap ko support krenge."
