"The one who eat food, will definitely support farmer."
The whole farmer protest is a comedy
RG who's party has lost 2 elections under his leadership is the one getting blamed to encourage the farmers and protest  if he was this much capable then he wouldn't have lost.
"One i was only a Bjp supporter! Dimag sei socho toh We all are suffering,! Hindu muslim karke public ka kaat raha hai,mera bhaiyon Hindu Muslim karke koi fayda nhi hai! India Is a democratic country  country!"
"What a shameful people still exist after that brutal massacre in karnal, nobody want to get beaten unnecessarily if we r protesting something is wrong plz support farmers, even I m not a farmer but know all the problems faced by them. This incident will remain forever in the history and the upcoming generations will shock to know that nobody support farmer. Shame of u all who are saying farmers are criminals, if only Punjabis were not involved in the freedom struggle then all the people who are against farmers works as the servants in British ers home. Sorry if i hurts someone's feeling. #KISANANDOLAN #KISANMAJDOOREKTAZINDABAAD"
* @3:30 It highlighted Bihar as the least performing state as a result of lack of mandis but not Kerala and other states which rank higher in the same list and still have no APMC mandis.  
Great victory for farmers. Proves any anti people move could be defeated..no matter how strong the government pretends to be.
"This legitimisation and romanticizatin of divisive politics is an insult to Hindu, Muslim and Sikhs"
Good I suprort farmer
Salute to farmers no farmer no food
Thanks for courageously supporting farmers. 
This will only help big farmers. But loss for the small farmers. There are only handful of big farmers.
what a  liar!see his video on brut india...he supported the bill earlier..he is playing with people..
Congratulations to the farmers. Blessed is the Nation of India. Leadership is about understanding and flexibility. Congratulations to Prime Minister Modi.
Jai Jai BJP Jai Bharat Jai Hind Vandy Mataram Bharat MATHAKI Jai.  Go back  mandi valla.  You will support to new agricultural bill.
We say a big No to the Ambanisation of agriculture. We all stand in solidarity with our farmers.
This is British style plan that army and farmers which are savior of India  open to fight on ground
"GARBAGE FARMERS... Vietnam rejects Indian rice as not fit for humans ... Punjab rejects new Farm Laws. Yet Pubjab allows  Kisans from Bihar to sell rice massively in Punjab. Amazingly most of the protesting Farmer Unions are Panjus, perhaps they do not know what is happening in their own backyard or they do not understand the new laws ...  the average Indian farm size is only 2.28 hectares, they do not have tractors. Tikhait is a Congress ally and failed in elections. Seems these farmers are only out to BLACKMAIL the country."
"Looks like in states of punjab and haryana, there is great ""teamwork"" happening between traders, farmers and state governments.  So the Center should roll out the present AGRO REFORMS but allow the various State Legislative assemblies to give a thumbs up or thumbs down to it.  Punjab and Haryana and some parts of UP want to continue the current STATUS QUO and their State Legislatures will deliver that to them.  In ALL other States of India, the AGRO REFORMS have been very well received especially those who know what is there in these AGRO REFORMS."
"If these laws are so bad then why only Punjab farmers are protesting ,  does other states are not having farms..!"
Sir i can believe that kisaan from Punjab are influenced by foreign entities but is it possible for alll farmers from our motherland india and u know very well conditions of farmers in our motherland republic of india
"Our Farmers did not bother anyone in Delhi, they fed Delhi homeless. They showed once again that they are the one who grow the food to feed us. Thanks to Famers to feed the whole world."
USA small farmer got distorted. When private companies took over.
No words to say about your contribution in farmer's protest by writing beautiful lyrics and singing these songs...
Best ever video to explain farmers agitation
What a solidarity that these hands that feed billions have shown! Time for people to learn and stand against the repressive politicians around the world. A massive thank you to every farmer 
U r wrong aap and farmers where asking for farm law but the bill.imposed by bjp was black bill there was nothing like farmer will prosper
Farmers are most important people and major sectors(I would say all sectors) are depending on them and if they are in trouble then I would say government are not working properly and all politicians are begging votes before elections and then they are not working for farmers!
Punjab was lost in Congress time to terrorism and dissent nt. This protest is a continuation of dissent and national betrayal.
LoL even during the 1992 economic liberalisation there were protest by the people who love socialism it was just that indian industrial work force was pathetically small due to colonialism and  socialism. If these bills are taken back then it will be the continuation of the India's sick farming sector.
Is it not allowed for a farmer to progress in his life with his hard work? Even after progressing in his life if he/she remains in the farming sector he/she is a real hero....
"I do think the govt should look at the loop holes,the legal framework would end up favouring the corporates.the farmer cannot go to court for years"
I am a farmer from Assam and I say that your analysis and explanation is excellent. Keep up the good work.
"There are many mistakes in what you're saying. Farmer can only sell his produce in his local APMC. Selling outside APMC or selling to other APMC of the state is ILLEGAL according to old law. but some states like MH, KA have policies to allow sale of some goods outside APMC. Please read the act and then make videos. You are popular so please speak responsibly"
Farmers unity zindabad.all opposite party.leaders zindabad
Fall of Berlin wall 1989 was my favourite historical revolution but now my Farmers make me proud
"your work is commendable. so genuine video i have seen on the internet today. As far as i believe for every problem of the farmers , there is a solution given by the govt. lets see what will happen ?"
I think farmers are protest peacefully but there are some external interfance who only saying that they are farmers but actually they are not .btw who knows
"India in deep trouble, human rights are being violated *Farmers are unhappy*  pk"
Sorry to say but you have no knowledge about farmer bills. Have you ever visited a mandi . Have you ever been at an auction at a mandi.Its not about congress its about us farmers.
"Farmer sowed seed, God Jesus n bible is a seed of god's word satisfied ur soul by His death n ressurrection. C 'Bible' in google!!!......."
"This is indeed a shashtanga Namaskar by Modi that was totally uncalled for...this is just political expediency masquerading as 'National Interest' coming as it does now and not on January 26th when our Tricolor was abused at Redfort ...If Anti Nationals and anti-social elements are trying to hijack the farmer's protest, the solution is to tackle it head on with all the might of the nation...Is India so powerless that it cannot enforce what was passed in the parliament?...or is it the spinelessness of the Modi government that has always allowed issues to go out of hand (Shahin bagh ,NRC/CAA, Land Reforms) rather than nip it in the bud by addressing it with proper articulation and dissemination of its programs ...Modi is letting down  people who placed their trust and hope in voting the BJP with a huge mandate...He cannot now expect a repeat of it unless he shows some mettle in walking the talk."
With farmers ..
"People of Haryana and Punjab, ye bill sirf kisano ko kamzoor nahi karega balki in rajeyo ki arthvayevstha ko khokhla kardega. Agar kisan ke pas kharach karne ko paisa nahi hoga to shahar main vayapaar kaise hoga. Please I request everyone whether businessman, student, private employee to protest this bill as at the end of the day it will impact everyone."
Goverment decided that only low income farmer get benefit of MSP so poor farmer first get benefit of this.
Middle men providing loans to farmers sounds silly defence to deny a bill.
Government don't care about farmers at all. 
"Weak PM, the whole nation's farmers will suffer because of Punjab, Surrender Modi 2024 re-election lost."
Khalistan Zindabad . .the Flag of Khalistan was raised high over the red fort
Jab phati.tab yaad aaya. This is the power of farmers. 
Indian democracy  failed. Stand with farmers.
 2) BJP Goons (like deep sidhu and they are many in No.) Were allowed by police and Supported by police in reaching Red Fort and Defame the Farmers as well as Sikh community
Guptaji this session is a very cryptic view of the situation and BJP and it seems they have failed..but if you do not like them Farm laws is the wrong vehicle ..by praising the laws and at the same instant not supporting the govt in power one achieves nothing..if the implementation fails in the larger India..you are bang on!...Punjab and Haryana can wait for 18 months..not the rest of India!
Not only u explained farm bills u also taught about business stratergies..
" 1) Even though the corporates can have contracts with farmers but at the same time, farmers have the choice to either sell it to the company or to market as per their profitability. "
