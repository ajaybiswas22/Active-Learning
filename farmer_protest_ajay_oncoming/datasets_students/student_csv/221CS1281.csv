"1. THE FARMERS PRODUCE TRADE AND COMMERCE (PROMOTION AND FACILITATION) BILL, 2020"
"Well said Pakistan, and Victory for Taliban on your Independence Day for New Afghanistan."
Why was mainly Punjab and Sikhs were offended by the farm reforms ?
Sir you are the voice of millions of poor farmers. Thanks a lot.
Not only dacoit be send to mental hospital but also ABP TV anchor and the owners for showing such nonsense idiot n Taliban mentality man on TV
"1. If FCI is carrying grain worth 1.8 lakh crores and not able to sell, how is the farmer expected to sell this to corporates?"
Atleast Pakistan isnt abusing minorities as India is doing with Sikhs and Muslims
At this time Sriman ji government of yogi and Modi.
Please logo ko farmers bill padhna chahiye....reality pata chal jayega
India having 28 states and 7 ut now the que is why only 2 state farmers are doing protest not other 26 states and 6 uts. This law is applied to whole country . Now understand the chronology . Some countries funding for this protest . 
You always talk of both the sides but in this video it was one sided many famers have exploited their lands by doing aggressive agriculture they dont want to pay taxes and plus need minimum support price also they are not completely wrong but there is always a grey part its not always black or white
"Good to see the unity. Tight slap on GODI MEDIA FACES, BHAKTS and the Useless Bjp government. Shamed Internationaly."
"These are only few examples. Due to heavy losses, there are many farmer suicides in southern and central states.  "
Ravish Kumar the great man original PatrCar.Zindabad. you are right sar %
"Thanks for showing our farmers news , bcz our mainstream media totally ignoring farmers struggles"
That Farmer Aka khalisthani was Dead Bcz He clashed his tractor with Barricade
This channel did not show the main sentence which said that the only thing being discussed was farmer's laws. He was dismissing the khalistani or violence link. And that is good.
permission was just a drama they had planning for farmers but this time they cant stop farmers
"Here's a suggestion! Invite P Sainath for an interview and discuss the farm bills, you paint a very optimistic picture of it, he has some fairly credible opposition"
"Dear Sir,  Tikait Saab's detailed explanations in this interview is simply very fantastic, Sir. Hats off to you, Sir. Dear Sir,  the Ads appearing in your videos, also, simply very supportive and also superb,  Sir. Salaams. "
Study IQ terminate that last person who made video on farm bill
You can tell how well a country is doing buy how the farmers are doing
CONGRESS QUIT BHARAT THAT IS NOW INDIA. GANDHI FAMILY QUIT INDIA.
"Why govt is still holding with their lame policy, if farmers don't want it then throw it away"
India Today has become a spokesperson for BJP
"You cannot stop tha farmers ,,, I'm proud of my country's farmers"
I am Indian from West UP and there is injustice being done to the farmers which is wrong. I strongly condemn this and the government should change it and accept the farmers' words.  Modi government is doing good for big businessmen but by implementing this law they will cut off the stomach of poor farmers and laborers.
Farmers are fighting for country
Please just add one thing in your Bill that is MSP for the sake of farmers . Why you dont do this?
Very beautiful and nice humanity in farmers. Kisan ekta jindabad.
"The government's surrender to a small group of corrupt middlemen has set the template that would now be used for every progressive reforms that India needed and I personally felt very sad, the way our  Prime Minister Narendra Modi apologised even for such revolutionary  reforms in the field of farming and heartfelt condolences for such real farmers who are really in need for such laws.."
Who needs a spokesperson when you have media channel like India today supporting them. 
India and Russia will support to panjshir i hope hope this is going to happen
farmers go home make india great again
I support Taliban .Now go for pakistan and win there also .
"Just because i hate bjpee doesn't mean i love Congress. I have never ever given a single vote to the Congress. In 2014 i voted for nota, in 2019 i voted for bjpee. In 2924 is we have the same candidate, i am closing for nota again."
Thanks for your social media support regarding Indian Farmer's...need more from everyone
They ignored the initial smoke coming from punjab and paid the price.
Why are the farmers of punjab and haryana in particular protesting ????
Really great Job Rakesh ji.. God Bless you all Farmer's
"These farmers need to move on to a more sustainable business model. Right now they are living on charity through indirect subsidies like MSP and free electricity, Are the indian farmers not capable of living without charity?"
There are four demands of farmers for which this protest is happening
Nothing Will Works For Farmers ( Specially Small Farmers)
"Farmer laws were all good ,,I think government should not taken them back they made a mistake"
Not seVERAL STATES JUST PUNJAB AND HARYANA
Actually this decision of repeal will impose only negative consequences on the actual poor farmers in the long run.
It's not Farmer's protest It's protest for every nt so rich Indian citizens for there future.
"Salute to the Farmer Warriors & thanks to the supporters. Peace for those who lost their lives in this cause. Next big MOVEMENT should be against Corruption, Communalism, and Scoundrel politicians. Lets work together to establish a Progressive Democratic society."
Government acting as dumbard...must listen and repeal laws against farming 
Then these law can be implemented by state government. That will help the state eventually and that state could become a role model of prosperous farmers
"Manuvadi BJP cowards have attaked the farmers from behind, at farmers back, now manuvadi Padmaja debate."
Truth is that unless and until the Hindus enter the streets... their voice will not be heard in India.. Whether its BJP or congress or something else. Ram Mandir is there just because few brave Hindus decided to enter the streets and dismantle the structure built over Ram Lalla
Dada ji makes me cry    how can Someone called  them terrorist .     Even some of my relatives called them   terrorist.   Rip those barave farmers  
Most shameful day for our country. These can't be called as farmers but rather terrorists.
 Instead of subsidies it's better to give good price for farm products.
