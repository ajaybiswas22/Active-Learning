"I think these laws are very important for the country.  Middlemen must go. They are reaping the benefits of MSP, not the smal  and marginal farmers."
this is only for Punjab and up elections
Who is giving these so called poor farmers money for protesting since last 10 months
"This is Karnal motherfuckers we will remember this, Haryana will remember this, BJP won't return to Haryana for at least 2 more decades"
Thank you for being voice of Farmers 
Keep on protesting majority voters in India are in support of these 3 bills so does not matter how much they protest nothing is gonna happen and if the supporters of this bill come out on road we will outnumber them by 1 to 20
Great leader is p.m. modi ji
Supportingourfarmers
Good reply of Rakesh Tiket ji. Kisan unity Zindabad
Very Good.  Great  Rakesh Tikait Ji
Only police have the rights to use violence and batons against Farmers. Its a free country and so are farmers. They can use sticks too.
I support  farmers & stand with protest and against government policies
"Get out of your comfort zone and face the reality, these farmers are fighting a bigger war not just for themselves but for everyone of us. Lets support them now so we don't regret later on."
Farmer are doing right 
The farm laws were  good for the small farmers and hurt the middleman and corruption.
"If the all Farmers should sell their products to Private corporaters... They are completely collapsed PDS.. then there is no mean of Rashan Cards,Antodaya Ann Yojana, BPL cards."
"Just to correct you with the fact ,farmers doesn't pay the tax in APMC mandi ,its to be paid by the buyer  ."
Although u told about farmer side of the protest it's incomplete ......the people protesting are actually not farmers but middleman who take a lot of commissions which results in higher price than the farmer sells there goods.
"So, if only 5% of farmers use APMC in the first place - why are farmers protesting the fact that markets outside of APMC will stop getting taxed?"
"This opposition is totally shit...earlier they want that this Law should be remove and now when the Parliament repeal the bill they need discussion... on such bills...this shows their mind set ....opposition doesn't want peace always opposing, and shouting....in the house..."
Farmers land belong to corporate. Jamakhori is legal now.
"Both farmers and consumers, both are looser."
India has indirect 100 crore farmers but we need <10 lack farmers 
Omg that's ALOT of people to feed!! Always got to have Big Business stick their noses in!!!! Hope the Farmers Prevail!
"I am sorry, after watching your video, I feel that u stress too much on negativity of farmers n very quick statement (unnoticed) on negativity of central government / Delhi Police. FARAK  PADTA HAI"
7:20 i'd just like to say there is no provision that anyone can take their land contract farming is not about taking anyones land they clearly dont know what there talking about so basically they are being misguided. I do however agree about the farm laws decresing income of the farmers so something should be done about that.
Very good at least someone who is doing good for the farmers. Jai Bharat Modiji is the best PM.
Thanku ndtv for covering this news  other channels are playing dirty politics and hiding the facts standing against farmers .. really appreciate that you guys are doing your honest part  .. where these days all the mainstream media channels have sold themselves to modi government and misleading the facts spreading fake news or ignoring the reality  .. im sure all the farmers and true indians will always appreciate your channel and support you .. 
where have you been when tamilnadu farmers protested... !!!
You don't know Modi ji now in coming days such will be circumstances that farmer will come to Modi ji and ask for form bill 
Kya godi media bhul gya regarding such type of interviews.. What a healthy talks with Rakesh Tikait ji.. Wow..
"After repealing farm bill , many youtubers, tool kiters, opposition, so called farmers going to face severe shortage of foreign funding."
"5. Deregulation of food items? There is no deregulation of any commodity, because there was no regulation of any commodity. Regulation existed only on markets in order that markets facilitate proper weighment, proper price formation process. However despite the APMC regulation, even to this day, farmers are given bili chiti, white slips which are totally not transparent. Even after 55 years of APMC act, farmers are still receiving a very low price share out of the consumer rupee, because of market inefficiencies and market imperfections and several practices such as undercover sales, illegal deductions by merchants, exploitation of farmers in interlocked markets, cartels among merchants  depressing the prices and so on"
I always support farmers 
We know about other nations situation as well. So these laws will definitely not work in favour of farmers. See what adani did in Himachal.
     All Indian farmers
The bill is to benifit the farmers.
"Much needed but way delayed judgement by SC. In democracy you have right to protest but you can't block public places indefinitely. Many common people, business related transport even movement of ambulance is became tough. India loss billions per year for road and rail blocks. These people must talk with govt to resolve the issue. But it seems like some people don't want to end this agitation for their personal and political interest. Only some people don't represent farmers of the whole country. New farm law is for all farmers country wide and we must not underestimate silent majority."
"We support Modiji, we support BJP only who can take India to a new HORIZON"
We love our farmers 
"Don't call off the protest, until the brokers-dalals are thrown out and poor farmers get their  fair share."
If the market rate is 10 but the rate fixed in contract is 20 then farmers can sell their produce at 20 and the company has to buy it. If the company denies to buy the farmers can file a case against them On the basis of contract as their proof
For farmers their produce is the only source they can survive. .and the farmers should be left alone to do their work. .Why does the GOVT succumbing to the BIG PVT PLAYERS TO TRESPASS and create problems for farmers? The govt can make provisions against for big farmers exploiting small farmers. But bringing outside GIANT players will eat up both small and big farmers MORE SO because the Govt and Govt bodies will DANCE TO THE TUNES of the GIANT PVT PLAYERS. & the farmer community will disappear or stop existing.
Govt trying to real farmers but It's not fair to the middle men as they loose their commission & their livelihood. Paid Hooligans create ruckus disrupting anything & everything.
"Govt of India give 3 lakh crore subsidy to agriculture sector annually which includes from fertilizer to MSP, however mostly consumed by big farmers from Punjab, haryana and west UP, we have disguised unemployment in agriculture, our productivity yield is low, APMC is monopolized... Only privatisation can save this..... It contains huge potential, informal jobs will convert into formal, farmers will get their deserving share."
Thank you to my brothers and sisters who participated in this awareness rally in New Delhi. Your support means a lot. Keep spreading the awareness and continue to awaken our brothers and sisters who are still asleep. The government is determined to suppressing the voice of the people and Citizens of India are determined to have their voice heard.   Insaniat Zindabad! 
1) MSP (minimum support price) is guaranteed so there is nothing that farmers will get less that the minimum price
It was happened with farmer is very crucial way now in india it is seen like that humanity isn't present here 
Support the farmers 
In up election bjp surely win. Then bjp creat this i cant belive. This creation need some peopile they creat this
Modi BJP will sale all root and institution on one men BJP sponsorship.
Powerful farmers
The law should cover head load goons in Kerala for bleeding the farmers
We stand with respected farmers 
"Why did you not highlight the fact  mentioned by NC Saxena at 7:46 ?  He clearly mentioned that not just the government is buying wheat at almost twice the price from the farmers its has not increased the price of selling to the poor. Please don't mislead nave people. Be unbiased in your analysis. There is no difference between you and that chaudhary guy from Znews, just that you are on the opposite sides. Bharat mata ki jai."
Taliban is nothing infront of Indian army
