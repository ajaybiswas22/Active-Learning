Farmers should feel ashamed after doing this kind of act,0
"One thing everyone needs to understand is Central Govt proposes and implements laws at the national level. They'll see what is more beneficial at the national level. When less than 5% across the nation are participating in these protests, it thumpingly displays that the new farm laws benefit the nation better. If it may cause any loss to that 5%, they've to sit with Govt and talk about alternative solutions for their possible loss, not fight to repeal the new laws. I hope this brings some sense to the protestors.",0

"When he used the words ""Breaking the chains of slavery"" he was referring to the withdrawal of foreign military troops from Afghanistan.

That would be the only way to end this years-long conflict.",2

" I am also the son of a farmer, so this pain is our own, if the farmer is not happy then it will be difficult to feed the whole world, first he committed many suicides, some debts were buried, he appealed to the state government  Oppose the decisions and understand the pain of their farmers and speak for their rights.  The media should also emphasize this.  Most of the farmers make a living by cultivating on a small plot of land, do not deprive them of their rights and oppose the decision of the government and so I request everyone that this uf",1

We can already see the effect of these laws on ground now that Adani is buying apples in Himachal at the price of rs15 per kg and selling it in rs200 per kg in super stores across the country.,0

You can keep protesting. Similar attitude here - if government was discussing points in systematic manner ( like you laid out ).. Delhi ane ke jaroraat he nahin padte",1

Farmers have already filed case in Supreme Court challenging legality of these laws.  A good multi pronged action.  They should also ask their BJP MPs and MLAs whether they stand with farmers or against.  They should boycott all of those who are favouring the farm laws and denigrating the farmers movement.  They should protest in front of BJP offices in each of the districts asking the party to take a stand against the bills,1

Farmers - MSP can't by guaranteed. Guaranteeing MSP means the money goes from taxpayers or Corporates pockets without any quality evaluation. A MSP range per year can be proposed based on estimated demand by Govt. (Govt.and Corporate can use data analytics and set MSP range based on historical and projected demands and make the process transparent and visible) but Kisan cannot go to court when MSP is not within the range. And no guarantee. Nobody knows accurate regional demand in advance.,0

To say that it is being restored to its original intent of being minimum support price and not, what it has become, maximum sale price will not do. Do throw some light on that.",2

If a farmer has produced 90 quintal rice/ wheat whatever..,
Farmers should invest in big data analytics to predict the changing weather patterns and availability of water and other resources.,
They dont like round up.,
Have you noticed any flaws in the reform laws in interest of farmers. There are many new opportunities in laws for farmers without diminishing the previous facilities. The compulsion of brokers are eliminating from agricultural products marketing. Which will free genuine farmers from the cut money of brokers. Many other provisions are in favour of farmers. If we genuinely wants to help farmers we should support agricultural reform bills in interest of farmers not brokers and other interest groups.,

In the tribalism that is breeding with the help of those who would divide you, when there comes a time to take control, the tribes must give up their divergent resolutions and find a cause for all their strength. They will respect a desire that's able to set in motion every heart. What desire can unify the divided. Find it, and make it your rallying cry. No farmers, no food. No me, no you.",

Stop focusing on totally irrelevant ideological matters that has NOTHING to do with the reasons this faction rising to power is a problem and danger to the surrounding nations..

They were just going to Delhi & regardless of being beaten they fed meals to those policemen.  Here, are 2 links, kindly see what is the reality behind all this.
