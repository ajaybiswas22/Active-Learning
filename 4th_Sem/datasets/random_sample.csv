Was it verified if the actual profession of each protestor was farming only by the Delhi police
Reforms are necessary in agrarian sector but it should be beneficial to the farmers.
Very good explanation.

"So in such cases, BJP should immediately arrange to bring a NEW INHERITANCE LAW where such children are debarred permanently from inheriting parental and ancestral property if they don't take care of their old parents. In case of ABSENCE of any WILL, which might happen due to sudden unforeseeable deaths of parents, property inheritance laws should be changed so that these thankless children cannot inherit their parents property at all in absence of a Will. These children, in absence of any Will, should be compelled by law to prove in courts by default that they have taken care of their parents AFTER they got married."
I think it's Wikipedia
Boht ache farmer bhaiyo
I can't believe here is democracy if government is for peoples and people's are not happy with new farm laws then why govt is not repealing them ??

"Development means more jobs, high salaries, low utility costs, low taxes, affordable health care, high quality education and large number of growth opportunities. Justice based governance means nobody can misuse power. Self-respect and inner strength means always standing with the right no matter who is against you. It doesn't matter you die rich or poor but make sure you die with self-respect. For that to happen ask government about development and knock it down if justice isn't served. Farmers are doing the right thing and Modi is one of the biggest scam."

I cant understand are right or the others are right. I understand the concern but they are doing too much. They should not kill people
I have the feelings that Amrinder Singh has misled Modi ji in believing there is big Khalisthani and ISI infiltration in Punjab corrupting Punjabi youths. There might be some truth in but this has made Modi ji to take this drastic step to repeal three Farms Bill's opening the doors for others to create troubles. The security of the nation is the most important. Looking at hindsight Modi ji should have acted immediately after the criminals disrespected the 26 January hurting many of our policemen. Modi ji softer approach on gadhars Khalisthani/Leftists backed farmers leaders has made them feel that they can get away with murders. Modi ji should have stopped the funds coming into these goons/criminals Khalisthani farmers.
"This is not any victory, but big loos to future of India."
Modiji will not dare ram the Sikhs on the wrong side .

"Dear Sir:  Agreed that Punjab and Haryana farmers are doing well and they want the current STATUS QUO to continue.  But there are other farmers in the rest of INDIA who want to scale up and do something.  For example, KERALA FARMERS are all ready to scale up on JACK FRUIT POWDER and are making arrangements for cold storage system which will be made available through FPO (farmer producer organizations).   Like this there are many many examples.  If Punjab and Haryana are happy with STATUS QUO then so be it."
Wow such a hate being spread by bjp leaders
Modi has a great great speaking skill.
Where is Gus subsidy
Hopefully rally goes peacefully. Happy republic day.
I wasted my time
For farmers their produce is the only source they can survive. .and the farmers should be left alone to do their work. .Why does the GOVT succumbing to the BIG PVT PLAYERS TO TRESPASS and create problems for farmers? The govt can make provisions against for big farmers exploiting small farmers. But bringing outside GIANT players will eat up both small and big farmers MORE SO because the Govt and Govt bodies will DANCE TO THE TUNES of the GIANT PVT PLAYERS. & the farmer community will disappear or stop existing.
"Now who will save farmers from the clutches of rich farm middlemen, arhtiyas, Dakaits? The farmers will continue to born in debt, live in debt and die with debt? Government should not have repealed the new farm bills. Very unfortunate."

India needs to take care of its farmers. They are dying because of psychopathy of the Modhi regime. Also India needs to respect women and girls because child rape is rife. Another problem is the caste system. India needs to abolish the caste system as it's discriminatory to the Dalit populations. Another problem India has is the open defecation cultural habit which causes virus like the Delta variant.

"4.After the contract if prices are up then farmers still have to sell for least price and it leads to huge crruption and is useful for brokers , mediators and whoever have power"

"Only punjab farmers are only lion, sacrifice, mard & bold. Whole Indian farmers accept Punjab's farmers are darpook hai. Bharosa karana kisi par foolishness hai. Pure desh ko farmers milenga but sacrifices only sikhs for  whole humanity. All good human Indians salute sikhs to think about others. Asali made hai sikhs because sikhs always sacrifices  for whole human beings. Sikhs are  God of the God's creation. Sikhs saved whole human beings. Every good human, honest, hard workers Indians salute sikhs."
"Before elections,         Master plan......not stroke dear.....UP elections are very near     "
"What is the purpose of this rally? what are they trying to prove?  I just dont understand the intent. Gov has agreed to stall the laws given assurance of MSP. Farmers still want to suffer at the hands of middlemen and sell only at APMC's and pay commission agents, they want to grow only rice and wheat and expect gov to buy it at MSP. Something is just not right !!! Anybody in their right sense can understand these laws are going to benefit the farmers across india. Unfortunately political parties who have lost all credibility spreading misinformation and using gullible farmers for their own agenda. Hope common sense will prevail."
Americans your yime is running out...so sad...

"Farmers are being used by thier so called leaders as sacrifice. Real farmers have already exposed tiket and the likes of their political ambintions. Why is no news channel reporting on that? Why was khalistan flag hoisted on red fort? Who is supporting such separatists? Questions need to be asked why were police officers attaked and barricades broken by so called ""farmers"" "

Finally Feku & his sanghis brought down to their knees. Next steps : 
"The clauses of the contract farming act seem to be written in a way to attract private players to the farming sector. That may be fair from the government's perspective. They too need to be encouraged into participation. But farmers have their own apprehensions. So: to allay the fears of the farmers, the farm laws can be tried in a few pilot states? If the experiment succeeds then the model can be replicated to the rest of India. "

Finally India today trying to shed godi media tag
Opposition hardly get opportunity to say something.
Why this slow version video instead actual version? The Actual version is worse attack on innocent farmers.
The Centre has set a bad precedent by giving in to the pressure of farmers; Hereafter the other sections of the society will follow in the footsteps of the farmers to get their demands fulfilled.

Spam and misleading
"Firstly i am against this MSP system itself, this socialist scheme  looks nice to hear but we need to understand when and why it was bought, it was before green revolution when we were importing wheat. After green revolution things has changed this MSP   has forced farmers to grow only rice, sugarcane, wheat because state decides the price. Godowns are full of wheat and govt is unable to sell the goods"

"Anyone with common sense can see that the current system needs change. The current system is propping up the Punjab argri sector and giving them over inflated returns which is obviously not fair to the rest of the farmers in India. I can empathise with Punjabi farmers as they are used to this preferential treatment, but deep down even they must know this can't go ahead for much longer as it's ultimately not promoting equality!"

Farmers should sell their grains to the public directly either physically or even online....only if they get their rate which should be twice the MSP.. All problem will be solved
that's what happns when Government tries to turn democracy into dictatorship
Pakistan and Afghanistan have much difference with each other.
People are responsible for that. They choose always wrong people. People have given super power to the politicians.

Yeah but they don't have any pilots to fly these weapons especially the helicopters i can't believe the afgan army didn't bother to fight you have thousands of people who are trying to leave and don't want to live under taliban rule yet they don't have the will to fight the afgan president should be arrested for abandoning his people

We are with you Dear farmers 
Its shame political has lunatic like papu
One day these farmers will say to government to put back farmers law again later
"Taliban Kissan, destroyng peace of nation"
Farmers are innocent hard workers.... Hope government tries to educate them about the empowerment and benefits of the bill passed. Its only because of state government politics and misguidance which has lead to chaos. Not at all farmer's fault. Nor the central government's fault. If farmers are worried then government has to convince them and make sure corporate companies treat farmers equally as a business partner and do not exploit them. Once mandi system is removed only then farmers will be able to think out of the box. Hope we see farmers evolve and be the richest and happiest citizens.
It is a clear sign that BJP is losing ground in UP . Fear of losing UP election compelled Modi to cancel anti- farmers law. Jai  Hind

Dear citizens please wake up against this Facist regime. Other wise many things like this will continue to happen.
Great way of teaching mam..
"Most of the agricultural land is given on lease / theka . but Patwaris are bribed to state in the Revenue records - Girdawaris names of Absentee non tiller landlords including NRI land owners la as Khud Kasht i.e. Actual Tillers . Actual landless tillers are not mentioned in the Revenue records . They remain faceless , nameless and helpless."
Sir I respect u
People were not getting the full story here in the USA!
Very clearly explained. An impartial  account  of the effect of the farmer's  bills.
"These r not real farmers though , these r Khalistanis instigated and funded by opposition to defame the current government coz of upcoming state elections ......"
The people of Afghanistan will never accept being ruled by this terrorist group.  In time everyone will see how determined the Afghan people are. Taliban will be sorry.
That's how aspirants deceive interview panel. Good case study to introspect for UPSC..
"RSS run BJP govt want to divide people on religious lines. Their atrocities on Muslims, Christians and now against Sikhs. Inspite of the rights guaranteed in the constitution."
Me and my other friends are doing study in overseas and stuck here because of Covid otherwise we would have joined them too. #FarmersProtest . We are well aware of these laws and know how they gonna impact or lands please do support if you are a good human being thank you
"Who can trust America? Is the US able to handle China, Pakistan, Russia, North Korea, Iran etc even if it fails against Taliban?"
Modi want to make vote bank stronger for U.P election.
Mind blowing. Dont underestimate power of farmers .

Why is NON Indian  media soooo.. much bothered about Indian protests ???????
Bhaut natak ho raha hai ye opposition backed farmers unions se
Take care that no one misleads you: For many will come claiming my name  (Matthew 24: 4)  
"In a democracy, one's educated opinion is equal to another's illiterate opinion as both votes have equal weightage of 1."
"But our 56 inch PM very much busy with his cabinet seat, Rafel deals, Israel spyware on indian public and govt  machinery, selling  of indian govt properties to his friends, no time to look into Afghanistan where India did lot of investments. "
"I am from lakhimpur kheri ,this incident looks planned and a method to somehow effect stability as the elections are very near ."
Why no western president blames the Indian government regarding Indian farmer protest????
Gyani lok...that who managed these funds for 365 days against these protest for thousands of people on delhi- UP  borders.
"There is a difference between doing the right things which strengthens a country, and doing the popular thing. This would be another reason why China was able to grow at over 10%/year when it was at India's current level of development, whereas India can only grow at 7% (often even less). Without deepening market reforms, India is going nowhere. Unfortunately, sensible policies are also often unpopular. Say you try to build a road, and you have endless opposition for years before any work even starts, you have already lost."
"Hathras,kathua,Lakimpur kheri, Pegasus, Godi media (most important wen media control by some fringes then the democracy is died already)"
Omg kisan leaders to smart what thay doing now
Mr Modi & Shah both are criminal & murderer of 750 farmers for which both will be punished by our judiciary within short period of time.

"How wrong it was! At one side India shouting we are democratic ones & on the other side this!! It's totally injustice going on with democracy. I totally agree, it was wrong happened. There is totally lack of free & fair elections then how could one say that nation is still maintaining it's democracy?"
Good explanation
Yogi Will win he have done a lot for us here in Azamgarh
There is only one people powerful against BJP is farmers.
Ruthlessness is the key. Ruthlessness.
The Anandpur Da Matta is in writing and the Government of India would benefit from making it law and then wait for UN to arrive for the whole map of India and it's radical to change next year. There will be no Congress elections in Punjab as EVM will be own up to shreds permanently

"Give a phone no to connct,iam ready to throw my job and  join these people"
Strict action needs to be taken against these so called farmers! Enough is enough!
Hindu muslim dose is too heavy on the minds of people
Dalal  would tell the rates to farmers and farmers will have to sell as per Dalal rate
All the kissn of Indiaust have to priduce wheat and rice  etc for their according to their need and should not produce  oil seeds and vegetsbles for their dsily needs and rest if the field s  should not be cultivated  fir two years.Then see the  Govt  policy to provide  for the people of india how Govt provide food grain and  vegitables and oil  . So this kinds of actuvity must be implemented only fir two years then the Govt will surrender ti the Kissn and will take back three Black  Farm Acts.The Govt .must be of any political part

This is the power of people. This is not gujrat. This is whole india. 
It is good for the country as otherwise  the Nation might have to lose the great leader Mr.Modi as PM due to possible BJP defeat in the North.
Why dont he gave DEMO by taking one DANDA on his own Head.  This is make them very very clearr
Good luck   bahut acha

They can't understand that laws are good for them..
"Ur video is just like""Small packet big bang""it really make my all concepts related to this farm bill clear nd also make me able to ponder about the reasons why farmers are protesting. "
And few with khalistani mindset wish to break Punjab from India using this opportunity.
Just just end monoculture of one type of crops. It's doing global warming and climate change
So ... without awareness. And proper education...the sucess of new laws would be suspicious....
Specially sikh farmers... 
They should not trust this government
Happy Republic day.. 
Plz world help us Punjab and hariyana bjp worst gorvment ever history in India...plzzzz help

Dalal media= terrorist in india
Let the national interest prevail.
Farmers are becoming perfect patsy.
Modi sitting in his castle dividing and ruling sikhs fight the mighty tyrants history will repeat itself when power of democracy will be the peoples

They are hoisting Khalistan flag in place of our dear National flag. Such a shame to support them. Shame on NDTV.

Rip 
Reforms are good economics. But turned out to be bad politics.
Arrogance at its peak
Sooo....the farmers don't want capitalism? They want governments to regulate the markets and do not want a free market.
"2. post dialogue with farmers and govt ,On december 9th clarified with 10 point "
BJP prepared for Hindu Muslim agenda but Sikhs came out of syllabus.
"They only raised nishan sahb , farmer flag along with Indian flag"
BJP wasted 7 years. BJP lost 7 years. Those who voted for BJP in 2014 and 2019 will not vote for BJP now. Many people are disappointed with BJP.

AGRICULTURE KNOWLEDGE NOT UPDATED BY YOU AND PEOPLE OF INDIA HAVE NOT AGREE WITH YOU AND YOUR CONSIDERATION CONSULTATION NOT DONE  
Good presentation. Gvt must work with farm leaders to working on new laws ...input with all will help with new farm law. This is not a loss for modi...or win for farmers. Common sense won over.
Put facts over your agenda.
"It has been seen that whenever someone comes to destroy Islam, he himself perishes.  Look today Taliban which is nothing, which had no good gun weapon technology anything and now America which considered itself as a very big super power.  Look at his condition today, it is not worth showing his face to the whole world. And listen to the whole world with open ears.  Whenever anyone comes to destroy Islam, he himself will be destroyed.  Of course, Allah will make the habit of Islam to what extent, which is also mentioned in the Qur'an. Allah has said in the Qur'an that no one is a better fighter than Allah. Subhanallah Allah Huwakbar "
What if farmer is unable to transport its good to factories directly.
Khyber and balochistan is part of Pashtoonistan   Afghanistan  Hungry weak Punjabs die
"The state government should stop the tax from farmers, it is good that the farmers can  trade their goods anywhere, I think the middle man traders need to be stop, while the farmers are working so hard to make every penny and the middle man are taking 10% to 20% of their hard working money of farmers earning, we need to look forward to build a digital farming policy, it would be hard for now but it will give a great opportunity in the future"
How did this men won a noble. Even a laymen could explain better
Sir you need to elaborate more.. most of states doesn't follow mandi concept
10. You talk about positive news but fact is(quoted by niyu) you just want to show things which are aligned with your ideologies and government
This law will bring educated and skilled professionals into farming. And this will lead to innovation and productivity. If I can sell my produce directly to someone that's called freedom.
We Kerala farmers support

"It's so funny during CAA protest, delhi riots, everyone blamed one person Tahir Hussain, and now this police officer doesn't want to take one person's name. It's a sad sad day in our country.

And people wonder why farmers commit suicide. They are burdened by heavy loans and the banks cannot touch people like Mallya but will go after our poor farmers. Harass them irrespective of what their situation is. Hopefully the government comes off it's high horse and stops treating them like our enemies. We eat  thanks to our farmers. Hope and pray that this is sorted soon.
We support Farmers. Farmers feed us food. Farmers now protest for every Indian and Indian's future. Protect our Farmers from Sanghis.

I would appeal to folks like Devendar Sharma to make changes to the Farm bill and put forth a proposal. This would change the discussion from Pro/Against Farm bill to the meat of the matter.
With left and mslm lobby getting stronger due to wokism etc in west Modi is a liability for hindu causes. In the back of his mind he is on the defensive because of gujarat riots history. Particularly because he cares too much about international image.
Sikhs have again showed their true intentions.

Violent terrorist farmers hacked to death 4 innocent BJP workers. They are creating issues by blocking the roads as if the country belongs to their fathers. Forget it. Enough of giving largesse to these ungrateful farmers especially from Punjab.
Sikh people are going wrong now
Farmers are fighting for Country
Cunning move taken by BJP with the upcoming UP elections  in mind. Dangerous party for all the working class people. We should teach them a lesson in the elections like southern states TN and Kerala
