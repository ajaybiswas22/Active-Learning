" As far as protesting farmers of state of Punjab and Haryana are concerned, there only demand should have been the exemption of  their states in the Act and nothing else as it would be unreasonable to ask for grants from the government despite the latter is giving out huge sums of subsidies without being asked for."
nothing in written

Govt should have control on both APMc and private too.not only for these all issential things other wise only people will suffer from this . We already have real example of private educational institutions.
"YOU MUST ASK EVERY FARMER FIGHTING AGAINST THESE REFORMS THAT NOW ONWARDS HOW WOULD ANY GOVT DARE TO REFORM ANY SECTOR ESPECIALLY THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR? This agitation was just a reputation tussle, not any logical base."

"The flag hoisted at Red Fort isn't a Khalistani Flag, it is called Nishan Sahib and the National Flag was not removed from anywhere, Nishan Sahib was placed on an empty pole near Red fort entrance. At some UP Election Rally BJP lotus was placed above the National Flag. I dont know why every media house have covered what happened at ITO, defaming farmers for hoisting Nishan Sahib but these people have been out there, barely surviving this harsh weather conditions for over two month patiently and peacefully protesting now, many died no one really cared, tricked by DL Police and remain unheard by our country's media houses, politicians. A ground report from the channel @scoopwhoopunscripted is seen covering the eye witnesses statement where they admit to have seen DL Police damaging DTC Buses and blaming these on farmers (10AM-11AM).

Who is here after farm laws are repealed?
"DJ sir, I have been a fan for your unbaised analysis however in recent, intentionally or unintentionally you are making comments that looks biased and anti-BJP, whether we like it or not current BJP weigh many things before making decision that's what makes them famous and able to rule in a very diversified country like ours."

I'm sure there will be some reason for this move.  Just because we don't know that does not mean it is a stupid move.  Let's wait and watch.
Congratulations to all the farmers!!!
Always win! Why should government fight for farmers when they wont fight for themselves? And In turn lose elections and then the whole country loses!
Thanks for the beautiful video. Make more videos from the protest

Are the genuine poor farmers even capable of such largescale dharna? Isnt it pure politics of the middlemen who would now have no role and obviously no margins...
"We are SO TIRED of this shit show. It's not the farmers actually, it's the brokers (dalals) running this lame show now. Most farmers amd overseas interests don't even understand what's going on, and naive farmers are being forced to participate by these brokers with ulterior motives. Fun fact: 'Khali' also means 'Empty' in some Indian languages. Go figure."

"........  the fundamental issue of the protesting farmers is that, almost 99% of Indian farmers do not have adequate/requisite resources, education, internet /computer tech knowhow of paper/document works, and logistics etc to enjoy the privilege of selling their products across states, and even international markets ( selling their products overseas through shipments), ...  this is the basic Q that would need to be weighed in and  answered now by the Govt  ?? .....

"Guys please know that the Indian government did this exact same thing in 1984. Sikhs were fighting the corrupt government then too, they were fighting for INDIA. They were NOT asking for Khalistan. But the government maligned their movement like they tried to do with this one, calling them terrorists and Khalistanis and turned Hindus against Sikhs. And since there was no social media at that time, the public was successfully fooled by the government (Congress at the time). BJP is the same as Congress. Remember that in the next elections people. Vote for someone different than these two if you really want to see change. If you really want to see a true democratic India with a government that is FOR its people, and not looting its people in broad daylight. Please realize this before its too late, before India is bought by goons."
This is disgusting theyre attacking defenceless people
option A
Bring back farmers law
"what is this shit of zee news, only showing video after incident and claiming farmers are bitting thoughs guys in jeep but in real first jeep act on the farmers who are walking on the road in which four farmers died at the spot and many of them injured. then farmers become offensive and then they started to act on the jeep. THIS IS THE REAL INCIDENT HAPPENED. jeep is of union minister's son. zee news should show real incident. I AM BJP SUPPORTER BUT  now I am upset with bjp."
"In India law and order is on side of the majority. It is infested with bribery, fake encounters, political affiliation with ruling parties, discriminate against minorities, with low trust with the public. Minorities, Sikhs at this point, have a low trust value in police providing them any justice. There have been multiple cases, where Indian police has attacked Tortured & Sikhs. Recently in 2020, a video shows in MP how brutally the Indian police is beating the Sikh who is a granthi, on account of not having a license. Police officer only got a temporary suspension. "
"Tell me only one thing! Just one!  What and why in the world, Punjabi ""farmers"" were doing and protesting on Cowbelt UP soil?!"

"Looks like in states of punjab and haryana, there is great ""teamwork"" happening between traders, farmers and state governments.  So the Center should roll out the present AGRO REFORMS but allow the various State Legislative assemblies to give a thumbs up or thumbs down to it.  Punjab and Haryana and some parts of UP want to continue the current STATUS QUO and their State Legislatures will deliver that to them.  In ALL other States of India, the AGRO REFORMS have been very well received especially those who know what is there in these AGRO REFORMS."
"This process of MSP is making farming distorted to nation's needs. Why Punjab Haryana continue to produce wheat, rice when neither it is good for punjab in long run nor it is needed for country. Governments are procuring from Punjab as otherwise they will lose election. Hence large pressure group in terms of vote is resulting in distorted farming practices"
finally repealed
It's not political party's lost...you bloody polititians...it's the loss for poor farmers...k...you...

Just compare what happened to BSNL after coming of privatization. BSNL vanished. Prices are not controlled.
A answer
APMC monitor every transaction as every consignment enters APMC is tracked by APMC till it get sold. And APMC ensures the product sale is not below MSP. And there are warehouses where farmers can store the produce if the price are not convincing. Warehouse charge small amount to store the stock and maintaing the quality as it is. Banks gives loans to farmers on pledge of the stock and that to at agri loan interest rate.

This tikket and his jahil team will never stop the agitation... Their sponsorers don't want to stop... The richest farmers of India is doing this protest... If these jahil tikket do not leave our court must intervene
In my view the govt should have included some of farmer's committee heads while formulating/passing farm laws. This would have avoided the protest. Repeal of law is not a good sign for the development.

Congratulations Sellers (so called farmers) to brainwash and dilute the minds of farmers. Who gave you the right to block the national highways causing problems for normal middlemen.?

"Very sad to our old farmers from Punjab and other states dying on the Delhi roads. 600 farmers lost their life. These farmers fed India from generations. What is their fault? Only fault is in 1947, Instead of taking their own country they proffered to stay with India as Nehru promised them freedom. People now you can see kind of treatment India gave them."

But he has now taken his supporters for granted."

Only the large richie rich farmers wud benefit from this bill  marginal, medium farmers and tenant farmers will not. Better mention all the aspects !"

Government destroying farmers life. Lots of farmers already die during protest but government didn't consider anything about this except talking.

Sadly farmers are fooled into believing that they should oppose this laws while in reality these are the same laws which will benefit them in long run.
"Excuse me you need first confirm that is there any meeting or not? After that when modi did not listen them in punjab when they block Punjab, they listen their demands. So, now they know, if they block delhi. Modi has to take step. We also know modi will not listen us only in one day, he took some days thats why they are only delhi with some month food. So, they will return with their success. Govt welcome very nice of farmers with tear gas and pressure water then they need to broke the barrier. Listen modi is not good and he dont knowledge what right and bill."

"Me reddy you asked a question - ""why should we not trust government"" - it is very naive question. It is either asked due to foolishness or extreme bias. But anyways here is the answer - history. Looks at recent protest in last few years - and you will realize that government has nowhere shown genuine interest to discuss the issue. Attitude is more like we have majority so we passed the bill. You can keep protesting. Similar attitude here - if government was discussing points in systematic manner ( like you laid out ).. Delhi ane ke jaroraat he nahin padte"
OWAISI is paid by BJP to scold during election time to divert all people to vote for fakus fake patriotists party
Here Government want to make a law for Farmer which was rejected by the farmer.
I stand with farmers rights. No farmer no food.
He is right. Modi has to put nations religion culture and freedom from foreign gandis more than him self and give platform for many Hindu organization to take roots for the betterment of our country with its religion culture people

"Stupid to say in one word decently. A reform recommended by various committees, demanded at various times by these very same farm associations & finding mention in political parties' manifestos suddenly becomes contentious? If ""farmers"" are worried about their mandis & 'middlemen' fading out, what prevents them from contributing the taxes saved to them? It's quite strange that 'humble service providers' suddenly become ""life saviors"" & ""family lenders""!! Where do they get all the monies when they are worried about their livelihood being lost due to these reform laws?? Nothing of your blabber makes any sense. What is very visible is your mad rage to oppose whatever the Govt does. Considering this reform has potential to increase contribution of farming sector to GDP by two fold, and, that we have no other arsenal in our efforts to boost economy this significantly, any opposition to this reform must be construed as criminal & those who are fantasizing that this Govt can be brought down by developing a perception of general disenchantment, would even sell the country if it can fulfill their dreams.  While you have no compulsion to become a good citizen, just reflect on yourself as to why are you doing this great harm to a poor country whose poor people are desperately looking for meeting their basic needs & live a dignified life? It should hurt your conscience if you have one."
"The underlying problem that presenter highlighted in most of the drawbacks is - ""apprehension that govt. would abandon and cease to exist as a player, hence leading to exploitation by private entities"". But the government has assured that it would not cease to exist as a player and included strong provisions to protect the farmer in various situations. Further, if market forces resort to such behavior, govt has tools and capabilities to further enact the laws to protect farmers interests. But based on this apprehension alone, is it fair to disallow the private players who could reduce inefficiencies in the system and portrayed successful co-operative movements like Amul and others? Plus we have examples where govt. continues to exist as a player alongwith private entities - airlines, power, oil, telecom, banks etc."
"After so many explanations and good will by the government, even to the extent of witholding the laws for the next 18 to 24 months, it is sad to see some in india hell bent on disgracing the government. There is no respect by the farmer for the nation. Just a group of debauchers."
Finally Feku & his sanghis brought down to their knees. Next steps :

"Very upset with this show, I liked this show a lot but I can see that saurabh is conflicting his own statement over farm Bill, I watch all video  , in old video he explained why he will support farm Bill now he is against all the point, what happened sir how much fund you got to change your statement, very pathetic and disappointed "" ab ye show news nahi propaganda chala raha hai"" beware of him guys."

"one side govt said that it is ready to amend laws and on other hand it said we promote this law by doing pc and chaupals. i think govt is itself confused, they want to promote that laws which required amendments, how shameful govt has no concrete stand on its own law."
Pappu and his jokers party
These laws r  like this.
"This is not a farmer agitation it is Arthiyas agitation... Arthiyas are the agent who are used of squeezing poor farmers, but modi now doesn't allow this anymore..."
"Bill no. 1 - says any one can store any amount of ration.. for example someone having huge warehouse can store anything for example they stored onions and can potray that there no onion in market . Thus after that selling it at higher price later. For example , around 2-3 years, potates were almost sold for 1-2 ruppee for kg, now guess how much u bought it for?"
And today the laws have been Revoked!!.

Punjab and Haryana have very good market system for farmers thats why farmers have better income compare to rest of the country.  Indian farmers allowed to sell their produce anywhere in India from many years. Owner of 5 acres in Bihar works as labourer in Punjab. Why ??  Cuz open market system exploits the poor farmers in Bihar and other parts of the country.    Second  law allows unlimited stocking privilege to big corporations  so they can control the price  so farmers also fighting for middle and poor class of the society. Contract farming is already failed in Punjab.
Unke vesh me it's just pro khalistani movement to break India. And u wish that too ?? Itna bas bolo bhai
     UP          
I would appeal to folks like Devendar Sharma to make changes to the Farm bill and put forth a proposal. This would change the discussion from Pro/Against Farm bill to the meat of the matter.
Oh? That protest is still going on? I thought they pack up and left when India was hit by Covid 2nd wave.
Loved this video
To arrest someone without any warrant.This is BJP Modi Government..it really sucks
"If farmers can sell directly and farmers are given freedom, then that means the people who are protesting are the middleman or the agents.. then all this protests is for this agents or middleman in the name of farmers, as it's easy to gain sympathy over farmers name"
"People of Haryana and Punjab, ye bill sirf kisano ko kamzoor nahi karega balki in rajeyo ki arthvayevstha ko khokhla kardega. Agar kisan ke pas kharach karne ko paisa nahi hoga to shahar main vayapaar kaise hoga. Please I request everyone whether businessman, student, private employee to protest this bill as at the end of the day it will impact everyone."
So Mr Gupta agrees that hoarding should be legalised ? Is it so ? Or was that a purely generic statement.
"Frmers are  not enemies , they are who feed India . It is unfortunate for the BJP they voted to power."
India the union is on a dangerous and self destruct path under BJP RSS rule.
Thankyou paaji for showing this. God bless you
