"People of Haryana and Punjab, ye bill sirf kisano ko kamzoor nahi karega balki in rajeyo ki arthvayevstha ko khokhla kardega. Agar kisan ke pas kharach karne ko paisa nahi hoga to shahar main vayapaar kaise hoga. Please I request everyone whether businessman, student, private employee to protest this bill as at the end of the day it will impact everyone."
Which one is the largest?  They all look a bit malnourished to me.
Wait ...filter ho rahe hai... actual kisan...and...bank account wale Kisan... government know bank account for foreign funding 
- Do not procure everything that is produced. Let center procure what is needed. Home states find ways to manage the rest. I do not like the tax money is being spend for purchasing grains at a higher price and then excess grains is being wasted.
Excellent reporting with good analysis
2. Govt will decide price of pesticides
I appreciate your efforts..thank you for supporting farmers 
Your explanation was good in theory but you clearly can't understand the problems that farmers would face...
Rakish no farmers
You guy's  always  have the middle  ground  where. Everything make so much  sense truly  love your work  guy's  Respect+
Wake up modi government or the day citizens decide no government can remain how capable the leader is.....
Media Houses need to learn from you!
Modi ji......You have done good work for kishan.
India really  need journalist like you people 
"People are saying that these were for the betterment of farmers. I just have one question if they have studied a little bit of Polity, What was the need of passing these 3 laws through ordinance if there was no malafide intentions?"
Kisano jago till law not cancelled in parlment don't trust.
Well this how hypocritical the opposition benches are in Indian politics
India should be prepared for anything 
Abhi an Niyu .The videos you share are really informative and unbiased . Thanks for explaining in layman's  language so that everyone can understand
India close embassy in Kabul fear of Taliban blowing . Super power are going back after 20 year's war . Good step by India early early return home no guarantee of Taliban strong enough
Our prime minister cannot bow down. He does not have any modesty or courage. He brought the three laws without consulting the farmers and took them out without consulting them. Whats the point? Well the point is it has been done keeping the punjab elections in mind. He wanted to make Amrinder Singh look strong. Modi does nothing for the good for the nation. Everything he does is political.
"I would request everyone to check @sikhexpo page on Instagram. They have the ground reports and tell the whole truth. The media twisted the narrative as always. Trust me, as always."

"Politics aside, I appreciate her attempts at pronouncing the Indian words and names."
"1st law:  If all the farmers will sell their crops directly to the companies then APMC will be ended soon and also the Food Corp. of India will also be closed or terminated. After that, most of these companies will refused to take crops at MSP and because a farmer already spend money on the cultivation, he will not have other option to sell his crops at low price."
"These farm laws would have industrialise farming in india, but alas. India should have accepted RCEP, these farmers would've been obliterated by industrialized Australian and argentine farmers in the indian market."
Bcz you are sold out media
"In other hand many people are favor of these farm laws and see this law as reform in Indian Agriculture sector. The argument that the India farm sector & economy was not doing good from long time and demand lot of public govt money as subsidy, loan waiver, MSP ( minimum Support price ). Also stats shows only 7% total farm produce is buy under MSP. No Govt in world provide such public govt spending in farm sector. Private sector involvement, competition is necessary for reform and advancement of Indian agriculture sector. Also Corporate have done good for India in IT, Dairy milk sector ( ex- Amul ), Engery etc. "
"Very good discussion.  PM. Is country,'s P.M.and not of any party . So even in election time he should be  a neutral figure and not campaign for even the party that he belongs too . It will set a very fair and a good precedence ."
           India also rushed out its nationals after much bravado from the MEA.
"Maam I have a little doubt about that art.122 which u explained that some immunities given to Parliament that SC CAN'T interfered on kts proceeding but u also told about three condition I.e Untouchability, illegality and irregularity so finally Is farmers or any citizens can make complain go against over Parliament in SC for it's wrong bill???"
I am also from India. The farmers are protesting to protect their right
"All in all, this has now become proof of concept that the Will of the Indian State can be opposed (& ultimately broken), by a well-coordinated & sustained campaign (aided by support from foreign enemies - in terms of media, money & management), until it inevitably acquires a ""grassroots"" characteristic. "

"""We are proud vegetarians and yet ran over farmers who grew our vegetables."""
"A Big Corp will only buy form a Big farmer that is simple economics. The small farmer will continue to sell to APMC markets and still continue to get squeezed by these middlemen. Once the big farmers using tradingbplatofrms can begin to sell directly globally this will in turn increase there profit margins and may in turn increase collaborations between the small farmer and the big farmer. Big farmer will then say don't sell to Mandi but sell to us which inturn will.force mandi to give a better price and less exploitation by intermediaries. The act simply empowers more alternatives to market, larger areas of geographic distribution and removal of state barriers. The only losers are certain state govt like Punjab and Haryanan losing their high receipts to agriculture and the middleman who held a monopoly for so long. What is further needed is education to small farmers of their rights many who do not even know about MSP and are at the mercy of the Mandis."

Imagine if same is done in India... still you will support it?
Modi is doing bad they are sitting from last 29 days peacefully and still asking for the same demolished these black laws. They didn't want that and they never ever ask for it.

Farmers protesting for past 6 MONTHS 
"You have done good research but not sure why you left out the cases against India in WTO for giving MSP to our farmers. Countries like Canada and USA take us to court for these MSP, interestingly many politicians from these countries were first to support these fake farmer protests. MSP is not as easy as it sounds."

"3. personal relationship with middlemen : so the poor farmers all over india should not be given an option to sell their crops to private companies directly, because middlemen of punjab can give personal loans to punjab farmers. and farmer all over india are dying due to their poverty. but there should be a protest to save a personal relationship between punjab farmers and middlemen.

Problem is that.... Liberandus doesn't seem to listen...They Just Blindly blame BJP for everything. They need to accept the fact that Marching to Red Fort was just senseless
They are very well educated.. It is visible from how they explain their views.. I really hope they get justice. MODI is a disaster
Support from Bangladesh..
That woman would have don't publicity stunts over there and incited a riot
i always support farmers
Good veer ji bhut si confusion over
They will be vanish for good 
The only con which I can see is - Farmers generally rotate the crops to keep the soil fertile. but if the price for a certain crop is lucrative then farmers may repeatedly go for the same crop which can damage the soil in long run.
These laws were not fully explained to farmers before implementing....may be if they had not let it be weapon for opposition then all should have been good ...still I'm not fully sure these laws benefited farmers on ground...they were awesome on paper but not on real life....because middle man didnt go anywhere except they now had something to fight for....greed and power were motives in this whole play in the end comman man lost
That's what happens when some don't want to make farmers bill pass for their political agenda  and playing politics they don't want to development of India 
"Protest is very very important in democracy , and this is our biggest power to save democracy"
3) Was he going to set up an industry based on food and food production?
"They won't even leave farmers, until they bring farming sector to ground like gdp, automobile, politics"
"Your wording ""few lives lost"" is humiliating to the farmers.Around 900 farmers lost their lives and for you it is ""few lives"". What sort of reporting is this?"
This is complete lawlessness and chaos
"Thank you for the information Shekhar ji, you are providing amazing information where none of the media in india is capable of producing."
goverment are right to grow country gdp but its rupe for farmer but farmer dont need..... r.i.p.. english
More than 70% of people are against these Laws.. Media is owned by government that's why reality is not shown to world . people say that only 10% farmers of India are protesting.. These 10% produce more than 60% of india wheat and rice..
Sir please do a CTC on Land Acquisition Bill...we have also forgotten about the bill just like the all mighty party...
So in this way we all tax payers can also sit on strike to minimalise our tax and at the end government would reduce our taxes VAT etc. I think this was not the solution to the problem.

Why don't govt allows crop to be sold on free market

"Every citizen of this country should be grateful to our farmers.Farmers specially from Punjab, Hariyana,U P, Uttarakhand,& other parts of this country not only produce food but also produced good soldiers.My sincere salute to all our farmers who faced all troubles unitedly&won the battle."
"Sir in APMC and mandi there is bidding process and price discovery mechanism. If the discovered price is low, farmers can sell at MSP. How will price is discovered in direct trade with a company. Will companies purchase at above MSP because they always try to maximize their profits by reducing the costs, so they always try to purchase at lower rates."
What  do you expect  from  bjp ?
Good work by police to end this endless drama for farmer protest
No  one disrespect  indian  flag   show any one video  in which  indian  flag  is removed
Msp should be implemented soon
Imagine seeing a new farmer group(the real farmers) now protesting to reintroduce these 3 farm laws
This only gives confidence to so called farmers and motivates them to continue protests regarding other issues.
Good on you bro! You are the only food vlogger to cover this after harry uppal rest are just scared or dont have enough courage to post anything about any anti government bill
Do something to help them revert the laws
Proud of being farmer proud of being sardar
You will see the minister son will be free who killed farmers under his car and later fired on them.

But I feel some relief, at how these brave men and women  have been standing tall and strong against these arrogants while they have opportunity. Long live revolution. Long live truth."
Security and freedom and women working to outside are a right please UN do not forget women and children of Afghanistan 
But actually the fear of change in traditional subsidized farming is veiled behind this attack on the govt reforms.
Bringing reforms is really hard in india.
14:28 Now this will be recorded and shown that dhruv belongs to a particular party
No comments in this regard people of India has already given their comments for sponsered Govt everybody says all thease rules in favour of Corporate who sponsered this Govt if farmers says thease rule not in their favour why not withdrawal the same now every man is say primnister chor hai

Bring back sharia in pakistan and see people fleeing from the state 
"what many people dont understand: 1. central govt doesn't have budgetary resources to buy entire product of all farmers around India, that is why they don't want to make it a law otherwise they will be bound to buy everything. economically and fiscally, this is impossible. 2. APMC mandis are strongly cartelised meaning only few people can buy from there becoz getting license is very difficult and costs a lot (>5lacs) so these traders buy produce at low prices eventually hurting farmers. also small farmers don't have money to take their produce by tractor to mandi, pay taxes and storage cost till produce is sold. by legitimising outside mandi sale, this will help them legally sell outside mandi. farm laws have been in implementation in m'rashtra for over a decade and now and mandis are still intact. 3. conflict resolution problem is genuine (this is something that govt should consider) 4. repeal of essential commodities act will benefit traders who will now want to buy produce to sell at higher price without govt intervention. even if we imagine that this will lead to steep prices, will it not lead to many people beginning to trade to sell at ""slightly lower price than competition to be at a profit""? this will ultimately ensure correct prices (this basically is the essence of market economics , i.e, to promote efficiency through competition and self interest."

The fight is nationalists and honest against anti nationalists and corrupts. Majority of Indians are in first category. They are watching the anti nationals and corrupt and seething in anger and will take appropriate action.
"India is at civil war, there are increasing number of pockets in India where Indian identity (Hindu unity) is rejected with hatred. Farm laws were supported by many farmers,but rejected in these pockets.We have Kashmir, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamilnadu, few of North eastern states, if my guess is right ruling party of Andhra is also Hindu haters party (look at their party flag). Hindus have elected Modi knowing fully about all these. But Modi and BJP is utter disaster for Hindus. These problems need intelligence to solve and I think BJP looks helpless and incompetent."
This conditions responsibilities totally goes on center government who doesn't solve farmar march since two month. Obviously formar bill not totally bad but some point shude be change Or correct by government

3. More than 60% population living in rural areas directly or indirectly depending on Agriculture and allied activities which contributes 15-18% to our GDP. 
"Very less quantity is procured by govt. each year. Concept of MSP is not wrong, MSP price is minimum price should be paid. The price should not fall below this certain limit. Private middlemen should also fallow this, this is expection. "
And a few hours later his ministers said they can consider bringing in the laws at a later date. Shows two faced nature of Modi BJP.

"These bills are being opposed by all the farmers organisation, multiple farm economic experts not just Congress or political parties. "
I don't understand what's the problem means the rule says that if farmer wants he can sell his produce without any broker . U know farmers get just 2 rs for tomato's which we get at 40 so eliminating the broker is an amazing step so why are these men resenting it and the truth is that all of these men are dalals or brokers or the little number of farmers in there are either brainwashed or are the once who are relatives of mps or higher commission officio who take all advantage of government schemes
"As per the Agriculture Census of 2015-2016, 86% of farmers are small and marginal (less than 2 hectares). How much bargaining power will they have in a free market? How will they go and find a market for their produce? Also how will they decide what is the correct price and that they are not being cheated? Are these small and marginal farmers going to receive any training? The concern the farmers have is how will they be connected to the free market. Although they have the option of APMC. But wouldn't the big corporates use their powers to ultimately make the APMCs unsustainable in the long run? That would make MSP redundant. All these are valid concerns that should be taken into account. How can a law be passed without consulting the stakeholders/beneficiaries for whom it is being made? The RSS affiliates like Swadeshi Jagran Manch and Bharatiya Kisan Sangh are also opposing it. Are they also being manipulated by the opposition parties? Shekhar Gupta ji, you have not analyzed the issue properly. Sorry, did not expect this from a senior journalist like yourself."

"I think Central Govt should announce that a Committee headed by Mr. Satya Pal Malik will look after the issues related to agri , MSP implementation and all farmer related issues and will submit its report within 6 months. The SKM leader will immediately call the agitation."
Why are the farmers of punjab and haryana in particular protesting ????
bro .. election are coming in UP jab bengal mai election the to suddenly petrol price 12 rs se gir gaye  LPG ke prices kam ho gaye kaise ? election khatam hone ke bad phir prices badha diye gaye . election jivi . modi jiwah  wah modi ji
He actually said something opposite what farmer leaders are saying
The protest have more than one dimension . The principal reason is the fear that the new lagislation would lead to abolution of msp. There have been verbal assurance that the msp will countinue but the govt is unwilling to make it statutory provision .as it is just an administrative fiat. But now i feel very comfertable to see farmer unit and i have proud to all my brother sister who are move forward without flinched in this tumultuous time. Now modis govt. has totly lost its credibilty . All community are get together and by this unity farmers definitly get their rights . We all people should rise to against modi otherwise they gonna to make all peoples life miserable . The dectetership will going to end very soon.
Yess there is nothing about withdrawing the MSP but there is mutual agreement between the farmers and corporates about the price...nd we know who will win the bargain...to this there is no need to read the Act upside down its title including words agreement on price assurance indicate enough..
"Great Episode Mr Shekhar, if farmers watch this, it would definitely open there eyes blinded by dirty politicians like one. Mr AKJ..."
Please tell me the full form of MSP
You missed the Red Fort parts.
I really salute you sir. Future P. M of India.
Good protest 
It was really the best line.
Ye uper wale ki sena he bjp neta chup rahe he.
The farmers are very much justified in their protests.
"Just FYI, the crux of the laws were first brought in by the UPA govt which were opposed by the BJP(then in the opposition)! And the consequences of the laws: Will reduce the dependence on middlemen and make the producers or famers richer2.will incentivise agri diversification meaning growing lesser water guzzling crops  3. will reduce stubble burning considerrably meaning the Capital region will be relieved of the notorious toxic smog that engulfs the capital in the winter months and suffocates the population..."
Actually it seems one state Punjab and few illitarate fierce Punjabis are ruling India now 
Every government is like a mother to their population. But in case of Muslims and BJP the relationship  is of between  step mother and step son.
This plan is goods . 
But only educated and very very very rich farmers. 
I think this time we all need to change our thinking instead of changing the government or laws or leaders or anything

Excellent leader Rakesh ji we are with you Sir
Speed up Modis speech
"All subsidies are ""bad economics"", but it makes sense to subsidize essential commodities, like food. Not to mention most farmers can't simply find another job  if they are unable to produce profitable crops on a free market. MSP also protects farmers from being exploited by private corporations, who would LOVE to redefine the meaning of ""minimum"" prices."
We are witnessing another freedom struggle to win over the ignorant and the dirty politicians who have vested interest at the cost of the national development 
" Judiciary- This was the pillar that was supposed to be the strongest. But then again, we saw many cases like Prashant Bhusan's and the denial of RTI on the so-called PM CARES Fund."

Really it predicament for indian.
Please invite Mr biden for new govt ceremony he is a very good cathelic
- MSP law is not good. Goverment should provide MSP this only when they can do. Not legally binding 
" I am also the son of a farmer, so this pain is our own, if the farmer is not happy then it will be difficult to feed the whole world, first he committed many suicides, some debts were buried, he appealed to the state government  Oppose the decisions and understand the pain of their farmers and speak for their rights.  The media should also emphasize this.  Most of the farmers make a living by cultivating on a small plot of land, do not deprive them of their rights and oppose the decision of the government and so I request everyone that this uf"

"Excellent analysis. I worked on a similar subject for another country in EU. When I integrate the new Indian laws in my model, I can say with confidence that the farmers gain 11% more within 5 years. The problems are: Indian farmers do not trust the government; the laws are poorly drafted.; not sufficiently discussed in parliament; farmers, the real stakeholders were not involved in the drafting. But, the way in which the union government handle the protests is poor and inhuman."
Great example of true media
"Content is different from heading, great sekhar ji"

Survival argument by the farmers which won the day.  Hurray to suffering farmers.
They are the backbone of our nation's economy. The government should listen properly to their side as well. The condition is so pathetic.
"People should make ""Amar Kisan Smarak"" at India Gate as a tribute to thousand farmers died to save their farms from modern Ghori."

I was looking for an impartial comprehensive analysis on this huge and controversial issue. You solved my problem sir. I know it took a lot of efforts  into research. Hats off for this awesome content !!!
Great work sir ! My opinion is not to exploit farmers and yes MSP should be a legal right
Great efforts from a great man!

Next graveyard is digging by us for Indians
Sri Lanka has this same problem of farmers not being able to sell their cultivation at a decent price. The authority should know better to give the necessary facilities and make arrangements for the farmers to sell their products directly to the customers without having to go through a middle party. Agriculture should be given more attention. Farmers should be treated fair.
"Farm reform are necessary , my extended family is majority farmers and i understand the farmers problem but then something like a farmer tribunal or any other organisations is necessary to explain contract to farmers and regulate prices and mediate the contracts so companies don't make self profiting contracts. "
The answer will say how  it harmful to farmers. 
Now Modi ji took a step back by this but I hope you know when Modi took one step back then what will next.?? 
"Bro, if Govt. wants to get out of Agri businesses, then what's the guarantee that the farmers will get protected from or out of these  bills..!!"

Your movement has been hijacked by khalistanis and anti social elements. First understand that. Dont blindly support anyone. There are always different people in a protest with different intentions

"Let's be clear on this farmers protest, it is only a small percentage of farmers that protested and large numbers are the middlemen. Ask yourself this question? If this law was evil why didn't the whole farming community of the country protest, that would have made more sense? In retrospect, this is a politically motivated protest same as the CAA and NRI Bill. The people are no fools, they are well aware of it."

What about And what's the difference the proposal of Dr Manmohan Singh then finance minister in 1991 and the present farmers bill.That time BJP opposed the proposal and that proposal became silent .It should also be studied and discussed .

Happy Independence Day .Don't forget our India's heroes .
"It just shows that India is not China and we cant just strong arm stuff , even if they are the right thing to do. I hope this is a lesson for the government to engage in broader consultations before pushing laws through. It also shows the inherent strength of democracy in India and the strength of popular public movements. Today I feel very proud of my country, even if I supported the proposed laws. Kudos to the farmers and their resolve that brought the government to this decision. Thanks to the PM for showing this flexibility, even if it is for the elections. Lets heal and move on"

Aaj bhi anaj store kar sakte hai but limit me. I think if informing the stored anaj is compalsary to government. Then it will not benifit corrupt people's as well farmers also inform government about there production.
Now the Government will face opposition at every bills or any other issue every time
So what suddenly changed? Who are creating confusion and apprehensions among farmers? Who are the forces behind this movement?
"I hope the govt will come back with the Farm laws after consulting the concerned and rightly educating the public. We need to modernize in order compete with the world. Tax cannot always flow in one direction alone viz. into subsidizing the farmers always, since there has to be an end in sight to these subsidies, else it is eating into the taxpayer paying public."
Thank you so much ScoopWhoop. I was so wrong about this protest.
Bro Im fuckin damn sure . Hell make lots of money in this election
Excellent job done by u... Show more to the world so can everyone support... Government is doing wrong tell everyone I request

"Good Law . Bad Deployment ! Sad. Shows slamming laws down someones throat doesnt make it real. Consensus building through democratic means involving all relevant stake holders while can be slow and painful is the right strategy for India. People clamoring for muscling up strategy on any issue over consensus building approach should know India is too fragmented and diverse in its view points to be strong armed into one. This would have been the best time for Bjp to use its cadre to do drives related to benefits of these laws rather than employing rhetoric. Nevertheless the last part of what PM said gives me hope. All party committe while could set us back by sometime, should atleast get us some part of these laws back if not all. To the nay sayers of these laws , i want to say one thing. Market economics is the only reason why this country has developed in the last 30 years. To move against that would mean agriculture would continue to slip as a percentage of gdp.  We dont want to be a food importing nation again. Lets be 'together'and do what it takes to revive this sector."
Government kneel down Infront of farmer because of election har saal ESA  election Hona chahie tabhi desh mein acche din aaenge 
Congratulations all of ye sabse badi jit hai...
"Those laws were beneficial for overall improvement of agriculture sector. Moreover,it will also encourage protests against CAA and article 370. "
India can never change.. bad decision by govt..
The whole world watching tomorrow because tomorrow is a big day in India. 
Kisan do not disrespect of tri  flag they only fly with kisan and Tri flag khalsa flag .infact they fly three flag both of. It's show public r not mad .one thing remember our gov. Beat so many kisan and they do protest from 2 months peacefuly. It's only sign of this is democracy not dictatorship of gov. Kisan r right. Only our gov. Do misguided to people.
I too dontt support these farm laws but there should also be a solution for avoiding  farmers repeatedly harvesting wheat and paddy due to msp and leading to ground water depletion. Also subsidies if possible should be channelled to small land owning farmers rather than being a generalised one.
Great salute to Farmers.. Who showed the way.. How to fight this nautanki govt..
"One thing you forgot to mentioned,  according to the first law, in case of dispute in the contact, farmers can't go any if the Courts for a resolution. They can only bring the issue till DC. Imagine farmers taking a case against Reliance or Birla to DC for resolution. Who will win? Exploitation could be at mass level."
Fall of Modi. Going to London for treatment and a shave.

APMC ... can be used as benchmark for setting MSP as a minimum procurement price for the commodities?
What is he supposed to do with the farmers protest?
Most of the media houses are silent .
Ravish sir is way above any journalist in India. The way he presents the stories is just amazing.
Decisiveness judge from this improbable peculiar circumstances
Delhi protest - Lathicharge and golibar.
*So This Is Peace As Per Taliban *
No farmer no food...if we fought for others right than why we step back to our own right....
MSP has led to complacency and has led to zero innovation over many decades.
Thanx fr the explanation..
Can't we just make next talk between farmers and government public let's get it on television live so everyone can understand what's going on transparency is must. Let's see whether these top leaders are actually discussing something or not.or they just want chaos
We hope to see Farmer's happiness after prolonged protests. We wish them to enjoy no hidden conspiracy.
This will only help big farmers. But loss for the small farmers. There are only handful of big farmers.
Please turn farmers towards crops diversification
"6:58 ""peacefull protest"" yeah we saw that very well"

Yes tikaet sahab your decision is absolutely correct
"Do u guys have any fear of God or any humanity left ??  Remember, God, in whose name you are encouraging hate against common man knows the truth and your souls will have a lot to answer !"
PM Modi would cowed down to anything.He repealed farm laws.A frightened PM fearing break up of the Union from 3 cornersHe may even put back article 370 to restore Kashmiri autonom.
i like you Rahul Gandhi congress party

Again glad to watch your Amazing video karan we support farmers thank u for this effort for our Indian farmers Bharat you are awsome keep doing it!!
If U Don't Consider The Problem Solution (Law) Do Seem To Be A problem. I Even Started To Doubt My Belief And Understanding About These Bill After Watching Your Video. I Do Hope Your Video Help The Farmer Protest Because It Sure Doesn't Help The Farmers.
1) How will all transactions currently happening in APMC give MSP to the farmer?
Today I am highly disappointed. This is why we are not as developed as other developed nations.

They are stunned and do not know how to react. They suspect a Modi trick on the offing.
India needs Farmers (Food) NOT Politicians (Liars)
"In the present situation, middle men are eating most of the money of farmers since dey buy agriculture goods for very low price and sell it fa higher. But according to new bill. He can sell it directly to corporates fa higher prices, but the thing is MSP should be continued. Even in the covid condition agriculture GDP is +4.6 where as other sectors are in negatives Giving better pricing for the farmers produce would bring miracles in agriculture.There are pros n cons... Whatever but farmers have to b benifitted."
God bless the farmers. Let not the people starve before the government change its ways. God give them a better plan which benefits all the people.
We are witnessing the death of Law  and democracy in Lowda ka sarkar

Why put so much money? And who could have such deep pockets?
Why is NDTV giving out opinions instead of going unbiased journalism?
Give them khalistan as well
"They are god for us, We should always respect and support farmers."
They have also disrespected *BHART MATA* .
Condemning 26 violence (farmer police included) shame godi media!!
Farmers suicide is high among farmers those produces  crops that are not covered by MSP. This facts is good enough to understand why India failed its farmers in South India. Bill essentially said that now onwards state will have sole responsibility to protect their farmers with a parallel system of procurement of crops when market price falls down. States such as West Bengal is doing it for quite some time and by passing FCI procurement systems to supply food to other states such a Tamil Nadu or Kerala. Food deficient states will have to have forward trade agreement with food surplus states in order to establish a new equilibrium in crops supply. In other words central government has minimised its responsibility for procurement and redistribution of food in India.
10. Eight MP's were suspended from Parliament that day. This left the house empty. 15 bills were passed through parliament in the absence of these suspended MP's because the opposition was eliminated.
God bless all our farmers
Salute to farmers unity
The new 'farming laws' are infact well designed and purely based on 'Free Market' economics. 
Banda to sahi hai .....Modi jindabaad . we have lost information war. that's it. The same wrong information spreaded at the time of CAA.
These laws will kill them.
Where Is National Human Rights Commission???... Farmers must go To the Court & Seek Justice 
Thanks for explaining sir and very nicely said
Can we conduct elections every year? That makes politicians do good every year.
This guy should be in jail long time ago. Why media is still highlight him. He's very rich with crores still Kishan?
4. The whole thing about the personal relationship of the middlemen and farmers strikes me as a cultural thing in Punjab and Haryana. Maybe these state governments can continue to support APMCs.
Thank you lallantop news channel for showing farmers side

We hats off to the farmers
This open market policy is not new it is already there in many states even in my state of Tamilnadu it's already there that's y my AIADMK government is not opposing the bill. In many other states it's already there now it's becoming act that's all. In Punjab farmers currently farmers  can only sell to Mandis no open market policy  there that's y they are protesring that means middle men are higher and state government is heavily dependent on Mandi charges. This shows that more than the farmers Middle men are more affected.That doesnt mean there were no issues for farmers yes there but like water shortage and some other issues. I support the government wholeheartedly in this.
I am preparing for third wave
But don't use them and brainwash them For your propaganda...
World   Leader   Modi   
"Haryana , Punjab especially are going to be heavily impacted , but instead of slowly assuring farmers about the laws and properly consulting about it , listening to what they want , the way they hurried and passed this bill and labeled ""Every protestor"" as a ""Terrorist"". You can see where this is leading up to."
No head no tail
"food so yum yummy, l wish was there"
All patriotic Indians should get united to stop these types of atrocities in India in future by these jihadi mindset people.
Peaceful and resolute protests defeated fascist arrogance. Next is CAA/NRC.

I am proud and happy that our country's citizens are taking ecological and sustainable concepts seriously.This was though these kind of analysis were also required in 1970's but it's never too late.
"The way Sunny Deol is portrayed, he can alone handle thousands of ppl but where is that rat hiding.. love for farmers "

"Thank you sir for explaining in so simple way, I don't understand why officials can't sees these cons while everyone else can"
Got goosebumps. Thank you for this video Abhi Niyu. I literally cried on this day after seeing this violence on Republic Day. 
The background score to that poem was awesome. Gave Goosebumps.
I am from bihar my whole family is in farming but they don't think there is any problem with this law because bihar don't get any benefit of green revolution and other farmers in my village are also have no problem.
Pratik Gupta deserves praise for this effort.. as stated these kulaks in up punjab Haryana need to hear ...

"Govt. bills, policy and 'Sarkari Yojna' mane prokolpo guli niye video upload korle valo hoy. I hope, I shall get to see the expected videos bro. Thanks."
Farmers cannot go to Delhi due to Corona but Amit Shah can go to Hyderabad hipocrisy
The farmers are Bravehearts 
"Sir,bill no where says about msp,APMC closure etc. But indirectly  causes closure/end of same.if YouTube channel subscribers are left with choice to subscribe only one channel in youtube,the person who offers best content or better price, slowly gets maximum subscribers and such subscribers will have no option but leave your  YouTube channel. According to me atleast."
Did govt wanted that incident to happen ?
"If these people had the wherewithal to differentiate between what's sensible and what isn't, they would not be ""poor"" farmers. The fact that anyone is supporting these protests is a reflection of their political leanings. Nothing to do with the policies themselves, but who implemented the policies. Protest and die of covid. That is the fate you have chosen."
Kisan are not under stand thebill. Congrssi kidanoko vadka rahie only for votes
"Modi prepared for ""Hindu - Muslim"" while Our FARMER'S came out of the syllabus "
One point msp is trade distorting and India has wto pressure to end it
Boycott should be of Godi media & its News papers too by all kissan families.
At 1:04 why did that policeman try to stop the other one
Respect to the video editor
All BJP leader Chor hai
Best and deep information for farmer.

"Bihar de-institutionalised APMC mandis in 2006, if i am not wrong. Why the prices are not remunerative for Bihari farmers ? "
"The view that village people , who live by farming , do not understand and dont do  corruption is misguided and naive , corruption is not limited to city people , some of these farmers whom we sympathaize with instantly without thinking because they are farmers wearing simple dhoti ,  are just as corrupt as any corrupt politician or officer , how corrupt are they to protest against free market ?"
Obsession of #endian media with Imran khan is just another level.
"Currently, there is a flaw in our economic theory - monetary value is based on products & services, whereas functional #ecosystems (the SOURCE), have none. These unproductive farmers just like sitting in the middle of the road and do nothing and just criticize someone who's trying to bring the change, we just cannot continue using urea to increase the yield of crops, bees are dying, water resources are overused, no electricity for the general population  (free to farmers) and so many dysfunctional advantages to these slow-witted farmers, my dad started organic farming and increased his income 4 times. We just need to go back to the old ways of farming. Also, @bbc you guys love flying drones over dead bodies and other people's miseries ..shame on BBC!"
"Dear Farmer protestors,"
Great job the wire media and team.
Yaar really ? Saugat ? Could your script writers have not  look for a better word? Bhai salute hai aapki creativity pe
simply waste of time y they are protesting when it is already suspended for 2yrs..... lol...
"There will be time, when these kisans will beg for exactly these three laws, but no one will be available to support them. "
Not expected this...
Farmers are backbone of India but the real farmers are in farm land
"""Farmer's"" , all honest activities and all honest protests...."
There are modern techniques like hydroponic vertical farming animal husbandary in farm to get high income
7 . Lateral entry in IAS posts ....Apas hoga?. wherein NALAYEK  candidate goes to IAS chair without any exam
These are facts in our view -  thats what the world commonly calls opinions . Would SG keep a straight face if Rahul Gandhi or Modi said that ?
Yeah that's the spirit
Support from Andhra Pradesh 
Thanks  vice news...  From Punjab from India...  For showing us  .  And what  we actually  need.
Handover Afghanistan to China otherwise peace never come to there it is great threat to people of Afghanistan as well as global peace
"Sikhs don't pray to  ""Devi-devte"" sikh's pray straight to ""akal purakh"" God. it is hurtful to Sikhs whenever he says ""Devi-devete"" . These mistakes are done on purpose to show that sikh's are hindu's. Sikhs respect all religions and can die to protect people of all faith."
This current situation which we seein India is exactly why RSS exists
Both farmers and police suffering due to modi govt
Really beautiful
"Like most Punjabi Hindus from a pind, my family does farming and we vote BJP more so than Congress lately (grandfather time period and beyond used to be strong Congress supporters. No other choice.). My family is active at local level in Panchayat and also at the protests. Political affiliation does not come before your livelihood and the wellbeing of your people. The idea that only Sikhs are going to the protests is all media propaganda. Sikh is 57% of Punjab; rest is Hindu. Haryana is also mostly Hindu and 5% Sikh. The protests are overwhelmingly Hindu, but media will only show Sikhs wearing dastar to make rest of India buy into this ""otherism."" This is not a religious issue; its a livelihood issue. Only people who are farmers and come from these families understand how it is going to impact us now and in the future, whether they are Hindu, Sikh, Muslim, etc Punjabi's or Haryanvi's. People in the city won't understand and they have proved it."
Take action against terrorists
"around 600 kissans died while agitating ,y PM not requesting them to pardon him for being failed in supporting them,unfortunate that the country is facing lots of crisis since 2014"
Ppl working in fields does not know benefits of farm laws but ppl sitting on youtube knows benefits. 
It mean pakistan is that much competent to defeat india and USA in Afghanistan? 
Tractor police sey apna bchaav kr rhe hai
Its our Delhi we are paying taxes to make Delhi look beautiful however there is no use of damaging public property. Vaise hi India is already way far behind other countries ye Sb karke or piche kardo ki develop hi naa ho paaye.
Hope people stop watching   Main stream media
Finally they succeed..A big salute and thanks to all farmers who struggled alot to repeal farmer laws..this protest end up after one year..largest nd longest protest in human historyRIP all those farmers who lost their lives while struggling against these laws....i wish indian government will understand people to make their life better instead of ruining their life
"The farmers are the backbone of this country ,not the politicians? The farmers need to stay United and teach this government what Governance is??"
They have no r8 to live in India
I am very happy with this new situation as are most genuine farmers I know in Coastal AP.
"Ya I am worse worse"" than others... "
"Indian Democracy already facing problem with Cast,Creed, Religion, Language etc. Now Kisan politics by rich Kisans of Hindi Speaking States has become one more headache. Media can help."
The fears of price rise expressed due to big players comming in seems baseless as import can be opened up then. Diversity in crop plantation would be another benefit.
I was too ignorant of this issue. Thank you very much for bringing this into light in such simple straightforward terms. I wonder why there are no such protests in South india too
Now farmers should move to Delhi Parliament and India gate Lal Qila
Great day for democracy. Government acted in accordance with citizens demands.
Only they know....How painfully they passing their days.....Nd our beloved Besharm PM is naming them Andolanjivi.
There should be serenity in Afghanistan by hook or by crook.
This is high time . If u r protesting against bjp u will be crushed under the tyres of BJP leader's cars . What a shame for this country. Can't even imagine.
I stand by farmers 
You are very good
And all are either farmer's brothers or their sons
The goondas won. Real farmers like Ambani and Adani will suffer. Sad day for india.
You said it's only good in theory....have you tried it practically ?...I'm not the bhakt but still this question came in my head so I asked
"Shame on you ,4 farmer died ,and you noting said about this"
Modi had to take his actions back
"Kisans shall not be fooled by this announcement. Its all because of the upcoming elections in Punjab and UP.  Rakesh Tikait must continue the opposition. If BJP wins elections; it will bring these laws back with vengeance, more vigorously..."
Wow indian mohdi government is so horrible to these punjabis.... khalistan zindabad
This is a a showbiz taliban want to fool us that they are independent and do not obey Pak by the advice of ISI of course but they fail to act properly  just like Peshawri films. 
He cannot blame Congress anymore. Farmers genuinely believe that their survival is threatened.
Wow what a actor itna bada actor hai salary kitni hogi 
If this is happening in India what is to say it won't happen in the north and south . 
What is going on there.... I don't understand. After they can normally going to they normally. How can police and government or people can accept this thing
Taliban..... government????
Kishan aandolan+ congress= pakistan + china support

Please save our India 
"Rich Farmers and Middle man weren't happy with the Bill, they completely ignored the poor farmers, REAL FARMERS who commits SUICIDES, who work in sun bare foot, who sometime merely able to feed his kids a day meal. "
Salute to you Modi sir... We strongly want your leadership for next 15 years
Less government involvement is always better.
"Excellent explanation and good clarification, Dr. Manish. The bill sounds very much in favor of the farmers of every scale. However, I would like to know more about the contract farming. Is it some kind of a secured loan contract? How is the responsibility of the contract deal is shared between the company and the farmer(s)? My concern is if the produce get damaged for some reason, say flood, pest attack, less or too much rainfall, etc. and it ends up into a loss, how does the contract affect the farmers? I am not a farmer but just want to know the situation for my personal learning. Thank you."
"2:23 if kisans dont get their rights, half of the country will starve and they say that protest is only valid until it doesnt interrupt others business"
Thanks sister for supporting Kisan mazdoor
Modi should pay Tribute to The Shaheed farmers and apologize instead of still trying to prove that he was Rite.
Proud to be an India 
Really very nice video 
Incredible. Last year we saw the heinous riot and this year the farmer protest. Both are poles apart in their executions. Solute  to  the farmers.
MSP is all about crops it's not includes milk and sugercane so Shanta Kumar committee calculation was related to only wheat and paddy. So if we include other crops of msp regime it may go to 9-10% but not more than that
Now dakait will Say supreme court bik gya h.
What an attitude  when he says  ban Karo Taliban KO  he knows that India will never ban Taliban 
If this SDM will deny for the orders he given to the police would have to face music in front of of honorable Court. Video of SDM is full flaged evidence against SDM.
Power of farmers 
Very good Decision taken by You Sir Ji I heartily respect you and your all Decisions 
"BJP bhi ab Vote party hai , "
"2018 me MSP ka koi value hi nahi hain . After 2013 farmers ki halat bahot kharab ho gai hain. We logo ko milna chahiye wo price nahi milta.Isliye to 2012 me pyaj 56rupees kg onion milta tha , aur aajkal 60 rupees se 70rupees per kg  tak , petrol ke bhav 70 se 80 rupees ke bich litre mil raha hain . Jabki petrol ka bhav pura internationally kam hain , petrol ka bhav sabse kam hain aajkal international price , even pakistan me 52 rupees litre petrol milta hain aur hamare india me 70rupees .Ye hain modhye sarkar."
"I support Farmers,God Bless all"

Do justice vid them
"yeah he is the same person who said ""aandolan jeevi"" & now see this"
They are Khalistan workers
Good explanation law is good for farmer's and people of India except middleman .
Thanks alot Samdish Sir for your support and reporting .m from punjab and being a farmer's daughter initially we all were panic about our future but now it seems with real media's support we will definitely win.and one more thing the way you use punjabi accent is really nice 
Justice For Kishan Bharwad
We are with farmers.....jai kisan
"The driver was lynched, was his family visited?"
"Absolutely correct to you Rakesh Tikait ji, Kisan-Mazdoor Eikta Jindabad..!"
He   listen   all   questions   but   he   does    not    have    answer  so    keep quiet.

"Arfa, you are an example for a good journalist."
Pray for a better tomorrow 
Its Sad but True. BJP got sold out for votes. Farmers lost.
"Even so, a very bad precedent set up by government!"
The things&acts done by TMC nd AAP MP's were very democratic 
Government says GHAR VAPSEE. Not the kisans!!
Rakesh Tikait says so simply and straightforward
"Now, the turn of the Hindu community to decide ,  how-to face   the devil and sea, an external enemy like Taliban and internal enemy congs aim of both of them is same,"
Bobdi should now know how India became independent...British were not getting Lagaan from farmers and their products were denied..how were they supposed to thrive... Great example of Gandhian principle again by farmers
Govt of india is responsible for tht not farmers
Saudi Arabia also not allowing women cricket team or like that. Saudi Arabia will not allow any type of protest. Saudi Arabia follows the Islamic Shariah law. Thaliban also following the same Sharia law. First criticize Saudi Arabia if you have the guts
"Everyone is at fault farmers, capitalists, government everyone and the sad thing is none of them are concerned about the main issue.... Just money and mandi are the issues for them..... No one is looking at the bigger picture of the works they are doing and have done in the past"
Many thanks to the team for making this EXTREMELY IMPORTANT video cut out.
This  one going to be Historic prime time.
Dear RSS  and BJP goons please go to Afghanistan  and give them freedom from Taliban and help Afghans.   
"Also, have you bothered speaking to any farmer before coming to the conclusion? Maybe go to the protest site and speak to them and then share your perspective??? Itll be a little more responsible of you."
Love u delhi this is why every protest held there thanks for supporting 
May be its for elections but government has to understand that they were imposing unwanted laws.
This channel is amazing. Amit ji: please explain RERA or provide link if you've already done so (I couldn't find it on your channel).
Hathras pe hasss rahi hai yeh political activist shame on you ediot
Well explained Samdish 
Seize their land and tractor s ... follow yogi way
Indian Army best in the world 
MRP will be suitable factor to value farming outputs .
(a) Farmers (b) Bharat (c)Opposition party (d)Dividend if any to be garnered in the coming UP and Punjab election (e) His Modiness gilding his image away from a mere politician to a statesman?
They should protest like Mahatma Gandhi not by this way
A real honest man
Mr Chadda may now like to change his glasses after his comment that Farmers are loosing support....
almost all of the farmers from the country support these laws. Only these stupid farmers from one state Punjab are fighting to protect their and their middlemen priviliges and cartles on the expense of all the farmers across the country. 
Sainik or Kisan are real hero of our Country...Please Respect of Farmers .
Very clearly explained the good as well as bad
"There will be a time when andhbhakts will cry after realizing what they did,and no one will be helping them that time,just wait for that time to come"
Thanks for using breach word because these gawars do not know the protocol and rules.
Far better than the treatment of farmers protest...
Pratik Sir! Your way of explaining things and providing appropriate insights is much relevant and peaceful. Thankyou team Drishti IAS!
Vo log sthank log nhii..RSS vale log hain...aur sbhi sthank log farmers ke sath hain...police vale aur RSS vale unn pr hmla kr rhe the...
Modi should take the responsibility..
But nice good things for farmers and all indians.
Hats off Northern Alliance  World need to support Northern Alliance.

Finally mera lakhimpur famous  ho gaya
Pulses import band kijiye
"Praying for sanity, wisdom and harmony to prevail! "
"Now, Global image and appeasement has become more important than real reforms that can benefit the society."
If  you think that you are reporting true than please clear me if im lost my path
Not only that the protest is funded by anti national organisations and Greta Thunberg shared the full kit of there plan on the internet.....atleast reasearch properly and see both sides point of view ...........
Take good time before taking any decision once you take it never regret he is not sigma 
"Sir, this creates a doubtful situation, if again any massive protest start govt will  take its step back, this step give people strength to do the same for other laws, these protests done by punjab and haryana farmers what about those farmers who are in support of this law they suffer before this law and they are going to suffer after this step. Farmers of Bihar UP MP and other state are not rich like punjab and haryana farmers, many farmers of Bihar left their farming and start doing day labour work in other state, neither the state govt of Bihar do any betterment of the state nor central govt look into this matter."
We bankers also supported them by observing strike on 26th. Actually I went to office but still marked strike. Wage cut? I want to show my support.
What's happening with the Farmers of our country May God have mercy on deceased 
This video is from when protests even started strange 
STAND with FARMERS! Yes we are  Thanks for your ground reporting maam.
This is a huge bloody mess that's not going to end soon or will it end ever ? 
Soo much of fake ID's in comment section
Strongly support it and thanks sir to make things too much clear for us.. We r fortunate to get such a knowledgeable clip provided by u.. Thanks a lot again...
"You said it right there in the beginning of the video ... ""Farm laws are by en-large mostly beneficial to the farmers"",   People hate changes and yet they want changes."
"Dear Sir,  Tikait Saab's detailed explanations in this interview is simply very fantastic, Sir. Hats off to you, Sir. Dear Sir,  the Ads appearing in your videos, also, simply very supportive and also superb,  Sir. Salaams. "
 everything is passed without prober debate.
Farmers have done their job now our turn to crush these Modi media.
"The bottom line is that India cannot reform its economy and progress. No matters how much discussion and consensus building you do, opposition will always oppose and stall any reforms because this is how they gain politically. This is true for all patties."
Dont act like godi well boycott you too 
"May it be a  Condolene meeting, or  Convocation."
Modi creates a rift between Kisan and Jawan. Ex-servicemen protest and tents uprooted in 2015
Thank you Shekhar Guptaji for doing a good job in explaining how the MSP being introduce to India and what were its benefits during the starvation year.
The farmers asking to repeal these laws completely isn't going to help the farming community in India. They should have asked for proper changes in areas of concern.
"Loved the way u defended ""das"" "
Bjp rss go back
"Madam, you have not studied the text in the farm laws, please, read it clearly.."
As always govt is befooling farmers to satisfy their own political and corporate interests
Now I don't support Farmers. They are not Indian. They proved this. They insulted Indian flag. An Indian can't do this. And some Punjabi people are supporting them just because they are thinking that They are Punjabis. They don't think that what is right and what is wrong.
"Sardar g is well informed and talks clearly about his right to protest, why is the police pointlessly arguing with them knowing that corona pandemic is just a shield that BJP is using to protect themselves from being unveiled."
All hail farmers 
Fact ye h jb kisan ni chahti to sarkar q bechain h
Great  victory for our farmers Jai Jawan Jai Kisan or bhakto ko sahanubhuti unka appa na bill wapas la liya
"""Those who make's peaceful revolution impossible, will make violent revolution inevitable."""
"I see some rational people who understood the fact that these laws were indeed important to bring reforms in Farming sector , where were you , if we were united and fought against political forces this wouldn't have happened"
Minimum support price has often been lower than what it should be and mostly results in loss for the farmers. 
Salute to farmers of the country they remained resolute even after the repeal of farm laws.
These are all done by D company mark my word
"proud of them,and very big thanks to you all for the best coverage ."
Modiji should urgently Remove his Current Political Advisors and the BJP IT Cell to Save their  governments in the Indian states.
Those who hoisted flags on Redfort yestday were the same team Campaigned for Bjp in Loksabha elections for Sunny Deol.
It seems like Modi was and or still is the insult?
"""Bhot liberals ke sath baithte ho tum toh"" kya line hai "
"Any law that hurts Pakistan, implement it!"
Please wait and see what is the outcome of taking back the farm laws.. their is a lot big happening inside and outside  the country this with drawn farmlaws are check mate.....
this is too much ya... she is just on her way to visit the victim family.. let  her go...wtf is this..
Is bache ko pta nhi ki wo kya bol rha hai .. kuch log apne progenda ko chlane k lye bache ka istmal kr rhe hain jo is desh k lye thik nhi hai
As usual... Accurate.. To the point and most importantly unbiased one.. U guys are gem 
5. Compromising / undermining realisation of GDP
(b) a clear price reference for any additional amount over and above the
"As a ex army officer . I would like to compliment the police forces involved in this shameful affair . I salute your perseverance , patience and dedication to duty ... .... It was sheer discipline and leadership that you did not open fire . I compliment the men and officers of the police force . I compliment the Governments masterstroke  in  allowing these mobs to vandalize the city . This brazen  display of crude hooliganism in media glare has ensured that this movement is over .I also invite the so called better trained police of the west in wake of the death of George Floyd to view the restraint of Indian police in much more challenging situations . "
Great tikeat ki salute you from heart
they seem to have reign some control over the  procurement process like  direct transfer to farmer and registration of farm land etc....some purpose of this law is already  in force
Aam Aadmi party work very hard .he Fully support kisan .
Pappu and his jokers party
now also they don't know please explain the laws
I am so sad yaar Kya ho Raha hein....why gvmnt didn't good respond to farmers 
"True , good analysis"
Bought him..for.... These ki dofState leaders in all states have been bought by Bjp
"India will take advanced preemptive defense, which means sending army into Afghanistan."
I agree with farmers
Thank God government  is implementing such laws as they are really helping farmers at the ground level and its sad that so many people can't see it
BJP for blantant lie always
"---Committed massacres of Sikhism, captured their territories and attacked Harmandir Sahib so"
They lost public trust  and proved that they are not farmers and  they havnt any   give and take from farming  
No force on earth can stop punjabies or sardar people 
Bjp is post graduate in creating danga type situation
i really loves it...
"Salute the farmers, they lost the battle but won the war. Pray the day will come when genuine help would help elevate your farming to being more lucrative"
They want to protect the fruits of their HARD WORK
I appreciate our PM for going back on farm law. Even though its late at least now its done. Opp will find bad things in everything so dont worry.
"by Modi government the slogan is Jai Jawan, JAi Digitalise and farmers stop farming, we want to totally remove you from India!"
SDM did what seemed correct. CM is elected representative of people of Haryana. His security can not be compensated. If you don't like him challenge him in next election and bring the amendment. right!!
Shame on BJP... support farmers
BBC always propagate negative news or negative perception about out loving country India.
Talibaan and there civilian are same
No humanity left in Indian police and Government 
"These people are not farmers, they are the middle men who buy produce from farmers at low price and sell them at a higher price in the market."
The major concern is the silent farmers from other states who were in favour of these laws and against these so called farmers agitations... In India the corrupt political and dishonest people are doing everything to destabilise the government but this is not the problem.. The real problem is the majority silent spectators who are unable to raise their voices against dishonesty... The only maximum tool to show their concern is social media messages...
Shame on MODI govt
Panjab is and has been sustaining and feeding the population of whole indian communities and much more.....
"They are sitting near delhi from more than 60 days, No solution has been made yet."
BJP's silence from the time of Shaheen bag then bengal violence and not this...to encouraging goons.. i totally feel bjp is at fault..
This is one of the best videos I have seen about farm bills.
Yea farm laws were a bad decision
Persons in AC room cannot understand the problem of farmers.
There will be no more agents in selling of crops. 
It was hard to determine that what type of crop will be grown by farmers.
"Still adament that there was no fault of Govt so just doing as people were fool to not understand these laws, so nothing changed other than summer ended and election season started."
Modi  ji realy  we are all thank s to u but what about the several  former dide what about that going to tell modi ji ?.
May god save them
Isn't this a violation of the Doha Peace Agreement? Infidels never go by their word
You did not mention the flaws in redressal system.
4:47 Actually farmers was quite....here but the opposing party made it controversial by throwing stone and flames
I stand with farmers rights. No farmer no food.
Anjali Bardhwaj is absolutely correct
My dear meghnad only 6% farmers in nation get benefits of msp. All others get lesser price than msp. I always support your initiative in news media but you have less info on farming just like any other city guy...
India: *Farmers protests*
Wow!!Just loved ur way of explanation. Thank you mam. It's very useful video.
Election coming one and half year in Punjab
Full Mark's to India today for trying to save BJP
We live in an india where reforms are resist
Shame on so called farmer.
Leave our sikh brothers alone
thank you sir offline class you tube pr upload krne k liye
This Farmers protest will end BJP rule in India
I am upsc inspired so this video very clearly understood   farm bills. Sir thank-you so much
Yo thara bhai joginder 
And paying the protestors?! Why?! We're they invited to do so by the government?! They've already caused huge economic losses and discomfort to People and damaged buisness in North West India
700 innocent farmer died #justice
It's not the farmers who were deceased during the protests but it's the *Humanity* which deceased and killed by Government in each & every way possible.
Bhai 12th fail se aur kya ummeed rkh skte h
"I under stood. Govt ,employees will directed to vote for BJP."
"BJP was not really interested in punjab elections, but now as the latest UP opinion polls are saying that bjp is losing some ground because of farmer agitation, they now feel repealing these laws will be like killing two birds with one stone ( UP elections and Punjab elections with Amrindar as CM face)"
Even our media is fucked up. Putting pressure on farmers by making nonsense Alligaitons
"very well explained! Just one suggestion, at the start when you mentioned that the govt provides msp for more than 20 crops, you should have stated the exact number (23). Looking forward for more :)"
Bhai....i prefer seeing you than the 9pm news....now this is what is called ground reporting....Brother you do a great job...may these videos/ information reach to many...may we all start using our common senses more than the phones ...GOD bless you for whatever you do....
"MSP is as buyers of last resort not first resort as it defeats the purpose of free market. The PDS system has to be scraped and that is the fact. It keeps farmers poor, food grains are lost in FCI Warehouses and consumer get poor quality food. If only you can show me a thriving farmer who has actually benefited from MSP otherwise the debate is as poor as our food."
Illuminati politics going to get end in this world.... people will leave peacefully after that
One of the farm laws is that they cannot burn the leftover after harvest by burning a matchstick which is the reason for increasing pollution in northern India and that too msp one of the fears is addressed as it will not be scrapped but still they don't agree they have a right to protest but should be done peacefully
Wowww really appreciable 
"Apart from the content, the way you speak is too good! You are a fantastic orator and while watching you many a times I feel as if I am having a direct conversation with you!"
I come from India where we watch Republic tv for memes.
These are definitely not the farmers. I think enough is enough. In India democracy is being raped and taken for granted everyday. We need a Hitler's rule for a few years to knock these anti social elements.
Happy to see that at least  some media  supporting farmers where most of them are biased and against farmers.
Third commodity act you know. Black marketing. Storages are already built by adani.
Thanks for this comprehensive video 
2022 election aa raha hai
There can't be any complacency on the canceling of farm laws which were not there.Responsible policy makers must bestow sincere efforts to protect the farmers from natural disasters practically avoiding slogans
Horrible and brutal face of the GOVT.
Good job young man. Well explained
"Dear all ,  aren't  v r concerned about well-being of our beloved  Piyush Goyal ji and Narendra   ji ....! Why this bloody  camera hungry   creature  shamelessly  flaunting his  super idiot act that killed so many...."
"all reforms for private will come first' with benifits, continues with exploitation, ends with deaths of the poor, because Indian politics is controlled by corporates. You see the sufferings of Communist China who used their welfare ideologies to corporates . We need proper interactions and convenience the people, if they can not  believe in the speaker or doubts about the future, repeal, . But I also appreciate Narendra Modi Ji for his various initiatives. India born with protest, no army , weapons , Power stopped the Indian freedom from British. Same way once the massprotest is accepted by common people, then governing  leaders need the strategies to stop......."
You know when India got freedom 73 present people was punjabi  ok thats why than tell
"You are very intelligent,why do you not try for IAS"
How good is a law in democracy if so many people are against it?
Except Punjab & Haryana Farmers ! Rest Of India Support Farm Bills !
Jogijii will investigate firmly and punish them hard. I am 100% sure about it. But it will take little time to find the evidence.
"1. If FCI is carrying grain worth 1.8 lakh crores and not able to sell, how is the farmer expected to sell this to corporates?"
"Jo company piche hyay,usko vi tor deo. Those Ministers/ govt "
Which is less production in our country and consume less water
"If farmers are stirred to anger, then they might commit some mistakes by which government will gain the confidence of people for the laws passed."
In the NDTV no anchor is close to Ravish 100 %   Some one are 70 %   80 %  90 %  near to the real recognised
Shame on yogi
Farmers are right bcz privatization always be expensive than govt
Every teacher in this country needs to watch this and learn!
Who are protesting in Delhi against these Law
Rip.. Pray for justice
Shri Modi ji ko salute.  He is greatest son of soil.  I share the feeling of shri Modi ji. 
So we will give time to modi
Govt exhibited weakness... this is not something for which people choose with complete majority
Farmers have right to sell their crops wherever they want... That's freedom.... Also n advise to VOX y don't u compare the farming policy with America's n Europe's policy.....
Please attach pdf sir
"you r great sir ,i really respect you should come on piltics to teach them something"
Dhruv Bhai this is a very slow   eatting process of our country....ye tab se Suru Hogaya...jab Modi digital India ko Bana chahata tha....aur koi nhi..(he know how to cover his actions against public reaction by his words).
After one year of persistence n sacrifice  we won. kisaan ekta zindabad 
I am Support Farmers. Because I am Now In Delhi In Protest
"Strict rule hona chahiye, India jaise country me jahan duniya me sabse jyada freedom hai."
We are protecting our nation not our agriculture only . If these agriculture laws will apply then the first impact will on metropolitan cities.     Farmers of Punjab and Haryana are educated nd captivated.
Lallantop youtube se paise kma kr aaj tak joki india today group ka channel h use derha h aur wo log isi paise se nafrat aur jhhothi khabar faila rhe h
"This sets a very dangerous precedent for any future reforms to be taken. As long as Delhi can be held hostage for long enough time, it can be bent for the demands"
"The farmers have proved that truth triumphstheir persistence, patience and integrity got them through."
Yahi brahminwaad ki cherm seema hai. Mishraji ke beta hai bjp se hai toh kuch bhi kar sakta hai. Brahmin have mindset to crush anyone who wants to equalize with them.
Donald Trump said : I can finish Taliban in one day
We can live without dry fruits from Afghanistan
Super  explanation brother I will share this to my friends  support from Tamilnadu 
"Never take the job of the Speaker. If you take then,  keep a gun."
This is not farmer's
I see a lot of appreciation of this episode. I infact felt this is a rare one sided segment from  Mr shekhar and doesn't actually answer the questions being raised by the people opposing the bill. This analysis is based on the opinions and viewpoints of one economist 'Ashok Ghulati'  who is in favour of this bill. It doesn't address the arguments against the bills and just waives them off saying opposition is political and congress had the same in their manifesto etc.
"My respect for Afghan women as shot up by billion times ,unlike many they don't fight on twitter , they fight at ground zero ."
how can give such a speack after killing all the farmers
Do you have data like over a period of 10 years how much farmers weath against middlemen
Govt. Should make a rule so that all the corporates cannot buy at MSP acc. To swaminathan commission adjusted to inflation.
What am amazing coverage Samdish and Surbhi! Great Job @ScoopWhoop
Modi wearing a saree?
ModiShah has shown skilled politics but not skilled governance 
Vested interests of farm mafia will make whole farmers community suffer from poverty for decades to come. This is defeat of silent majority. Be silent and see your rights and benefits go down the drain one by one due to organized few.
2018 se Taliban se secret meeting kyo chal rahi thi.
As SDM he is taking the right step. I support him. Ye saale kisaan kuch bhi tode aur hum sarr na tode. Fake Farmers.
" Punjab Free electricity should , also , be given to Physically "
Non-cooperation movement was called off by Mahatma Gandhi after Chauri chaura incident ... Will congress call off their support to this protest now ?? 
Instead of wasting money on Bollywood films n making them rich n heroes we should make our military strong they are our real heroes
What that shows? And Modi said he is doing away with black money Bull shit.
Well both the govt and protestors are to blame
"after this video, i have come to a conclusion. Farmers are protesting for a problem that they ""may"" face later on(removing msp). As for the contract farming, no one is forcing farmers for that. You will always have an option to go to apmc or simply deal with the industries directly. Is my conclusion correct? Correct me if i am wrong."
What kind of objectives could drive these people to such an extent ?
Corporates had an eye on massive food grain market of India.They had few problems:
Hm chaina ka products been nhai. Karskte ro chaina se latege
Please make an essay on women officers in armed forces.
"Shameful behavior by bjp and its minister... The Delhi police needs to grow a spine and stop indulgence in inhumane behaviour .. These people don't even want the farmers to have access to drinking water, let alone coming up with positive legislation to help and protect the farmers. Proud of the AAP party, thanks for working for the people?"
Make a video on how 
Shout out to angad Singh and vice news  for this vid
I think hum Indians soport karne chahiye Inhe
"Well done! Finally, someone with sense!"
 The people who come in support of Jihaadi Katwes and Italian Gandhi then you should start thinking of those days and sacrifices before 1947. 
America also did the same by these kind of laws and the small farmers cannot go to other states or even other district to sell their produce that is why the mandi system needs to be stronger
If Farmers don't want reforms then don't give any subsidy and other debt benefits from Tax payers hard earn money.
"Pakistan should return back Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, peshawar and Balochistan to Afghanistan "
Please provide actual data of MSP of every state .sothat it should be clear why all the farmers are not protesting.
Your love and respect for Punjabs and Sikhs is  a blow to the communal
All the support to the farmers.
"Very good explanation, now I understand the intricacies of these bills"
Farmers having their Breakfast while sitting on chairs and most of them having western breakfast only. Businessman Farmers??
Calling sikh community as khalisthanis and 
One aim one moto only oppose. nothing for country.
This is not a farmer protest. This is happen to lose BJP in 2022 Up election. But BJP party will come again in 2022 ....

"Huge respect for you brother, thanks for covering farmers protest"
"Oh i see, people of punjab achieved herd immunity "
the main reason for repealing the agricultural law The army regiments revolted
Haryana government madrch***
He is talking like he did a favor to people by helping them. Look at his tone he speaks like he gave his hard earned money to people. u gave peoples money to people
This 3 law was so muh good for small and medium farmers but this rich broker have played well
Zee media boycott
He is a sikh first and then a BJP leader... Shameful words to the core from him... Also teach him some etiquette and manners on how one conducts themselves in a discussion.. Irritant butting in... Not a word of sympathy...
Di in love with your way of explanation ...... Means your vedios are to the point and easy too understand.....
I think you should make a video on it. 
National flag disrespected
        personally       ego    
"Very aptly put by SG. I was waiting for SG to de-clutter it. However, I don't agree when SG says repeal was the only option left to BJP. They could have made some changes to the law and left it to the states to implement it. States where people are more entrepreneurial in nature like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, might have accepted this law, and Punjab, Haryana, UP could have tried this later."
"Compare this to the times jab war mein sikh shaam ko dushman ko bhi paani pilate the. This is our own govt denying us water to drink, our basic right."
Thank you so much team for covering this !!!
they should leave Taliban alone as majority of people in Afghanistan have decided to choose Taliban over Afghan government.
Kishan bill is nuksan Kon bataye ga...we want truth behind this kishan bill..
"Shame on this policeman. it's not part of their training to put boot and weight on someone face ,neck...sad ..wen system is going to improve ."
This scene is too disturbing .... justice for farmers 
Sister God bless uhh love from Punjab 
Thanks sir & team Drishti
Indians want to hear about black days of emergency. 
these so called Kisan  leader?  For there harrassment of local people
"For telling the truth about the farmer, thank you from the heart, with your right knowledge, the country is becoming young, strong, the future of India is getting brighter."
"It's really a tregedy that people did not understand . India doesn't need reform , let us mantain status quo , hope that from now onwards no farmer will commit suicide and if ever a farmer commits suicide then let's these leaders ie , priyanka gandhi , Akhilesh Yadav , kejirwal etc come forward to take the responsibility , India has decided to remain in the last century in farming sector"
"Anchor's questions are like a BJP lover, this people make a situation political, communal...."
I think you should also start Group Discussion(means pros and cons) on different topics.I am watching this video for Group Discussion in airforce.
Very good farmers 
"hahaha..great video.. This actually sounds pretty good, MSP for security and free market for prosperity. Lot of farm produce get wasted in India, this will actually help reduce the time to sell these perishable goods and reduce hoarding, but may also lead to large scale industrial farming and totally push the poor farmers off the equation. It's high time people left all the farming to automated machines, easier said than done though."
Hypocrites and their hypocrisies are bound by their selfishness
"I'm sure he has planned something bigger in some other field, that's why this move has come so that they can  take the pressure off from here and move forward in some other field."
Omg - its about time... im not indian nor a farmer... modi has done some good things for his nation but this farmer law was ridiculous... I think india needs a new leader and direction.
Shame shame BJP bhagao desh bachao.. respect farmers 
Sardaro utho this time is good for khalistan
"Thank you BBC for continued coverage of Indian Farners. They're struggle is like looking in to the past and future for all farming and agriculture around the world. Past, from US agriculture perspective, where farmers are forever in debt and it's easier to conglomerate until a few big companies manage all the farming land. Future, because all other countries that have yet to admit big agricultural companies can see how profits over people will crush their current community structure.  like watching a slow steamroller raise your house."
"I agree with you sir but Modi is never say die type: Gurcharan das he will fit out sth better, for the time being Aartiyaa(money lenders of sort) have won by befooling the illiterates."
2: play whole video to decide what's wrong.
"Your reporting is favorable to farmers of Punjab and Haryana. Hope you take opinions of other farmers of the rest of India. You know how much soil exploitation is happening in Punjab and Haryana to just dump overloads of rice and wheat in those APMC stores? They are taking huge benefit of present system. Despite government gave written assurance that MSP will not be removed, the protests are biased like your reporting is. Thought newslaundry was unbiased. Your reporting suggests there should be no competition. Yes privatisation leads to competition and monopoly, but it cannot survive without innovation, so bsnl vs jio, nokia vs iPhone, Ford vs Tesla, HAL vs Dassault, people should be proud of Indian make and Indian PSUs, but should not be blind to fairness. You are reporting in such a way that you are supporting lethargistic people. Media should be totally neutral, unbiased and cover the whole regional opinions when reporting to whole India. I expected that from newslaundry. I can't expect it from many others as they are biased, because as it is that they take payments through advertisement. When reporting only to Punjab, your report is very good."
"4:20- 4:55. wow. So from here on out , your whole argument is only about the surplus crops a farmer has after he has sold his main crop at a previously decided price to a corporate. How much is that surplus? 1%, 2%, 5%? How much is it? This is us heading into conjecture territory now. Surplus only. He won't be able to sell the surplus for the MSP which will lead to a fall of overall prices and the farmers will lose negotiating power because of that surplus crop that in this hypothetical scenario could not be sold? Kuch sense hui is baat ki? 10% maan liya surplus.  10% crop will cause remaining 90% crop value to crash? Are you serious ? and for comparison this already has happened in milk, poultry, fish and they all do better than cereals and sugarcane, which are the main beneficiaries of MSP and untold subsidies upto the tune of 1.22 lakhs per family in Punjab. Why has it not happened there?   Hum khote hain kya?(Jab we met style). Chao aage badho. Aur gyaan de hi do aaj"
"and ask about EMPLOYMENT, ECONOMY , CURRUPTION , FOOD SECURITY and lastly link with AMBANI n ADANI   ."
Humble request to punjab farmers to stop protest...
You were equally responsible for the success of this movement. Thanks Ajit Anjum ji.
"If the crowd is unarmed and not violent, the authority does not have any right to lathi charge the protesters. Brutal force shouldn't be overused."

What about the 700 Farmer (Shaheed) ?
It's nothing wrong if three laws are rolled back on understanding people's pain.
