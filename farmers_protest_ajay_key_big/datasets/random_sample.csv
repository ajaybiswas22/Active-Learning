We stand United with farmers. Down  to modi government
"Farmers want that msp written mein btayi jaye ki konsi crop pe kitna milega,,,"
Manisha mocks Sudhir.. I laughed like lotpot 
Black day for farmers this day will be remembered  where reform lost and hooligans won
"Farmers also feel, after implementation they will start selling their crops to the Corporates not the local mandis to get better prices which (in few years) might result in the end of local mandis. Once the deserted mandis are removed by the govt (shown as loss) the real face of the corporate would show up and the farmers will lose bargaining power to big corporations in the absence of MSP & APMC)"
Dirty trick department is fully loaded and active. Saavdhaan
"Govt. is for everyone, but is not with anyone."
cool journalism .....respect to farmers from Nepal.....all the best for ur rights !!!!
"Great leader kejriwal sir, CM of Delhi"
You are a blessing for India Khan Sir..  Jai Hind 
"Farmers already could sell ( before these 3 bills) to private sellers dude , in which world are you living PRATIK?"
Agenda of khangress+pakistan+Urban naxals+khalistani supporters Completely exposed now.
The person who is killed is lakhbeer Singh from punjab shocked to see how any Sikh can disrespect guru granth sahib ...Why Zee tv is showing unknown person ...he is lakhbeer Singh killed by nihangs ..not gd at all
"Another thing you talked about is that a farmer can't sell beyond his area's mandi, well he can a lot of farmers of punjab sell the basmati rice crop at mandis in haryana. so mandi freedom is already there."
"Please don't call them islamist; Islam has no relation to this, these are just a political group."
"So basically you are worried about Monopoly in this sector, well we already have laws for that. If a corporation starts exploiting of the farmers or consumers then both will shift to another company. Market competition needs to be maintained and that is where govt steps in. Ask yourself, why is internet in India so cheap?? It's because of market competition, and buddy it works wonders."
Just a question. Remember how there were reporters reporting from HK like it was a show. And yet the worlds media are not here following the protestors around? 
we are with the farmers who are feeding more than 100 crores citizens and exporting food grains to many countries.
Corrupted system going on with innocent people
"Modi, The Great Liar"
Please help me 
Thnx BBC for support farmers
Who is watching After Kissan Protest ?
Poision congress maafiya applied anti india activity
Patthar chal rahe the aur goliyan phenke jaa rhe the!! 
PS- central ground water board in 2019 said that Punjab and haryana would be desert in 15-20 years if don't change farming practices.
Maulanas don't do murders you fools. They are as like priests and sadhu sants.
3. I do agree that there will be an increased intervention by private players in the farm produce sector however at every point the farmer is the decision making authority wether they wanna deal at APMC mandis or Direct to buyer and wether they wanna get into a finite contract with a private buyer or they wish to sell their produce as they have been doing all this while. 
"this is only digital media platform that doesn't speak the truth..  To whatever extent the wrong committed by the leaders of ruling govt, it will always report in support of them, trying to justify those wrongs..."
Think from point of open market
Omg we are lucky we Born in india

Only Teachers can change our Society...I'm not a Ias aspirant but I am desperately waiting to know your  point of view. Thank you sir...
Just before passing these 3 farm laws parliament has also accepted a modified APMC act. Can u please explain the need to come with new laws in just 4  months.
Punjab and Haryana want the monoply to continue so they can keep getting the money whilst the rest of the farmers die.
Kahi election to ni ho rahe hai? 
Please stop this BJP
There is a difference btw other youtubers and abhi n niyu which is seen here by not adding adds in this video.
Punjab farmers has save india from acute hunger and now it is time for entire India take a stand for India farmers.

Punjab just kept fulfilling the requirements of wheat and rice for whole india but couldnt do enough for itself. . 
Modern history ke aapka lagbhag savi video dekha aur bahut kuchh sikha. Modern history itna sufficient hai baki jo remaining hai Modern history me wo self study se surely ho jayega kyonki concept clear ho chuka hai
Thanks Vice News! Finally a fine content.
"I was searching for knowledgeable video. Sorry! I think, i have arrived at wrong destination.. You please keep going. "
Well said. Who is the India to intervene in the matters of other countries? It is the Afghan Public who ll decide!!
If the government is in favour of our farmers.. That is the three law is not harmful to them then it should be proved by effecting step and realised the farmers that all are in their favour or remove the law by which everything will be okay... Otherwise the farmers who take such will never come back... and the situation may be very harmful
Vo police man jisne ek old age farmer par laathi uthai sharam karo
"Some points, you have said, is not true. So please review again. "
Expected a lot better from News Laundry. No wonder it has less than 250K views.
The number of unmasked people is nauseating. I fear for the amount of lives lost.
 Instead of subsidies it's better to give good price for farm products.
"Thirdly, it is alleged that agriculture is highly subsidized, though subsidies in US and other developed countries are much higher. These have adverse consequences such as Punjabs free electricity is causing steep fall in sub-soil water table. The problem begs a solution, but the reforms remain silent. Incidentally, Punjab pays the cost of free electricity from its budget and, thus ends up subsiding the national buffer food stock.  "
Sikh hearts are leaving treacherous India.
Respected prime minister  Modi ji immediate withdrawal farmers against New three law. Don't waste off time . Former strike it created comen public side   your government administration conditions  unsatisfaction.  this situation definitely effect coming Tamil Nadu assembly election. so immediate solve farmers laws .

Kisaan ??? Ye kisaan hain?? Jo ek car ko corner kar raha hain?? Bloody Pappu and congress always vulture politics
Shame on tehreek-e taliban.... What the hell are you doing... Come all rise and conquer Pakistan
Watch this video. https://youtu.be/VRPjeCmkeHo. About Ten years back Mrs Shushma Swaraj was opposing vehemently the farm reforms introduced by the then Congress party in the Parliament. She was telling what now the Panjab farmers are telling.   
Sir please can you make a video on Maharashtra gov. proposing the exclusion of many villages from green zone for mining.
"It's not breakthrough for Farmers, but for Yogi Das and for bjp for their next Assembly elections in UP and other states."
After viewing this all supporters of BJP and RSS should strongly write to PMO to Re -
Damn shocking and totally inhumane... Rakshak is now bhakshak...
PM can call an emergency Parliamentary session to revoke/remove this bill but fooling Farmers He establish himself as a drama king or a fenku Farmers dont trust him any more you will see will start another issue like hindu muslim or Pakistan then Kashmir issue to fade And finish Kisan Andolan
Totally devastated after seeing this ....how could somone that cruel...
BJP is in big trouble now! Modi made a mistake of underestimating Indian farmers!
Wow that is nice background lucky my dhruv bhai with good news
Its time for india and other european countries to come along with usa with military support and assistance to support afghan army.
What is the price of telling truth that you are paying?
Jay hind.
was our farmers were happy before these farm laws ? Do our country farmers dont want any new farm laws ammendments ?
Taking back of agriculture reform laws was not expected.First of its kind.
NOW COMMON PEOPLE BLOCK PUNJAB NATIONAL BORDER ... DON'T LET DAILY ESSENTIALs to reach punjab

sad visual sadly we cannot do anything even after watching this sorry.
*Sad truth but whoever sits as president didn't care about seafarers*
Finally andolanjeevi rocked takla shocked.
what are the oppoosition saying ... they have all also aided in passing of the bill  .the bill was passed due to lack of power of opposition now they have mouth and brains of a philosipher
"So staggering to see this cathasthrope, iam dolorous feel in my heart for Afghan people.. God help afghanistan"
"Mr. Shekhar Gupta: I am pointing out another case of the government's inaction. We know our most difficult neighbor is Pakistan and Pakistan's brain sits in Lahore, a city of 1.25 crore population and the capital of its most populous province Punjab. Both Lahore and Amritsar are considered twin cities. Dr. Manmohan Singh wanted to reach out to the intelligentcia of Lahore from its closest window in Amritsar. He started the construction of an FM tower 300 meters high in 2006, but 15 years in the works, this high powered external service radio station has not become operational. Pakistan is talking to Amritsar using a battery of 6 radio transmitters 3 high powered medium-wave transmitters and 3 FM transmitters. In return we can't make even one high powered FM transmitter operational. Modi government's left hand does not know what its right hand is doing."
Watch punjabi media... to know where these leaders actually stay . U bjp 
An year long battle (ordeal) of KISAN against the blind /deaf ruling class will go a long way in the history of working class of the country. 
"But if you think that Kashmiri people can be killed very easily because they are Muslims,"
Pak and us made biggest strategic blunder by creating a monster which is fuelled by ideology. They forget if taliban become strong they will definitely interfere in pak affairs. Its already happening. Ironically pm of pak and army celebrating this strategic blunder. In the long term this blunder affect everyone.
Maturity from a leader's point. Still farmers are at loss here.
"1. There is no such  'safety net' decided by FCI during procurement of foodgrains. FCI purchases all the arrived stock in mandi from farmers through comission agents. And past two years, FCI strictly ensure every single payment of foodgrains to the concerned farmers by the bank statement of comission agents. This marketing season, FCI have developed mechanism of directly payment to the farmers which brings more transparency."
Now I can understand why india is not developing
"Bjp it cell active for manipulative facts, didi you know these bills are beneficial for corporate world not for farmers , but you actually diverting the mind of people against farmers"
"Is it difficult to get justice, there is someone who can take the hand of the oppressor"
This is what happens when somebody who doesn't know hoots about India & it's farming issues tries to support under the garb of being funny... Trevor expected better research .... No wonder they day agendas drive social media these days...
Democracy is achieved by reasoning which has not happened last six years and I presume will continue to happen as long as this government takes abrupt desicion
"When you get fix income by doing the same thing, why change. Privileges are hard to get rid off. At the end of the farmers are also human beings."
"More than Thousands farmer,not public or any students,The farmers themselves are coming today to join the protest,waiting there without their wife and children,Media is covering the entire situation and The Indian Government is not coming forward to have a negotiate with them? "
Pls tell ur life story sir
Yes Rahul must be going round n round every night in Red light district to watch diversity. By the way its legal along with Bollywood entertainment at certain coffee shops. He certainly has not gone there to study Van Gaugh as he hasnt capacity in his brain.....:):):) JaiHind...
Modi is a Trumper.
Those farmers who want those 3 Bill's should start protest now. 
Good. Hope all concerned parties drop their ego in favour of the bottom farmer and end user (consumer). 
"   India has become surplus in agricultural produce , long back. "
Sir you are disgracing farmers agitation by calling it political. What is the use of MSP if procurement is not gurrenteed?
Jo life loss hua hai...ruling govt. Ki jidd ki wajah se ask for their rights as well... hats off to alll farmers 
More suggestions of replicable nature will follow.
Very well explained; shouldnt the demand of farmers to be met ; and modi and Bjp  group can take some lesson from this reporter.
"Government decided to repeal, 3 Farm Laws,  details are mentioned by Shri Narendra Modi, P.M.,"
"APMC : example of Bihar, APMC got fail"
Talk to farmers and their kids before making such video dont believe in lies of these economic and leaders as they personally dont do there things and just build up talks
"Everything has been exposed now, and hope real farmers undertand it, bcs they themselves supported the bills earlier. Thanks to Re-Greta Thunburg !  #GretaThunburgExposed"
Uttar pradesh will never change  hopeless state
Indian government needs to withdraw the new agriculture laws
Time to rethink how they select and train civil servants.
Minister must go. For what? This is not the Sanjay Gandhi era where mother is prime minister and son is super prime minister.
See how conveniently you have side stepped  the money power of the Punjab Aditya brokers and their hold on the Punjab farming  communities. The farm brokers are as powerful as the Zamindar- Army combination of Pakistan. It is time to smash this and only Modi is capable of doing it.
idea is rules and regulations about import and export. If you see Lahore
"These Andolan will flout all rules. Shame to see AAP, congress behind scene."
Govt understand the protest today what a joke.
@Shekar Gupta : It is good that you have done good VIDEO without BIAS...Congrats!!! Continue...Good should be reported as Good and Bad is Bad...Thats it...
Anna who begot Kejruddin.
One of Kannada news channel is been banned bcoz they revealed all scam done by karnataka C M son plz make video about this
No fixed income for farmers. Everyone gets fixed salary. Repealing 3 law doesn't make any sense.
"Why India under is 800 year colonial rule because of our own people ,this farm law is the prime example"
Jai Guru govind ji formed a movement against Islamic fundamentalists by creating panch pyaras.
"When Taliban proclaim sharia laws for Afghans, how can they indulge in business of opium ? It is contradiction of  preaching and practicing."
Protestors blocked major roads for 6 months. If eventually govt had to surrender under illegal pressure then why they made common local residences to suffer?
Shame on republic you should show car running over innocent farmers republic is biased...
4. If all crops in the country are bought then what shall we do with the crops left in the country after consumption?
Aditi ji you know how to shutdown a wrong argument great job and congie bsp sp have nothing but make trouble for people so keep on going you are doing a great service to the nation 
Election jeet na bhi hai issi liye repeal kiya.
Now I support for Hindu rashtra.

"Modi is  good  actor  in Indian film industry ,,,   ,who says Modi can't change and play the roll,, Modi's acting killed a lot of people that""s why he become a , I want to present him Padmashree, cool"
Very strong opinion against BJP govt but how come they wins the election all the time. It doesn't make any sense.
"For those of you just want to watch the bill withdrawal declaration, watch from 14:10"
"If the protection is concrete and gives absolute protection to favor the farmers then I will be very happy, because anyway the companies will have to do their trade and balance, so if they are into small trading business they will have to get through for survival in the market, this is where the very big companies like Reliance/Wallmart come because they could beat any market including mandi, because he could be initially buying the goods at the best price to keep the monopoly and crash all the big players to dept and then sell and buy the produce at the price he wishes later on to the future. "
I stand with farmers of my Nation
Just imagine how the country would have been if Indian Journalism had people like Dhruv Rathee
Zee news or kitna girna chahte ho?
Thank you so much LALLANTOP TEAM for showing the Truth. This is the best documentary and thank for putting subtitles in English that I can forward this documentary to some of my friends who doesn't speak punjabi and Hindi.
"After elections, he should face the heat & will repent of gathered for yogi & BJP"
Obviously we students understand that. That's why we SFI protested in our areas supporting our Annadata!
Now indian farmers could earn equaivalent to American farmers now 
"This is the power of Democracy, power of Vote,Salute to beloved Farmers ,my heart felt condolences to bereived families who sacrifice their  life  for the cause of Farmers community particularly and the Nation."
"Dear SG, your own comment proves how nuisance always gets it's demands met, and hence we should never incentivize it. You spoke of Punjab, and Sikhs, because they can create that nuisance, but you never spoke a single word about the rest of the country, the sentiments of it's people, why? Because we don't pose a threat, isn't it? However, let me remind you that the entire country stood behind GOI on it's J&K action. Do you know why? not because everybody became a BJP supporter. Not because everybody thought that the objectives and the means were all fair and blessed with the Holy Water. The entire country was with GOI because we have had enough of the nuisance, and we were fine if certain amount of unfair means had to be adopted to get rid of the nuisance."
Wht abt those farmers who died while protesting
This one single session gives more information that anyone needed. Brilliant.
Didi I need  speech on farmers  protest  for my school  compitition
"Farmer disputes (market prices, contract farming etc) matters cant taken up by the court. Only up to SDM. Seriously? So basically farmers have to rely on corrupt SDMs to solve their matters with corporations like adani & ambani."
Don't expect anything from 'tadipaar' minister 
"Bill wapis lo then all will be ok . Kisaan will happy. Its all about govt ego and Modi dictatorship . You guys are helping his Dictatorship policy. All normal people will have to pay for that INDIA is going to be China. If we didnt stop , Country is going in some rich powerful hands ."
Good. These laws would have industrialized the agriculture sector and would have helped india grow. 
You need to verify your each and every kind source you're using.
"We are farmers from Gujrat.  We was doing better with the new laws. These people did not understand the new law, so we have to go back to old times. Silly people"
If market prices crash?
This happening all over the world..
This is govt responsible because how long people  protested  .
"This is not only about farm bills now, just look how govt. is not ready to withdraw the bills when such a huge number of population is not agree with the laws. It is happening with farmers today  but in future it can also happen with other people or community. Modi sarkar is busy with events, elections and the people who elected him as PM are on roads."
"U explained very well, I think you must reveal your face. It will be so helpful to you for growing your channel.."
Mr reddy. Sure this is a democratic country. But tell us one decision of the govt since 2014 to which they have listened to the public and have acted as per public opinion. NONE.
Their no relation between government and farmers
"A very informative session.  Thank you!  I was trying to understand why is it difficult to implement  the infrastructure and system that can audit and impose the MSP at first sale of commodity from farmer to whoever (be it APMCs or Corporates). Why Government has failed here, what are the root causes for this failure? Can you please explain this for my understanding?"
"7:34 He seriously has no idea about the effect of these laws, he is just talking the language of a very much biased person."
"Gadiyan ayi kuchal ke chali gayi, 10-15 log shahid ho gye, kisan call ayi thi,,, barricade nahi they....kya bakwaas interview hai,,, he has been saying one name ,,, not able to digest this lallantop interview,,,, such a shame for opportunist"

Sahi kiya... instead of supporting this thing...all party should have come together for a talk...since supreme court ne bhi interfere kiya hai
Print needs to release these episodes in regional languages. So that masses can be enlightened.
Another clip to watch in support our Kisaan Punjab Farmers protest in London https://youtu.be/ZFCyQMbFZBc
Ek din indian army bhi kashmir se chup chaap chale jayenge
(Great work Samdish and the team!! You guys deserve likes and subscriptions)
Bhai you are really rocking
.but it's out of my understanding why Congress now saying modi govt corrupt.
Don't worry the so called farmers can still file the appeal in the court of Canada
"All Kisan is doing wrong, they must support government who is making corporate strong to fight against Pakistan and China."
Please upload questions in English also so that we can understand
"A big agitation is a head from April 22, to implement farm bills."
Congress encourages this kind of anti national politics to be in power
Respect the Private sector. Adore millionaires and billionaires. Cheer for job creators. They are creating livelihood for millions of Indians!
Farms Bills Repeal 
"its a matter of aukat, say yes to sharia law. we want sharia law. GO GO GO."
"Government should form a committe to look into farm sector who shall talk to various kisan organisation, take feedback and get them into new laws."
There's APMC ACT  ( Mandi's ) in Punjab and Haryana Given by then Central Govt after the agitation of sir chotu ram ( Kisan leader of undivided Punjab )
" When Modi was just six months old, India had hosted the first Asian Games in New Delhi and Jawaharlal Nehru introduced India's first five-year plan."
"Rakesh tikat fake   , bicholi, broker of bipakshi birodhi ... May not have ploughed and hard worked ever in the fields to generate produce low cost yeild fasal for small tenant farmers."
"These laws are taken back not because Government care for farmers....this is because upcoming elections in UP, Punjab, Uttarakhand etc...."
"Most of the farmers in India are fairly uneducated and live in poverty. The problem with bills is that while it promotes free market and opens new possibilities & options for farmers, it will encourage more and more corporates to enter in agri trade. the contract farming will be encouraged by these companies who have lawyers who will exploit the loopholes in system and put clauses and conditions in the contract to minimise the wages of farmers. Do you think a farmer will make rounds of courts when it doesn't deliver on the contract due to bad weather. Similarly stock hoarding will be a problem in future as companies will play a role in controlling prices and demand just as in stock market. Don't forget that only thing that matters for corporates is profits."
Press F to pay respect
"No, i dont agree with Abhijit. He looks immature at thought process. Its time to wait and watch. Because of his like type talk, he was arrested by odisha govt."
"You are amazing in explaining, and I love your videos and case articulations. However why were you not explicit in saying, protest is actually fuelled by Middle-men who are showing it as farmers and claiming tax benefits as Agricultural produce which runs in Lakhs of crores. Govt is trying to capture the PAN of buyer of this agricultural produce, that's why agitation is..."
Salute to everyone who gathered in support of farmers
Govt should have held the farm laws in abyence and send the laws to multi party  commission for review
" Seriously i told you, today I am regretting why I was supporting opposition party's . I am impressed  the way our PM doing hard work for our country ."
Modi government will and should be brought down
"Todayyou make me PROUD Mr. Tarek thank youmost of the time you have nothing else to talk about but India, Pakistan, Muslims, Islamand all that bullshit that we and our parents and grandparents left behind.and moved to Canada a long ago"
Our hearty  condolences for the sad tragedy...
Salute To Our Great Prime Minister Mr Shri Narendra Modi Ji   & Our Great Chief Minister Mr Shri Yogi Adityanath Maharaj Ji 
But when it comes to the optics of the situation. It doesn't look good.
Why government not set a MRP price with raw goods as there is MRP in finished goods. I think if no one can buy less than MRP then farmers will not suffer that much.
I am always with PM  Modi and Sudheer Choudhary
Indian history ka sabshe bada feku pm he .

"Farmer sows the seed. Bible is the seed God jesus sowed n satisfied our soul. C "" Bible' in google!'"
Isn't Delhi like a cluster fuck of Covid cases? Where the hell is the government? Aren't they supposed to negotiate this immediately?!
Good for them. We see the issue with large companies being in charge of farm animals here in America.
"And my tribute to those who have sacrificed their lives in this protest, jai hind."
This drama is only to come into power. But life lost by poor people will be soon forgotten. During kangress there were more bloodshed and violence. These are like vulture encircling the dead to have their pound of flesh. Hahaha But sorry to say Yogi will again take oath for second term 2022.unstoppable !
I was looking for a neutral view .but then i thought why not go with the leftist anti- nation first. 
"This decision couldn't take before,"
"Extremely unfortunate decision!  Wasn't expecting such a meek and timid surrender to anti India, anti social, disruptive rogue elements.  Now, will the govt take back CAA and Art 370, 35(A) also??  I shudder to think of such a scenario!  Shame, shame!!!"
Thanks for raising voice of farmers
Stop your whining they're just upset they can't afford to buy the kid fancy car luxury house in other country and cheat the system when they get here
Its time the protesters should use the kirpan!...
Really great explanation!
Farmers too much depends on government that is the main problem.  Give them freedom to sell their products according to their wish
I support farm laws. Anti-farm law protests are itself anti-farmer. Period.
7:18 That's true and thats the reason why farmers in bihar are in extremely poor condition.

Hats off bro. Really a  great content which even news channels needs to watch. 
Sudhir ji you explained very well but I think USA has some alliance with Taliban secretly..There is some understanding between Taliban and US otherwise it was not so easy to capture a country like this..
Newton once said : if you can't explain something to someone then it means you don't have proper knowledge about it .
Then why this government is openly dodging them. 
Why would farmers be unhappy produce is not coming to mandi? 
From last 3 months I have been trying hard to understand what the heck is this farm bill... Which has shook the nation... But now by watching your videos it is crystal clear.. Thanks a lot
Well done..keep up the good work
Arnab you never going win the hearts of people.
We lost old narendra modi . His spine has broken. At the end of the day votebank politics win . I still support farm laws. Farmers aren't only in Punjab & Haryana. Farmers from rest of the country also deserve to be wealthy.
"This all knowing foolish commentator puts on airs of a great analyst. No, he is just a busybody. Modi stuck with so many more difficult decisions, so no chickening out !"
' yeh tumhare pradesh mein chalta hoga iss desh mein nhi ' well said ....will write this in my diary. Thanks quint for sharing .
"They don't just cook for themselves, the farmers also share their food with the police. It's cold in delhi but they're willing to go through it all for their rights."
"Farmers seek getting good price whether via APMC or private company. We guess, It's always APMC makes 100% profit. Gov't is giving that freedom to farmers to sell where they get good price than congress law where farmers have to sell for less cost to tied APMC worker and middle man APMC makes money."
This the actually true reporting. Thanks the wire & team
 in Africa people are again fighting on the basis of colours and moving on roads with gun  so Stop doing this propaganda and think about your country brother 
You are very courageous Guptaji when you call your self a journalist and un-hyohenated journalism.
Brought tears to my eyes to see such a beautifully shot and edited documentary. Being away from the motherland and watching our people in despair makes my heart weep..
Congratulations  Punjabi brothers
Is it possible to implement these 3laws in such a way that those who like can opt in and those who don't like can opt out?
"Are pure india me kahi bhi jaao eisa hi milega ,its depends only person to person only."
"Please go with a team to interview actual locals. The people that came in to create 'Drama' were goons, not locals. I don't know how they got in when this very police was there. The goons pelted elderly and tried to drag people(especially turbaned individuals) to make an example out of them. In defence, some farmers/volunteers fought with the goons. SHO jumped in to stop (or save) the goon and the person fighting these goons injured SHO. The coverage on this guy is unjustified. Where the goons came from, we all know. I may like your reporting, but please fact check properly."
Up only Congress
But you did not consult farmers of Punjab. Such a mean person. You have surpassed Natwar Lal
Come to akhilesh yadav
Modi should interfere immediately. Throwing cold water on humans in a cold weather amounts to torture.
"Our farmers are facing inconvenience sitting on roads for last few months in such cold , rain with their kids  and people who are eating at their homes still criticising them, shame on such rubbish people"
Can you find any actual problem in the laws being protested against? Just read the laws and you will understand the protest for the lie it really is.
"Supporters of BJP, understand one thing - Crowd has a lot of power, it can make a chaiwala PM but it can also put effective pressure to repeal the farm laws. That's how a democracy functions. Respect crowd, Respect Democracy."
Very good decision by farmers. ...love you
"First of all the main target of my experiences is that we have no need to be fool on this univers.but sorry to say u about that we have to fight against Manuvaadi strategy .in short I have to tell you about that the real truth off my personal experience that all categories who prouds to be  Manuvaadi strategy on a limited number of people on this univers.for example RSS K pimp/Brahma Vishnu mehes, jai Shree ram,jai Mata Di extra extra.thease type of tatey we have to need to distroy immediately"

2020 farmers bill is worst
So I would request with farmers protesters to be watchful from Kejriwal. Jai jawan jai kisan. Our heartiest salutations to all farmers of the country.
"Division of society on the basis of castes, creed & religion will shatter unity of Nation.Hence such types practice should be avoided by the National leaders ."
These agriculture laws are like you say government employees to become private and change the pattern of their work.
"This is the best explanation for the so-called ""CORPORATISATION"" that the media and others were worried about. I have watched N number of discussions on this but it was never as clear to me before. Yes, the govt truly needs to keep a close watch and regulate the market accordingly."
 Just one forward Please
Comprehensive explanation and non bias.  Thank you for your hard work. Stay blessed.

"Never give up its time to fight against Modi Government & we the people of India will always support farmers , Current govt is like termites slowly eating of the nation , now at this moment ever Modi ji voice is starting to irritating me #Justice for Farmers"

Then for some time as voter you need to stay with BJP. Because he has delivered lots in 7 yrs 
You sound like a congressi apologetic right now
"its time for the real farmers  who supported the bill and come in support in large numbers, let the people see how many were against it(middlemen) and how many were in support."
I think this is not the right time  to protest. If we dont care of ones own life but respect other 's life who wish to live. By not becoming the super spreader.
Because you forgot to mention a very important point and it felt like you intentionally did it to make your Vidoe balanced instead of truthful.
Love from Bangladesh 
I think they are not real farmers they are middlemen thats why their bussinesses are finished after this law so thats why they are protesting real farmers are getting benefit of this law by that law they can sell their goods directly in market
The main question is whether BJP will get any advantage from this in coming elections. 
"Big victory of my dear farmers and family, jai jawan jai kisan jai hind "

Maybe action in PoK. Maybe UCC. If so it is a tactical retreat. Also Amarinder is certainly a factor. He could not have supported BJP without revoking the farm laws. But what is the end game. Time will tell. If there wasnt anything else then It would be a defeat for Modi.
Love from West Bengal.
What about the farmers who have given their lives (750 farmers)
Yeh to BBC ne cover kiya hai.Abhi to ANDHBHAKATO KE eyes khulni chaiya. Thanks for BBC for truth.
Other states than Punjab and Haryana have farmers too ...

Wastage of Time .I am a happy Kisan because of Modi's scemes.
I was struggling to find a sensible explanation of this burning issue and then you uploaded this video and everything explined by you is backed by logic which makes understanding really easy. I am grateful for having such a teacher as you
I also see as Govt acting tough now on agitators as farmer cause cover is removed
"interesting that everyone thinks this is the defeat of the ego......but never even once mentioned, why those laws needed to be repealed."
It's not just one state election...it's the election of Punjab. It is really really important to gain power in that state to stamp down the Khalistan movement.
Priyanka ji fit to become PM
They should have big hot air balloon hovering all over Delhi with all the writing on it.

In fact if the price goes up then farmers can again negotiate with buyer that he wish to sell as per market price and buyers has to oblige. 
It is Count down of govt
Why farmers can't go to court??
Hats off to the police department to have hailed all this irresponsible farmers.
Actually hindu sikh can stay together as brothers.. politicians are deviding us .

Our country is a mixed economy in theory and an agricultural economy in practice. 
Why you lie and you should know that because them woman come out for panjshir when Taliban catch panjshir so where was them in 20 years.
This decision will take back agricultural industry by several years again. Many states including mine and my family were keenly looking forward for full implementation of these laws. This is sad news and proves that a bunch of anti India forces can hold country to ransom with lies and pure propaganda. Shame.
Very good work by farmor for 420 congress
Great job by tikait ji and newslaundry

Why this anti farmers guys keep getting platforms on Aaj tak
"20% of opposition of farm bills won against 80% of pro-farm bills on basis of benefit of doubt. Agriculture reforms are need of an hour. Corporate seller and producing farmer nexus is important without middle men who eat up benefits drawn out of corporate seller. Well, if government took back bills in January itself, things would have been lot better keeping in view of beginning of feb delta outbreak."
"Parade will happen. It is their right. They are assuring and they have the track record of 56 days of peace. On the other hand, Govt has used force in Haryana. Farmers need to ensure that Haryana Police and CM are charged"

Wonderful but when people think that we are hiding information than they loose faith on us.
Arnabs hate against Farmer protest is so satisfying. If he is targetting someone then that means they are doing something right
@Dhruv Rathee.. i think you should post a video on current situation after government consideration and meetings with Farmers.
Pahle hospitals me lage tv me news channels chalte the aajkal music channels chalte h...
Jai kisan  this is what peaceful protest can do. Congrats to all the farmers u guys are real heroes.
If only all of them at Singhu could assure their fellow small farmers that they will stand with them if they are exploited by the private sector using these laws.

These are not farmers they are miscreants . What they did on 26 January was extreme example of that
"No USA army has not gone suddenly, it had announced long back that we are going back. "
They are very blase.about their own lives.bumpimping about on those giant tyres.
"My contention here is that Farmers are producing Wheat and Paddy because the Indian govt has incentivised only these crops. Had the govt incentivised certain other crops, farmers would have diversified too."
they killed farmers that is y farmers burnt vechiles.
Only 1 nuclear bomb all dead frm raduation haha
"Punjab, Haryana and Western UP has strong Farmers lobby.....Whenever we talk about farmer's protest its them only.....so when did you see farmer of Odisha ever protesting.....Instead of questioning the intention of farmer....ask this Autocratic government.  Please maintain your impartial Face. Dont become part of Godi Media."
"Whenever i want to know the legit details of a bill or an act without any bias, i choose this page. I mean neither quint nor republic tv  because they are all biased towards some or the other. These guys are only one i trust."
Possibly BJP has ensured a win thru this ( may have been the counter demand to fulfilling al of farmers demands)
"""If the misery of the poor be caused not by the laws of nature but by our institutions , great is our sin ! ""  "
Afghans are bound to suffer from Taliban because when they had the Afghan govt. they din't even give a single fight against Taliban for their freedom. They accept their fate and their is nothing to do about it.
You did right thing to make the video but you didn't talk about the results of these laws in bihar and Gujarat. Essential commodity act isn't described properly this law could be the real price manipulator of commodities. You unfortunately mention that govt is ready to give the farmers written assurance of msp which is not true govt is not giving the written assurance of msp. You could have talk about the news of mp where the traders cheated the farmers. And the mandi tax which you are talking about usually asked from the traders not the farmers. The quality of food is also an issue. So I must say you did a lot of research in the laws but still a lot of things missing in the video. These laws are fantastic but  for country like Australia or Canada where the farmers have big farm or lot of land not India we have former who don't have even 1 hectares of land per farmers so I don't find it too good.
we have to support our farmers
Wish this can reach more people!!
One thing more govt is making punjab down. From every side
"2adthi gst %,?charge how much"
   Taliban are enemy of India

Best analysis. All Indian citizens should watch this video even all farmers in India including people who are agitating
"I hope that punjab haryana farmers are not being selfish, bcoz if government takes back the law, they surely will benefit from that but adtiyas will start exploitation all over again."
Welcome my dear rest not untill the farm laws are withdrawn
"Actual was very different, the farmers with will power did not react with the aggressive nature they faced and stayed focused on there aims. Sorry to say your channel shouldn't do this."
I m so happy that scoop hoop and few other digital media outlets exists. I was never ashamed of anything about my country except the loons like republic tv AajTak abp India tv  zee news etc etc . I mean they are stooped down to a level where even Pakistan media feels better . They have lost the true sense of journalism. But in you guys I see the light at the end of the tunnel. This is what is called True journalism . love and respect to you guys . And your commitment shows in the fact that you stayed their up until 11:00. We can feel the dedication and hard work behind that cute laugh

"I agree on the points you made, but you should also research a little about the current procurement trends of wheat and paddy and how much of it is purchased by the govt, compare that with the production stats."
Vice should explain what the laws are instead of only showing a one sided perspective.
Can government be kind to these Farmers who are fighting for their rights?

Wonderful and informative ground reporting 
Also Abhijit ....msp is unsustainable...
From what I have heard this bills were brought by the opposition party a decade ago while the ruling government is only helping in execution. So the whole point is why are they opposing it?
This is what happens when you put unwanted policies that nobody asked for and an extremely nationalistic PM together.

"2. But if trade happens through State APMC mandis then there are various charges. For example commission agents (arhatiyas) get 2.5%, State Govt imposes mandi charges and cess which gives them Revenue BUT all these charges get built in the price and ultimately the 135 crore consumers suffer in terms of higher prices. So, if the trade move out of these APMC Mandis (till 5th June no one was allowed to trade outside APMC), then who is at LOSS???. "

Shame to see like this days may god safe us
"Farmers  ko yhi krna hota to ye phle he nhi kr diye hote . Kyou he itne din se peacefully protest krte.  Ye sb politics hai. Unko tractor rally ki permission dekar gair kisan utar kr.,apni image ac hi aur kisano ki buri  bnana chahte hai."
Election results me dikhega farmer power.
If farmers stop farming there will food emergency just like in Sri Lanka .V.Bad adminstration by BJP.

"NDTV,  yaar atleast invite a proper panelist. The very first Manjit Singh Rai is bringing shame to himself, BJP and the country. I didn't even understand what he is trying to say."
"I am an eye witness to this incident which took place at singhu Border. People who pelted stones at farmers were not local people. They were RSS people who pelted stones at farmers with support from police. I overheard few of them saying that no one will take the name of their organisation and will pretend as local people. The matter of the fact is that local people are providing basic facilities like water, sanitation etc. to protesting farmers since the beginning. A sikh farmer tried to resist the RSS people when he was dragged by Delhi police and started beating the sikh farmer mercilessly along with RSS goons. Police provided no protection to the protesting farmers and in fact gave full leverage to RSS people for pelting stones at farmers. Most of the farmers stood with joined hands requesting these goons to stop pelting of stones. But they continued to pelt stones in the presence of Delhi police. At last, the police shot tear gas not on the RSS people but on the tents of the protesting farmers. Dirty politics is being played by the goverment to defame farmer protest. I could see Sikh farmers holding Indian Flag with so much respect and dignity. Now I feel that whatever happened at Red Fort on Jan 26, it was planned by the goverment. The sikh farmer was beaten so badly that I had to close my eyes. I was neither in favour nor against the farmer protest, but after witnessing this incident with my own eyes, I have my full support and solidarity for these innocent farmers. I salute to their patience."
Best of all. I was just hypnotised after listening to Abhi Daa.  We need content like this.
Someone in BJP even mentioned  14 percent can't do anything what will 2 percent will do that's what's wrong and inciting Punjabi farmers and compared it to shaheen bag well thats the result now history will remember this.
"Nothing but fooling the nation.    Everybody is only trying to prove to which gang or which party the criminals were, rather than immediately finding the truth and punishing the criminals.   Considering the anti-farmer attitude that the new urban and social media India has, these incidents happening is not surprising.    Not sure whether the Modi and Yogi brigade considers this as a great achievement of developing UP."
"thanks for the initiative, this really helpful.."
"We are farmers, with full confidence, which strong wills,and,will, struggle,unto, last breath.( Jammu and Kashmir, Kisan and fruit growers wellfare federation)"
"There are far too many problems the farmers are facing. Unfortunately for the policy making body this knowledge is not available. Hence even though sincere effort is being made by the Government, doubling of income would be only a dream . What is required at present is identifying all factors affecting his income; look for solutions to each one to overcome the same. If not possible what else can be done??? You need a systematic approach to solve the problem??? In my opinion we have not done the homework to solve the problem???. We are all living in fools paradise  Ultimate sufferer is the farmer?? His woes we have no knowledge "
Modi track record  is better in all aspect  from previous  ..

"This the BJP real colour. BJP and Modi wants to ear huge profits by their supporters corporate companies like Adani, Ambani and etc. Example Apples for Rs. 12/- per kg from the farmers and companies given free hand by the BJP to sell to citizens for minimum price of Rs. 200/- maximum to extend for their huge profits to give the party fund to the pet political party. This present BJP, Ambani and Adani modern India. Citizens blood is squeezed by the BJP government."

Tmlog budget analysis ker rehi ho ya  election ka parchar
Kudos the person who was narrating the reality of the bill at background
"Let farmers decide whats best for them. We are talking about 500 farmers association with lakhs of members. They know each and every alphabet in the bill. Farmers are telling all three bills are tailor made for the corporates. They have all the resources and advocates to understand this bill. The association even said it cannot be made by government because it is so micro detail that farmers will be blocked from all 4 corners. Farmers association already had 5 meeting . 2 in Punjab and 3 in Delhi but still they are adamant about not applying it. The only thing they want from the government is to loose all this 3 bills and apply MSP. Even U.K. government said this is a death bill for the farmers. 36 ministers from U.K. has sent letter to modi not to apply this bill. This bill has already been applied in western countries and it flopped big time. It only looks ok on theory but not in practice. Bottom line is this bill was not put into place with good intention, government knew its cons. Gov thought farmers are stupid and brought this kala bill swiftly during corona crisis on June 2020."

Something similar happened to me when you want to give benefit to have nots. I as a lecturer started evaluating practicals after every practical. Surprisingly students at the bottom of the ladder started getting more marks than the top segment. The top segment considered it as birth right to get 90-95% marks irrespective of their performance. The top segment engineered a strike against me that I am no good teacher. Something similar again happened with me many years later. But this time I became person non grata of the topper of the class as he got C grade due to his non performance in submissions. And many more instances.
None of the other crops other than rice and wheat are the farmers ever able to get MSP on. You can dig out and see thousand of cases by the farmers from Punjab on this...I come from a farmers family and whenever we diversify on average there is always a loss. Last year my uncle produced black dal and had to travel a 100km to sell it for just rs15 per kg when consumer get it for 10 times the price. We have tried so many pulses and had to sell them on dirt cheap prices as we don't have storage and the traders are able strong arm the farmers.
Why doesn't  the Indian govt give the farmers  what they want.if the farmers  feel insecure and threatened then the govt should listen to the farmers.
Some Farmers are unable to understand the vision of PM Modi. He always looks beyond 20 years and does things. It's unfortunate that farming sector won't be able to move forward.

"Common man point: if these bills will be implemented , then any registered company can buy and stock crop in unlimited quantity and store it till prices touch the sky, so black market will emerge and wheat which is around Rs.1800 per quintal will be more than this, no control will be  of government on it , so common man have to pay high for food(wheat,rice, vegitable,fruits etc etc)"

"Dhruv brother you are unaware of true facts. Initially all farmer union leaders decided to perform tractor parade on ring road but later due to unkown reasons they changed their decision on midnight of 25th january to march on route given by delhi police. This created confusion and anger among all protestors. Therefore people decided to march on initial route against the permission of delhi police. From this you can understand that deep sidhu and lakha sidhana weren't responsible for any action but the union leaders are truly responsible. Coming towards the red fort topic, is it an offense to raise farmer's flag and nishan sahib on empty pole where there was no tricolor at all? Is it legal in our constitution for RSS to raise their flag on red fort? Rules must be same for everyone. Moreover if you say that red fort is highly prestigious and respected site of india then is it okay for our PM to sell this public property to dalmia bharat group for span of 5 years in exchange of money? Mr Rathee, you can't prove farmers guilty and justify others without stating true facts. Now when you decide to make video on something , please be aware of each and every fact and must provide the every side of story."
Thank you VOX for such a easy tutorial for world audience. Farmers are being cheated in a democratic country so openly and whoever talks about it is blamed as anti national. 200 people lost their lives so far in this protest but still not a single word or a tweet for them from the head of the state. Which can give you a glimpse that how much Indian government is serious about these protests .
"This is only a partial information what you have provided with your expert ,I wish to know how much wheat or rice is being produced annually in India and the farmers who lend their land for these products, what do they charge annually & why they are producing these two products only. If government has come out with one market one nation ,there is a big purpose behind it , which you must learn before showing your intelligence. Even your expert has no knowledge of actual problem which hit's not our earning only but also hampers the progress of country. All governments tried in their periods to bring these law's but we're not in majority to do it. I further add government is not averse to Mandi's & has further earmarked huge funds to modernise these Mandi's & to increase in number where ever it's needed .Now  All other bullshits that corporates will dominate in pricing or will take the land of small farmers, in that regard it's impertinent to mention , contact will be of crop & leasing out land, that's a separate act for that purpose so fear at all of losing land. Now main problem of Government is of buffer crops of both items of wheat & rice produced in India which unmanageable by government & it's agencies that's why I asked to tell me how much of both have been produced in gone year of 2020. To your surprise it was 10,718 lakhs quintials of wheat & 11,417 lakhs quintals of rice , what's the storage capacity required to be for keeping such huge quantity of both. People & opposition parties even told many lies to public about the storage that was got constructed by FCI from Adani Group in late 1990s & 2000to 2010. Even All these storage capacity are negligible in face of what is being produced of both these crops . It's for farmers to produce & sell both commodities but huge difficult for government to carry such stocks for number years where as it's shelf life is few months only & may be extended to a year or so with pesticides & fumigation . Production of wheat is nearly 400% more of what India needs annually & production of rice is more than 200% of need of India & government wishes to change the crop mix only & that will have to be done for the benefits of people of India. We only important adible oil's & further more it can be changed to cash crops which Punjab & Haryana have left in past about 30 year's.If you have any talent now suggest remedy of it rather than misguiding the people without much knowledge of true problem."
They both have taken a great initiative which everyone won't. They have the guts to speak the harsh truth be it against any law or political party so we must also understand our responsibility now 
I think this is the biggest reward of a journalist.. Kisan bhai k saath even I salute you and your journalism   
"Why the hell, this video is so underrated, it should be viral at the time of farmer protest!"
Most of urban youth is still unaware about the issue #supportfarmers
"Sorry for asking, but wouldn't this situation be resolved if the government just introduced new minimum price laws for the produce of the farmers and enforce them? That way the three farm laws would be acceptable, the system would rid off middlemen and both the farmers and the government would get what they want. Again, apologies for my naivete regarding the issue, just wanting to understand the situation better."

"Farm Laws were much needed and long overdue, sadly cud not not be implemented. Anyway good that they have been repealed to break the deadlock. The movement had become highly politicised and hijacked by leftist forces with security of the country at high risk. No need to feel dejected. Modi govt shud get busy in detailed conversation n consultations with all stake holders like farmers, Opposition, agriculture economists, ahratyias to come up with revised n more acceptable form of Farm Laws within next 20 months... Use Amarinder Singh and SAD services. Keep congress on board."

Thank you for covering the Farmer Protest. It matters a lot. Thank you 
Why are people not supporting farmers like they supported SSR's case? 
We want another ghodra in Gujarat 
let me share my point of view. To prove that these bills are in favour of corporates
Good for rich farmers and APMC agents
These countries can easily give few billion dollars to Afghanistan every month.

"Most of the leaders fear of modi., Due to his straight"
Even protest going on it is safest place where no one get affected by corona. No one using mask
"Those who're supporting this, may this happen to you."
"At the end of the video, one of the panel experts recommended organic farming which has been covered and debated extensively about...The conclusion is it is unproven, snob-ish, won't help at all at increasing yields if not make it even worse...So the govt should NOT at any cost incentivize that...We should instead focus on tech that regulates and directs an ample amount of nutrition directly at the grassroots of the crops so that we minimize exploitation and save money for both govt and farmers"
"UN me bolenge hum mother of democracy  hain, ye kaun sa democracy hai pm Sahab"
"Very informative, yes our government was wrong"
Farmers - MSP can't by guaranteed. Guaranteeing MSP means the money goes from taxpayers or Corporates pockets without any quality evaluation. A MSP range per year can be proposed based on estimated demand by Govt. (Govt.and Corporate can use data analytics and set MSP range based on historical and projected demands and make the process transparent and visible) but Kisan cannot go to court when MSP is not within the range. And no guarantee. Nobody knows accurate regional demand in advance.
Our government is still not doing any and the protest is still going on.

A serious wrong decision...but modi has to do it for elections
I think BJP learned few things from this and hopefully they can  do a better job in the future
"Sir, the best scenario is more govt.mandies closer to the farmers & guaranteed MSP  & a guaranteed procurement of atleast the 23 farm produce which is already there on paper. This not only is reassuring to the farmers but at the same it generates more employment opportunity due to more mandies. The govt.can use part of the produce to distribute to PDS (ration shops) to meet the govt's social obligation which also the govt.can use it as assured vote bank of the poor. The balance of farm produce procured & stored may be sold to Pvt.players  at higher rates for them to add value & sell at good profits. This will be a win-win for all stake holders."
They still have not been able to arrest the alleged actor Deep Sidhu. 
Can u explain about the cast system in india in brief ??
Our great PM is looking after the farmers for their welfare...but would request the PM to look after the senior citizens too..since long they r requesting the HM n PM to increase the EPFO pension for the senior citizens too so that they could also spend the rest of their life peacfully....pls forward this request..

Some videos are related to Congress party they chanting Congress party Rahul Gandhi it means this video is not related to this spot and this murder   this channel is misleading completely
Brilliant explanation. Why our MPs of ruling party are not able to explain lucidly like. Dr Manish Kumarji's in the Parliament is a matter of concern and should be explained accordingly.
You tried to explain but many points missing because you didn't have number about side effects of collapse of APMC.

"The new farm laws will not only affect the farmers but also us, the citizens who rely on the farm products directly or indirectly. Changes to uplift the agriculture and farmers lifestyle is definitely required. But it must also involve understanding their issues at the ground level and working on the solutions around it. A small inconvenience in our life to uplift our farmers lives is the least we could take."
They are bunch of criminals who are fighting for power in the mane of farmers
    + yes absolutely entrepreneurship shud be encouraged and cultivated that is what acharya ranga agri university is doing which in turn run by govt to develop sonamasuri that is more efficient than japans one and organic farming is encourage by govt R&D unlike cruel private companies harmful chemical fertilizers which destroys soil fertility in long term
Outdated MSP system. Must be changed. Destruction of income and destruction of environment.

Shame on that people who dont support farmers
So far 150 farmers died during protest by severe cold and still the dictator is being indifferent about it
The U.S. can always fight from outside the country.
The government needs to watch this so that they can educate themselves.
Ridiculous shame on protesters ....
India knows very well  how to deal with them.
Never expected this back step from this government
Thank you mr mod 
 Please know that only Adani Group and Ambani are vacating all the departments.
This policy is part of the WEF reset. The goal is to remove ownership of land from the farmers by forcing prices down for the crop. Well done to them for their hard resilient attitude.
That damn smile of ADM Ayush Sinha
Thanks for support Ajit Anjum ji  aap hamesha dillon me rahogey 
"Actually the three farm laws were good for the marginal farmers who are in majority.. Although, I cannot challenge Government's move but the three farm laws shouldn't have been taken back.. Punjab and Haryana constitute just 4% of India's population."

Any bill is passing in the houses it should be published before approval of the houses. So that every common man can understand the developments and problems may face in future to tell houses to make reforms correctly.

"Yet, remarkably, both belong to the same India when it comes to households that have electricity and drinking water (between 95 per cent and 100 per cent). And when it comes to women with bank accounts, the gap is smaller than for some other metrics (92 per cent in Tamil Nadu, 77 per cent in Bihar). One would expect that, progressively, we will see more of the India that Tamil Nadu represents. But given the different fertility ratios, we will have many more Indians whose lived reality is Bihar."
This practice of using water cannons and tear gas must be stopped at all costs.
