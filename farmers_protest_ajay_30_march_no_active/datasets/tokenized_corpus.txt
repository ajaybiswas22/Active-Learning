in over 20 day more than 22 farmer have die the priority should be to diffuse the situation one solution be to enact new law incorporate the substantive demand of the farmer which government have virtually agree to and also incorporate a repeal clause in it annul the three exist reform law the new enactment and annulment shall happen at the same time thus meet the demand of the farmer and government retain it seemingly fragile and recalcitrant prestige
question 1 for the first law the business owner can be private company as well a exist mandis right if the farmer doesnt trust a private company dnt they have a choice to continue their business with the mandis another question 2 when farmer get into a contract with a private company r they not go to hire a lawyer to work out the detail of the contract to protect themselves also 3 cant this law to modify further to add more protection for the farmer rather than ask complete repeal

bro in my opinion the government the party be always plays dirty politics they can do anything for the power but politics on our national flag police force be not acceptable i do not know how they farmer come inside the red fort but that be not easy to go inside in red fort so i think very dirty politics have be play and for farmer the protest do by them be only acceptable when it be in a peaceful manner violence be not accept and on the national flag never that be not easy to influence anybody i know that violence will be do one day but i do not expect in this way and about who do the mistake i think it be a mistake from both side no one be innocent the farmer as well a all party be guilty behind this and who be defend them farmer and all party i do not expect that also i be worried about my future and our future a i be only 16 year old i can not live in this kind of environment which be go more and more destructive day to day and i be not worry about the nation the world the nature i be worry only about the thinking of the people around all our the world if i say something wrong please forgive me
these bill only support big corporate
i think farm law be a way to empower farmer the law may not be perfect a of now but at least their be an initiative presence of government agent middleman have dwindle the ability of the farmer to grow from a labor to businessman some may be exploit but that will thrive them to grow people in india want to have the same lifestyle and income a rich develop country like u canada but they do not want to work for it they want it be hand to u by the government for no extra effort or cost people need to grow out their mindset best form of governance be self governance

lastly i m no bjp supporter i m from bengal and the aware people would know well what it mean for bjp and it be support base
but more 90 of farmer have nothing to do with these law it medium that have hype them and agitation against them we in the west south be take advantage of many newly introduce facility for farmer book rail wagon to send farm produce to far away place use digitally connect market to get good rate than local mandis or sell directly to online retailer like jiomart bigbasket etc more and more farmer be take to organic and zero budget farm these law do not matter to u either way
ajit ji you be truly a great journalist who have be select for a such reward by the public it be more than a prejudiced bharatratna let see the godi medium
india democratic country hai bill pas karna hai to sahi se karo
minority right be be big problem in india the muslim sikhs have to live accord to law that what a secular country do but i do not think so bjp gov be good with that i m not look any future of bjp in coming time modi be last tenure bring india to verge of lose their land

it be not controversial they be very good law now these uneducated farmer will bring the indian economy down ffs
the farmer anger be understood but the same farmer be try to pretend that they be efficient producer
stringent action should be take against miscreant artis and agent they be not hard work farmer
rich farmer of 2 3 state win the game bad part be even congress and many farmer oppose it even though these law be first propose by congress by the support of farmer at that time
well explain sir i be a farmer be son and i really appreciate you speak for farmer
about contract farm the set up be quite similar to future market in finance fix the price in the contract before farm a solution to avoid counterparty risk in these farm contract could be to set up an exchange it may not be feasible immediately but can be ponder on for long term benefit in order to increase transparency in future
thanks for the video just one quesiton to the people oppose this bill if farmer wont get a msp from a private company why cant he go back and sell in apmg mandi a usual where he get the msp these be newly add law but be not replace any current law

govt want to stop the suicidals and poor living condition of farmer govt will not stop any subsidy or procurement through fci nor ration system and all 138 crore people can not depend on ambanis mall for buy rice and foodgrains do you think ambani adani have mall in all over india
the bill be past in the parilment the farm law have to repeal should be do in the parilment not merely announce
the paid khalistanis which be the supporter of congress party and the leftist
era of modi humiliation every where within india against neighbour even with so call friendly government like americs iran and afghanistan
these farmer need to move on to a more sustainable business model right now they be live on charity through indirect subsidy like msp and free electricity be the indian farmer not capable of live without charity

this be a great victory for our farmer against the government feel like we have win against dictatorship
shameless modi india have never have such a shameless pm in history he be ruin india
many farmer in my village be unhappy with the repeal but i think they deserve to not deserve these law
whether the government have take into account the livelihood dependant on agriculture other than farmer while stick to pass the bill i doubt the farmer will be benefit whatsoever rather the attitude show in the floor of rajyasabha seem beneficiary be some else in the long run entire agriculture will be monopolize by the business tycoon a it be see in europe america canada n so on
im against this law a it exploit the farmer the contract farming be something farmer fear a it give open permission to udyogpatis to exploit farmer and remove msp will bring our farmer below poverty line which could be disastrous and can lead to famine and depletion of economic liberalism and turn indian economy into capitalist economy whic can be pretty fatal for our country jai kisan kisan ekta zindabad
godi medium learn a lesson how to earn respect like ajit anjum ndtv navin kumar reporting

max price by private company price in apmc price in apmc
you do tell u how farmer be affect by the apmc act very nice yeh to sabhko pata chal gaya hai
it seem the consumer be the one who would be affect more than the farmer besides some sort of safety be be to provide to the farmer which bring them to the positive side
if any trader give a price high than msp in mandi then it will be minimum price right
let see if godi medium will hold debate on this or not or even air this video on their channel
do the pakistani iss regret support the taliban now will afghanistan annex waziristan
4 they think they be weaker in negotiation position if that be the case then why can not they do collective selling so that many farmer will negotiate and sell it then they will have a high hand they themselves will come for sell in any area
since agriculture be a state subject state should have be take into confidence centre have encroach state be jurisdiction though at present msp be be continue there be a scope for it be end which endanger farmer interest though the objective of the bill be say to be elimination of middleman namaste indeed small middleman would be replace with huge corporate house which mean centralization scope to form syndicate and dictate term meanwhile large number of so call middleman render jobless and thrown into poverty i e amass wealth by a few individual repeal essential service commodity act or remove food grain be a great harm to public it give trader huge scope to create artificial scarcity and hoard fleece public money i m sight horrible future and terrible exploitation
farmer be clearly well informed look at the discussion the police wala do not know a thing
wow thrill to see this kind of coverage of tractor parade thanks to harp farmer picture why dont modi medium show this
unfortunately debt will have to be pay by small farmer which would have get the most advantage from three farm law
sir iam fan of your lecture but i do not agree with the minimum support price which be give by indian government basically farm sector be the most hard one compare to any other sector but the amount they get from it be very less or camparitavily loss due to this situation many farmer do suicide because of loss iam not against indian government but when ever we take private people in any sector they will think about profit so here government should strictly give guidance for price in the same way we should reduce the paddy grow cost by encourage machine in agriculture sector by give subsidy for farmer i be agree government be give subsidy but it be not reach the poor farmer it be distribute among rich landlord farmer by use their political influence in my point government should encourage to reduce the cultivation capital and give proper guidance for minimum support price properly in ground level because people have no option that why your not buy my paddy a government market because we have right to question the government but here private people mainly concentrate on profit government should take proper measure to overcome it
you do not know how on the name of farmer people be work a a protest more than 50 percent in the protest they be broker which take farmer money and for that government have pass the law by which all the broker will lose their money and all the money will go too farmer pocket
farmer turn violent rab kare anchor te rabb same situation paye
thanks to bjp all indian be unite against these evil devil

let have another agriculture revolution for our farmer kisaan ekta zindabaad
this be why modi be in power he will next election too
1 farmer produce trade and commerce act

stand with farmer
never hurt farmer their need come
it tragedy for small farmer
this mainly give profit to private company or government but it minimize the profit of farmer
however he could not do anything by stay in congress he therefore leave the congress and decide to go with modi shah sad also promise support to any move in the national interest but it be against farm law for reason best know to them
stand out of herd behaviour and try to understand law logically that only aim to eliminate middleman who take away 40 t0 60pc farmer price wealth
production cost increase five time if modi ji ask farmer income increase five time
feel very proud for my farmer
this be where our india lead to shame on you indian govt how mercelessly indian army be deal with indian farmer
it be all plan from day one canadian khalistanis fund these people and used farmer protest the protest itself be pointless why protest against something that your own farmer in majority ask for do the farmer no ask for private firm to buy their produce so they can get most of the money instead of government
prepration of up and punjab election
in case these bill be for the betterment of farners then there should have be improvement in apmc s and law on msp instead adani agro ltd have develop 1000 s of acre cold storage and silo in the past 3 year wherein there be no mention if these bill
this bill could be the progressive medium for development of farmer but if we focus loop hole and do some amendment we it could work even well do not just look it a a political agenda government should unite the farmer oppose just because of political support be not good something be practically difficult to apply but alteration could help to improve
whole nation be with you farmer for do not implement 3 new rule

11 one specific political party which never even support our armed form with good weapon be high on support rowdy farmer our iaf be still fly 40 year old plane when 15 year old scooter be scrap

well government must ensure the corruption free farmer system and look at the current agriculture situation all three law be indeed necessary to bring revolution in farming and make farmer well connect to the business world so that they can increase their income but all i can see these so call farmer agitation be in reality be political move or we can say it anti modi agitation nothing else

state like bihar do not have mandi system they have private sector who never give them appropriate price of there crop bihar already have private sector for buy the crop from farmer from past 10 year than also bihar farmer be poor in the country with 5000 monthly income where a state like haryana who have govt mandis farmer income be 14 000 per month so bringing private sector in agriculture be surely not a solution of this problem problem be to remove middle man or make a law for compulsury to follow by all the state and increase wearhouse system where govt can store good amount of food to sell other country india be on no 1 to sell food in international market than also indian farmer be poor be the world
this be not do i m very disappointed by modi ji what the benefit of have 300 seat and still you can not implement the bill on ground this set a example of any group people can come together and oppose any bill block road and pressurise government to revoke that bill so what the benefit of have power be those bill be wrong than why early you support those bill and argue on very stage i do not think there be any benefit of have a majority government anymore
see farmer be misinform about msp the law dont have anything to do with msp itself and govt have assure that also the apmc with thier msp will not go even after 100 year if the apmc act be undisturbed it actually farmer choice that they want to sell in mandi or to private sector so punjabs farmer should continue to sell in mandi and dont sell in private sector
i don t know why govt do not give it ensurance to poor farmer regard msp
in short this bill be very good for farmer thanks

india be a very complex system where the middle class enjoy cheap food price and farmer receive low price for their crop a they currently be not allow to store crop pay high price for input and do not have the ability to protect themselves with future contract the current system in india be not sufficient to support all the small farmer in india they lack the scale to produce store and market their own product a free market can only work which these bill seek to do if both buyer and seller have equal bargaining power small farmer be not only lack the skill but also the knowledge to effective participate in a free market they free they will be crush under low price the government should offer assistance and compensate for farmer harm by these law until the economy normalized india need to grow beyond have million of small farmer and the farmer need to accept their faith but i think the government do not do a good job in market these bill also the people of punjab be well off farmer compare to rest of india if you look at the number of child be send outside from punjab to study in college you would understand why punjabi be at the heart of the protest they enjoy the high income in the country from farm any threat to their lifestyle would bring about a reaction many of those protest have on name brand clothes nike adidas and drive audis these be not the lowly farmer of bihar

i tolly agree with this video but resons behind why farmer be protest in my opinion be this that a particular farmer in haryana and punjab mostly grow wheat and rice mainly small farmer and when they have to sell their product they will get less price and when they have to buy other product like pulse grams patotes etc they have to pay more a say in the video prises will get increase and
they never do farm nor work in farm but earn more money than actual farmer
farmer law be all good i think government should not take them back they make a mistake
hat off to the farmer

your title of this vedio be incorrect and be antifarmers when i know you be not so fix the title
4 one could technically argue that bring in free market would mean fair pricing no middle men and also the money get pass on directly to farmer without have to pay income tax farmer still get an msp if they want to go to apmc but more and more they would prefer not to if they get preferential pricing by private company outside

this fool have no solution but only crib in contrast please all listen to prof gulati this man have nothing to offer to the farmer
why general public be be harass by these farmer business trader be industry have already suffer too much from the blockage of road patient have suffer from these blockage of road

under the new bill the contract farming approach do not guarantee msp it be suggest that be one of the fundamental demand from the farmer several political leader example haryana cm be mislead the people if the govt really want to help the farmer they should work with farmer organization to improve the exist apmc system they should see the swaminathan commission report for recommendation official study do by govt 2004 2006
farmer from punjab can not do not represent farmer of whole country
thats why farmer should start cooperative base agricultural sector to save there life

same happen with moong urad cotton and other crop the only we a farmer want be to be able to sell our crop atleast on msp modi govt be bill only need to add this one clause that if anyone buy from farmer below msp there will be severe consequence so that it can ensure that a farmer life be not leave at the plight of corporation
other news farmer be terrorist talwa chat rahe sarkar ke

farmer need to accept the fact that privatisation be the only thing which can make farmer prosper in the long run how inefficient the bureaucracy be can be see from the fact that since past 50 year just farm have not lead to anh good for the farmer
imagine farmer protest get join by ordinance factory worker and caa protestors back by shivsena and congress modi shah will have no escape
i be very satisfied with your video on the topic but you have ask the question that why do police need to use tear gas so it be very clear that police can do lathi charge if protestors get violent but they do not do that and we know that violent protestors attack cop and how the police be pull back and injure so what be leave with the police be police be there for just beat up by the protestors a not a single farmer be injure by police hence they have to use tear gas to control the mob when they be try to pull down the bus to clear the road and if there be a confusion with the route then it be the responsibility of the leader although if farmer be confuse then in confusion they start attack police and start move to close route and start break barrier i don t think anyone can do that in confusion
please at least now stop address them a farmer
i come from an india where newslaundry be an independent medium

2 contract farming be possible without any act then why to bring this new regulatory act which look more beneficial to the affluent contract farmer farming company

do not take away the innocence of the child personally feel bad when i see a child be front for a political objective i wish all involve a speedy resolution in the interest of both the farmer and the country
the government usually force the farmer to sell locally at low price so that they can supply subsidized rice to urban consumer or to keep the rice price low in city
look the looter threten to rise khalistan movement of they be not let to loot they have already show their international might even by make canada president talk for them oganising event in many place in the world how these middleman exploit punjabi sentiment for their selfish purpose
it be strange situation that the law farmer want be be deny and the law they do not want be be implement
they be ask for msp minimum support price
there appear no use of discussion at the time of promulgation and no use at the time of repeal everything be decide by majority which be ensure after election result declaration and govt formation the whole process be thus democratic people be say

how all the member can support a repeal of the law which in truth would help the farmer and the country
firstly they request and demand these farm law be to be repeal
who have come here to support farmer
people say modi only repeal them because he want the vote in the upcoming election but be not this what democracy be all about it be because india have democracy that modi be force to listen to the farmer voice and repeal these law be india a more authoritarian country these farmer would be crush and the head of state would cling on to power a usual

this govt will block road path pass way for delhites to win cheap publicity fie on this govt to provoke and instigate farmer against the delhi public chaddi baaz fie on them
i too dontt support these farm law but there should also be a solution for avoid farmer repeatedly harvest wheat and paddy due to msp and lead to ground water depletion also subsidy if possible should be channel to small land own farmer rather than be a generalise one
modi nothing do for farmer so far
why be no one ask eyewitness that why they saw tamasha of kill reporter and bjp volunteer do nothing to help or themselves indulge in beat them to death like most farmer a see in the video and question of wear bhindravale shirt
win of democracy farmer tell u the power of right to protest dhikkaar hai un logo ko jo abhi bhi kisano ko anti national bol rahe hai agar farm bill ache hote to farmer protest nhi karte

i feel these law will be back this look to be a tactical withdrawal i support the farm law and be disappoint when they be withdraw however i m very very hearten that modi take back the law even at the cost of his reputation that tell me that he be not drink his own ego you need to really be concern about a leader who be inflexible because of his image and ego that to me further strengthens my belief in bjp and modi
1 small farmer of punjab and haryana and farmer of all other state be not protest
this good video seem to be slight tilt towards right wing to me it be laughable to hear any political motif from other party to bjp bjp have be ruthless handle opposition my guess be people farmer be oppose farm law since they do not have trust on private sector and weakening of govt market and msp will hurt them
we a indian without a doubt should support our beloved farmer and hope the government and farmer find a solution

in agriculture no farmer want to have low quality because quality be directly proportional to quantity
kill 4 bjp leader and driver burn thier vehicle by farmer be unacceptable those who be conspirator must be punish
ultimately more more farming population would be require to move to white blue collar job but first provide these job be create by incentivising make in india industry education health manufacturing industry and give a level playing field to state like punjab which be border state while the state alongside it be give incentive for the industry to set up by the centre give them tax holiday whereas industry be heavily tax here

thank you bro to get me a brief knowledge about farmer be law
the bill have support from majority of the farmer from other part of the country this be a fact also the subsidy enjoy by punjab and haryana actually be rob the subsidy of farmer from other region this must stop in the garb of msp the farmer of these two state dump their substandard produce to mandis basmati rice they never sell in mandis they be already sell high cost rice like basmati directly to corporates the rice and wheat that we get from pds ration shop be actually be the grain that govt be force to buy even though the supply be more than demand try eat the rice and wheat from ration shop then you will know what i be talk about currently since there be guarantee msp they produce quantity but not quality and dump those to mandis i want to support genuine farmer but surely would not support who be just behind money and do not care anything about quality currently this be the case of farmer from punjab and haryana
this be the true face of modi be rss india shame on this police wala

farmer be right here
a per i heard farmer be fear that if they can sell in any part of the country their own mandis might get weaken because that be the only hope of sell their product if the fci do not accept all food actual case so that will ultimately lead them to do contract farm which will be just for the sake of a company and that they will have to sell their product anywhere at low cost to them if mandis become non existent and will ultimately be like a jio v s airtel battle i feel their pain but no government give respect to any farmer be it congress or bjp all be just a bunch of evil rule the country

main reason for protest imho be the way the bill ordinance law be push through the close analogy i can think of be if someone barge into a house with a suitcase that he claim be goody for the occupant any occupant would ask him to take his goody and get out if the intruder say i will not open the suitcase but leave it her unopened for 18 month the occupant would still say get out how many of u have have the experience where someone barge be without knock maybe with something official or legal we would insist the person get out knock and walk in only after you give permission in such circumstance if it true nothing else but repeal the law will work and the long the inevitable be prolong the more the risk of something flare up and thing go beyond everybody be control and also the more it be prolong it only make the opposition stronger

i think the quick and potentially a winning gambit for modi govt would be to declare that the farm law would not be comp lsorily thrust on state it would be upto the state to take a decision on their implementation thereby not only shift the focus away from the central govt but also pave the way for some state to lead the way by implement the law and reap the benefit leave the others behind force the latter to mend their way when the entire farm protest be lead by a narrow fringe belonging to only 2 state such an outcome could easily be envisage

lol good work in make the video guess there certain point in the bill which definitely need amendment match with the point raise by it make thing a bit more clear why it need amendment there must be some msp a a legal right whenever they be open up market it be a very valid point to stop corporate monopoly how much that msp must be be debatable it can be low than current msp but there must be a legal implement msp otherwise there can definitely be a monopoly be always a supporter for this govt but in this case it need to act quickly and resolve the matter soon instead of any delay result in loss for vote
other than haryana punjab kissan why not other state kissan protest

love to all farmer from pakistan
in my city every wednesday the farmer directly sell their product at a comparatively low price perhaps if the bill be successfully implement there be a fair possibility that the uniformity in the price of the commodity will be hamper ofcourse the consumer will go for the low price and this will probably add to the fury of the middleman if at all involve
do not expect u people will come in his place that be modi do any p m till today get the respect like our p m modi ji do not think b j p will loose they will win with more number of seat priyanka gandhi do not expect ur family will again take india again in ur hand

hahahahaah we wonder how india america and nato fail in afghanistan and now blame pakistan be weird what be they do there that they can not even control the area with that might india should send force in afghanistan because it be a regional military might qnd teach lesson to pakistan

i usually do not dislike ndtv be videos but the title be just show they be somewhat biased if bjp minister do something bad they clearly write bjp minister but when congress minister relative be involve they just write minister just to be clear i do not like bjp it be just a thing i notice
i be so surprised that you be talk about lend money by these middleman artis on personal basis there be no legal framework to support the farmer and in fact you could task corporation to support a minimum viable price and not extort the farmer you be speak one side though i understand market pressure will come in to force and drive price base on demand and supply but this do not mean msp and mandi be viable option imagine this kind of price control exist in other commodity it do not support the economics or farmer the developed nation dont have this system and do away with it and indian farmer receive a lot of perk those have vested interest support it out of greed hope the farmer understand the long term benefit concern can be address when corporation invest in the sector and contract could be mutually inclusive
create a doubt in people be mind about farmer be protest
farmer proud of you at least some one have gut to fight against dictator gunda modi and bjp we support farmer

i m from pakistan but i support your content because you be talk about the right of people
regard the farm produce it will definitely follow commodity cycle of wild upswings and downswing we can see how much the price of onion fluctuate every single year in fact many customer like my mother use it to their benefit by build up inventory at low price naive farmer will sadly suffer whether at the hand of corporate or middleman politician a usual will act for their own benefit
modi should resign for not repeal the 3 black law in time what a shameful coincidence or be it political engineering a the black law be repeal a the sikh celebrate the birth of guru nanak devji the founder of sikhism sweet venom
when there be not any other agenda for politics leave now the bjp member be use the agenda of taliban at least this agenda will work for some time
to bring any reform in india a process of educate the farmer be paramount i do believe that mr modi always think in favour of the mass and in this case how to make farming very competitive with big return there be no doubt reform in farming be need to take india to new level however the farmer main concern be that the measure of reform would benefit corporates and the corporates would dictate their term to the farmer this aspect make them extremely uncomfortable
sir i really like your argument very well articulate the financial and economical side of these bill seem good but first actually produce different crop and diversify the production be not easy it be expensive which be why have msp provide assurance to farmer a they dont get pay every month like everyone who work in some kind of professional field the bill be not bad but shouldnt govt build the infrastructure first that will provide the farmer with assurance like increase price of other crop and guarantee minimum support price

you miss a large point which make the govt sit think over at the recent inauguration of the expressway by pm a lot of up bus be deploy to bring people from village to show pm be still popular but all those bus return to the inaugural site practically empty pm show be damp squib this be also one of the reason to trigger withdrawal of farm law govt know it take panga with wrong people sikhs maybe minority but they be resilient warrior who can show people their place govt know even after doctor opinion poll to show bjp govt be still popular contrary to ground reality it be likely to lose up election

now how this so called farmer netta ask modi to double the farmer income
sorry not protest farmer correct be protest sikh
accord to my knowledge similar concept be present in u where farmer can sell there production to any one but it fail because business men be naturally profit maker and the reason farmer be survive there be the incentive they get from the government to continue agriculture a you know the farmer there be much more educated than the indian counterpart and the fact that they be still be exploit justifies the fear of indian farmer
jai jawan jai kisan modi ki tapasya ka formula water cannon wire barricade stop water supply false case call farmer a terrorist agent of china pakistan etc if this be formula of tapasya then guess the mindset of the nikamma leader

7 30 poor small farmer have to borrow money average land hold in punjab be 3 62 hectare compare to 1 08 hectare nationally three time the national average yes poor small farmer indeed the system must be improve for farmer to realize more financial gain your argument should be access of good fund and credit to farmer the arhtiya be not the only way to do that and that be not a good enough reason to keep them around
why be people say that these reform be pass without any consultation these farm bill be pending since the upa government in 2013
shekhar sir with all respect to your way of journalism i think you be clearly miss the large picture it not about the fact that msp will remain or not or whether the exist system have lot of flaw which everyone know yes it have i think it more about securitising the poor farmer of our country agriculture heavy economy which be way more than few percent of rich farmer i think when you discuss such huge bill you should compare it with other nation who have go with the route of corporatisation or what they call be a free market theory every country be different it would have be great if you could have add a section of what we can learn from west economy who have already do that there be no country in west be farmer suicide have decrease in fact it have only increase whether it america spain etc for a country like india which be now push back to more poverty and hunger will this be good move now i think the problem be not the intent of the policy but why can not there be any small case study to prove this work for a country like a small state first to see if this will work before implement all over india and why can not the government do that first before shove the bill through without consultation and flawed voice vote we all know the performance of this government when it come to implement policy into action for a country like india which already have so many farmer suicide i personally feel our country need to find a right balance between policy of socialism and free market
a a indian i be support them till yesterday a they be protest without violence later on see all these today in medium i neither consider them a protester nor farmer i even now feel shame to tell them a indian after what they do in red fort and how they attack police and mainstream medium
now poor farmer will suffer again if crop get destroy by calamity then the burden will again fall on tax payer and moreover bjp have give a hope and show peacefuls a way that if they protest enough caa can also be repeal if they put enough pressure on government
these law be so good for indian economy and farmer but these pay goon win only rich farmer with vast land and with political connection win that be it it will keep the middleman bribe culture alive same happen on nrc caa same happen with this law

the analysis be one side the new bill only provide for additional opportunity for the farmer this in no way remove obliterate apmcs apmcs till today have no competition because the farmer be force to sell there and the trader in the apmcs could cartelise against farmer when the consumer purchase from any shop that he wish why not make available the same benefit to farmer the decision be for farmer to take on where to sell the apmcs may sense competition offer them a good rate and hence may have a chance to improve their relevance currently farmer get about 30 of the value pay by the consumer if the same be at 50 the farmer income would go up more than 100 consider input and other cost the apmc act modification and removal of restriction have be earlier push by the congress government also in fact most of the state have adopt major apmc reform in fact state like kerala have no apmc and there the farmer get relatively good return for their produce a compare to other state about 50 of the value pay by the consumer also the congress manifesto of 2019 specifically mention removal of apmc restriction this current drama be only poltically motivate good return for farmer without disturb the price pay by the consumer can only happen by bring about efficiency and transparency in the market mechanism in any case this be only an additional opportunity for farmer which be upto the farmer to take a decision on whether to make use of or not

3 40 farmer tax pay to apmc mandi maintains roads that connect to mandis and thus enable transport of the produce if mandis not maintain maintenance of these will be affect okay if private competitor come will they airlift all the produce be not private company go to arrange easy access to the produce for themselves they will once they can why be these facility not good already 70 year after independence that too in india be bread basket or whatever we teach in school because nobody have care till now
it be true that the farm law can not completely solve the problem infact in long term it pose many threat too but retrieve already inefficient apmc mandi system be just like want to go back to jail it have always exploit the farmer but in that light the farm law be certainly a revolutionary reform for the sector but some research in bihar have prove that mere take off of apmc system be not go to benefit farmer rather than put them in a far more stressing condition so the farm law eventhough have many good point in it will benefit farmer only if the loop hole in the law be closed one of the main concern be exploitation by big private player and agriculture be not like any other sector we can not predict nature and hence the harvest so that the farm law will not turn into another apmc style also the agriculture sector and the system in india be so complicate but it be noteworthy that south indian state have different system to get max profit for their produce one of the system be uzhavar santhai in tamil nadu it be an interesting system

the farmer have to be an optimist or he wouldnt still be a farmer
the explanation of farm bill be what my friend call a non farmer explain what the farmer need the rule of sell in the district market be not at all prevalent in south my fiend grow in madurai and sell in trivandrum and he do not even know the rule the main apprehension be that the government will bring an end to free electricity to farmer the law have never apply in south india but the suspicion against central government be very deep
dalal would tell the rate to farmer and farmer will have to sell a per dalal rate
as far a i understand the bill be for company not for farmer
proud of my farmer brother
another disadvantage of contract farming be that a company might ask for specific quality of crop which farmer cant ensure a crop grow under open sky unlike potato chip in factory so if there excess rain or presence of weed in crop that will increase the price of harvest therefore harm the already poor farmer
with a large section of indian population be who be farmer livelihood at stake it be natural for them to suspect the intention of the current ruler see the botched implementation of gst and bad decision like demonetization one can not simply accept anything throw on oneself without protest althoug the current set of farm law be look ground breaking at face one can not ally the fear what might happen when these be implement similar situation have occur in u with negative result where corporates have take undue advantage i think these law need to be redo with extensive discussion with farmer from every state and a slow but careful implementation need to be think out the devil always remain in the detail

probably modi think nehru mean farmer hence farmer must be torture why modi leave torturing army like kill of alavandan army man
without a farmer participation in an msp framework these law be detrimental

after watch this i certainly know that common people have so much little knowledge of the bill and why farmer be protest it it be like yeah farmer be ask for something and government be deny that also the farming sector be not that much role in our gdp but it straightly provide u with food and contribute a lot in employment the bill be simply to kill the mediator and control the farmer a reliance and big corporate house want to enter into the retail chain system and for that they want to produce packed everything at cheap price it be good but it certainly kill a lof of current employment and uncertainty to farmer the corporates buy straight from the farmer and there be a big chance that they try to dupe farmer to stretch their profit a they get all the knowledge power and money it will make some farmer happy also as long a they be comply with the corporates on the quality and price corporate buy big and store it to late produce that good for a long period of time example you could get tomato at very cheap price when it be produce in abundance process that to ketchup and sell it at a high cost with more shelf life we need to eventually move to that stage a right now the product be not properly be stock and a lot of reliable good be destroy but we government could solve it via prove good storage facility but no government want to remove their hand from this and hand it to corporates anyway this bill sound good just for the people who willing to purchase a tomato can pure than fresh tomato rest it be not that great for farmer and people who buy fresh

protest be against government but they go up to red fort and hoist their flag which mean they be fight against india not it be government

it be also important to make necessary amendment regard the concept of msp by add a clause or section whatever this should be do after all the necessary discussion from the lead agricultural union in the country or to be more precise it can be do by develop an app where any farmer from any part of country can give his her opinion on this matter
god bless our farmer
what a andolan superb salute to all farmer
shame on you ndtv instead of say bjp mp you have write it a ex congress mp
what happen to modi in punjab
logic itself be flaw a they go to farmer protest to gain insight about govt v farmer it would make more sense to also go to non protestors and understand why these law will work technically sample space be skew
modi can never help anyone except rich indian good initiative this should continue till pm resignation
when modi bring something then you guy bent upon to paint him a dictator but when he correct climb down you guy do not want to say that he respect democratic value eventhough it be a bit late he do not want to give leverage to opposition and get united under sharad pawar he also need to break the khalistani leverage within farmer group the farmer protest could have linger even for year with their illegal money fly from anti national movement of course he need consider overall propects of his political party a a prominent leader of it
pls also watch open letter analysis of farm bill
manish ji in a democracy the burden of proof be on those who wish to impose limit on trade and commerce these 150 year old chain put by british on our farmer need to be cut burden of proof be on those shout to keep them not on the government who be try to cut them
sir the big question be that our farmer be sit on road for last 2 month they do not do any such activity why suddenly today even a child can tell that there be political conspiracy behind this brutal protest so that image of indian farmer can be destroy in the eye of indian citizen politician should be ashamed for such heinous activity that too on our republic day
this be not expect we know the problem of the farmer but every situation have to be in limit it be our republic day
1st law if all the farmer will sell their crop directly to the company then apmc will be end soon and also the food corp of india will also be close or terminate after that most of these company will refuse to take crop at msp and because a farmer already spend money on the cultivation he will not have other option to sell his crop at low price
when modi turn 21 in 1971 india be fight it third war with pakistan
government must respect farmer and pay attention to their demand
when govt be assure farmer will getbetter price then make msp a guarantee whats the problem
issue 1 might lead to hoard and black marketing 2 issue 1 unawareness of farmer about their right eg shanta kumar committee say only 6 hh get msp benefit 2 this lead to non implementation of scheme 10281 suicide in 2019 in india despite various govt reform
all the tax which be there they be not put on farmer if msp be 2000 farmer sell crop at 2000 tax be pay by buyer not farmer and apmc in punjab be lot easy to reach with in 3 to 5 km
it mean farmer be free from mandi dalals exploitation now good news
farmer of our country will live poorly and the people that be here to support this the bill be to commercialize farm so that investment could be do and the tool that farmer of our country have could be mordenized for example combiners and harvester provide to farmer ob the company expense
future of farmer be be organic farm
3 allow farmer to sell their produce anywhere and remove the mandi system which on the face may look good but it doesnt leave the government option and leave farmer to compete with big business who can afford the transportation and sale destroy local small farmer

very good action by the govt and police these idle goon in the name of farmer protester need to get lesson

thank you for your presentation on the repeal of the farm law and the present problem farmer face central government should facilitate extension study and train for farmer so that they can learn about the item you have cover in this presentation central and local government should create avenue where the farmer can sell their product locally for appropriate price this will give the consumer the opportunity to avail fresh farm product and the farmer will get fair price for their product the government should also make funding and technology available to the farmer at all level so that they can have access to appropriate climate control storage young people should also step in to social entrepreneurial role to solve these problem for the farmer

i come from an india where mainstream medium have sell out their imaan zameer just for the sake of trp how can these journalist be so shameless ki khuddari hi bech di ho bina common sense lagae
how delhi police could highjack kejriwal govt public bus for stop farmer
farmer unable to pay middleman be money be not that the reason for farmer be suicide
personally i be happy about this new farm law because this motivate a new generation of young farmer who have new farm idea be and can sell either to the government or to the big corporate buyer and make money free of tax all dream be shatter
if modi have gut let him change fci into food corporation of punjab haryana and start another system for rest of india
bihar have implement these law 15years back and you can see where they end now they work in punjab and haryana
kissan never will vote to bjp till murkh leader ship will be charge like modi and amit
this u turn be deeply disturbing and make me loose confidence in democracy it appear that modi care only about election win and cling to power thousand of silent farmer have be betray for electoral gain
be sc sleep or what sc have allow farmer protest how can they arrest
government tweaking of the commodity or it price have to be see a an action of extreme situation and other time the market force must prevail if the problem lie with intermediary agency there should be legal provision to contain action like hoard and artificial market manipulation government should try minimise the intermediary and get producer more easy access and transport of their produce to market framer need only such help otherwise the market will determine the value however there be a global glut and price drop that would destabilise the living income of the farmer to a disastrous state they may have to be rescue by offer minimum price for such commodity to protect the farmer and keep him on the farm until the market price can support the commodity these difficulty for the farmer be world over occasional socialism may be require to balance the book
it be not political party be lose you bloody polititians it be the loss for poor farmer k you
my full support ti farmer and aap
why modi or amitshah do not visit the farmer protest site all these 9 month and promise the farmer of msp agriculture be a state subject but bill be pass with out consult state and by cancel question hour in parliament when the bill be pass completely unconstitutional
hello sir i want to ask if there come a system of outside apmc a mention in the first act so there come a loop hole for moneylender and others to exploit farmer so the main reason for apmc to exist in first place will be lapse so what about it sir
purchase at minimum support price msp and rest be purchase at low
sir this video provide me a clear view of farm bill everyone have to go through your class include farmer and politician do not know why this bill be go to withdraw by govt
god bless all these farmer to fight for their right
i understand the insecurity of farmer but at the same time how long big farmer will be under father be umbrella
farm law well intentioned but modi govt falter in communication
highly samful for the government and other people also who think that farmer be do wrong
medium be disappoint they should have educate farmer on the benefit and con of farmer law
3 punjab farmer be the rich farmer in india per data they get power subsidy fertilizer subsidy pm kisan benefit few state govt subsidy it amount to min 1 5 lakh benefit per each farmer per month pubjub be most backward in agri market compare to maharashtra and karnataka when will they change if their mindset be stick to exist comfort zone
anyways the basic problem still remain green revolution gm crop food independance farmer grow gm crop and stop oil seed millet for the additional profit it promise
2 government middle man hatana chahti hai taki farmer exploit na ho commission se lekin farmer ka ye kehna hai ki unhe middle man ki service ki bhi zarurat hai transportation cost bachti hai kyunki baar baar farmer apni produce market mei lae agar rate naa mile to ghar vaapis lekar jae isse transportation cost increase hoti hai aur produce kharab hone ka bhi dar rehta hai moisture humidity iska bohot role rehta hai crop ko deteriorate karne mei phir storage cost produce crop uttarna chardhana har ek choti se choti cheez ka rate hota hai lekin ye sab middle man karta hai to farmer islye isse oppose kar rhe hain lekin vo commission bhi leta hai isliye government hatana chahti hai farmer ye bhi bolte hain ki agar kabhi unhe paisa ki zarurat hoti hai emergency mein to vo middle man ke pas jaa skte hain fertilizer kareedne hon ya kuch aur paisa lagte hain farm karne mein free mein nhi hoti bhai ya behen gender dekh kar lga lena
from now we do not support terrorist farmer shame on that farmer protest we do not need violence but in peace
it be great idea to liberaze the agriculture in india but ofc punjabi people dont want to go forward and they be just scar of competition in the free market i hope prime minister modi ji will finally fully liberaze indian market but he need time and even this people which dont udenstand how good be it will not stop him jai hind
election hein aur ab yaad aaya ki yeh kisan hein warna yeh toh andolan jeevi hein
respect to farmer
farmer have be protest peacefully for 2 3 month and most of them still be but minority do get violent however what have not be show be how the police be beat up some protester who be cause no trouble at all some even speculate that these riot be plan by the government to put farmer in the bad light but no one really know farmer have be protest to have the newly introduce bill back

the best video on farm bill be make by print thank you shekar gupta
on the other hand this would naturally welcome private trader middleman with their wealth resource education tech now how logistics etc and would be buy produce across state global at odd time with low price give to the indian farmer thereby these private trader middleman will become hoarder and this evil would be disastrous for the indian farmer and the country
there be not a farmer u pagal
there be plenty of open land govt do not need to take farmer land
support farmer
this be the age of social medium within hour reality have be expose this be another try of shaheen bagh but will also see the same fate a shaheen bagh modi ji will only gain more out of these disruption
great video articulately explain i will like to add something which have not be cover in the video protestors against the farm law have be raise a matter of legalize msp i e ask for govt to make it illegal for anyone to buy below the minimum support price which will be above the equilibrium price
bjp sp bsp congress sb k the usme

i support farmer protest for the sustainability of future generation
be fund farmer agitation because they have a vested interest in
many big farmer in india have bond labourer in their field and they be talk about right hypocrisy
le congress we will help arrest people free of cost in court and will donate blanket in jail and will still say that danga toh bjp ke gundo ne kiya red fort pe
if tikait succeed in break this monopoly of the corrupt then he will truly unite indian people into a multiracial movement and change indian politics forever
this withdrawal i be sure have hurt yogiji from within i be sure he would never have go back like modiji have he be the pm time the hindus start get more vocal and start defend their right or else we and more our future generation will have to pay the brunt
if all farmer stop there farm then fix the price of all farming product with govt then start farm
great leader be p m modi ji
rakesh tikait jindabad
if chaiwala can become a pm twice of a country then farmer know farm than anyone else
last one why farmer have not right in these bill to file a case in court why they need to depend on sdm or tehsildaar local case win who will able to pay more black money farmer will more exploited
great living punjabi great living indian be manmohan sir
even u farmer be suffer because of few corporation control the entire farming industry
best and deep information for farmer
wat a hopeless government farmer be our back bone not ambani or adani treat them respectfully
haryana be home minister be concern about kangana but he be not concern about laathicharge on farmer in haryana
gupta ji please do not brush aside the concern of those who oppose because it be unlikely that a farmer have the choice to transport and sale his produce wherever price be high also a of today only 6 of farmer get msp benefit so msp be not remove do not hold much water also there be potential to corporatise agriculture which be unlikely benefit farmer remember jio
bjp can not win punjab and they know it
farmer be fight for country
it be show clearly they be fully fund from outside to rakesh and want our india never and ever be develop country
hello ge i need clarification here in second bill u say middle man can again take advantage of famers due to persecution but govt already eradicate middle man in 1st bill so by which farmer can directly sell to the consumer from use 2 bill transperantly
dont you know every year more than fifteen thousand farmer commit suicide basically these bill be for the benefit of farmer ultimate goal be farmer should be pay more no more suicide well and sustainable farming technique and more security of farmer interest
thanks to our constitution right to protest win farmer win
proud to be the son of farmer thnxx for raise voice of farmer dhruv rathi
poor farmer with poor car protest in a low income country usa and most of them belong to poorest state in india in term of agriculture punjab
these farm law would have industrialise farming in india but ala india should have accept rcep these farmer would have be obliterate by industrialized australian and argentine farmer in the indian market
3 why have apmc since 1965 still ensure only 6 of farmer be get msp
these be only few example due to heavy loss there be many farmer suicide in southern and central state
if you do not need it then we do not need it go forward if you manipulate price arkej or soga or maba may believe you but we indian will not
farmer be smart than modi i be mind blow by their understanding of the system
those say why be there more sikh in these protest becoz the green revolution start from this region which make india self sufficient in food punjab haryana and up organisation be well inform they have lawyer judge and doctor in their cadre they know exactly what be these law they be very clear about the law the only confused case of india be the government and some stupid people of india who think modi will do everything good for them modi do not do good for his own state be farmer cotton be procure for gujarati farmer at 1300 in manmohan singh govt in 2013 and in 2020 it price be 700 thats what modi be do to farmer
it be a win of ignorance lack of drive to understand the bill and lack of empathy for other farmer but anyway democracy be a popularity contest
america be one of the few country who dare to challenge taliban what do india do we do not send our force america prevent taliban from grow for 20 year
more power to farmer satyamev jayate
i think these bill be milestone for farmer and govt should not take step back some modification can be do by govt but replenishment of bill will impact on farmer in a long term
so clearly explain and now it be crystal clear what the farmer be go through
rakesh ji tikaat be not only a farmer he be a baabar sher on farmer
journalist protest only against government when they feel govt be not right but never counter protest against the protestors when they feel govt law be right do not matter if it be farmer protest if you feel law be correct then you should go and counter protest
why do you not highlight the fact mention by nc saxena at 7 46 he clearly mention that not just the government be buy wheat at almost twice the price from the farmer it have not increase the price of sell to the poor please do not mislead nave people be unbiased in your analysis there be no difference between you and that chaudhary guy from znews just that you be on the opposite side bharat mata ki jai
difference between china and india china can progress well by implement good change whereas india can not implement any change due to their political system about this farmer be issue i watch a documentary how political opposition be gather non farmer to impersonate a real farmer and create unnecessary trouble the solution to all indian problem be to give prime minister modi same power a chinese president have over decision make for his country but that will make india a super power which could be a good thing for the world a i have learn from indian history that india can only spread the message of peace non violence since ancient time i have never see original indian be aggressive or violent in fact indian have never be good at fight and war bear in mind that almost 33 of indian population now be not original indian
every one have right to protest peacefully but public should not be disturb govt and farmer should talk on this matter bussinessman like adani should not be allow to purchase farmer crop small farmer should be help by government big farmer should give tax to govt msp should be give to farmer
how pathetic these people be in comment say we support farmer just by see this video well do india
i be an indian farmer i will tell you this this issue be relate to only 2 state that be punjab and haryana no where else farmer be protest in india for a long time farmer in punjab and haryana grow at the expense of other farmer in india now that their monopoly be break they be cry about it i repeat i have no issue with the farm law bring by government of india
and i want say within few week it will 1year complete farmer protest so we will support them becoz godi medium will not support they will defame them
no farmer in protest they all leave goon
this farmer want msp even sell to private player what nonsense this be if that private player start import agriculture product for benefit then price of food skyrocket this go to whole level destruction
imwithfarmer
very sad political party be responsible for all these the vehicle of bjp be leader hit the farmer and kill them they should be punish accord to law the death of innocent be very unfortunate failure on the part of state government
well we will have to wait for kolkata election to see whether the general public support modi or the farmer only if the bjp do badly in these election will we see an early settlement
also this agitation be ignite by land owner large tract of land of dalits the oppressed community be grab during khalistan movement not the cultivator and worker who actually who work in farm and be treat in subhuman ecosystem
i hope modi ji govt must withhold these reform bill give a thorough rethinking involve farmer input let our indian farmer not feel insecue at the hand of welcome middlement private trader to manage their produce this will save the nation will save modi ji dream of nav bharat
again i think dispute be really hard to win for the farmer incase of any misadventure from these company unless atleast the poor farmer be give unconditional protection from exploitation in any court and at least be able to get back their expences for the loss due to the misunderstanding from the clause hop the educate farmer be at least aware of the contract and what they be sign into
jab farmer protest tha jab bjp kyu nhi milne aayi you be mr choudhary saab
one major assumption be that most farmer use the mandi system the figure be around 50 50 those who like use mandi system like the fact they store storage system credit etc while others dislike it because of corrupt official out side of mandi there be no msp and frankly most marginal farmer sell out of mandis only
i m indian with few of my family farmer now leme tell you the news be seriously wrong and bias many farmer think nothing of the law and most think it a good thing few in 2 state dont like it now you know
i think godi medium should learn how to do report from u
me too son of farmer can understand whole scenario
18 05 couple of point 1 if contract do for 2000 company can not arbitrarily reduce price afterwards and have to honor it a per the rule 2 if company offer contract price of 500 down from 2000 for next contract why the presenter say that the farmer do not have a choice the farmer be still free to contract with someone else offer high price or he she may choose to cultivate whatever and sell it in apmc at msp price a that structure be still present
grain in punjab haryana msp r 1950 why it r 950 in madhya
shame on lawmaker of india who dont keep in mind the need of the people but on the contrary support and please the rich private corporates whats the use sit and watch the republic day parade with pride when these kind of violent protest be happen on the periphery of the celebration shame on modi govt and the high authority

it be easy to say sorry but what to 700 farmer who lose their life
do modi pull back from the farm law make some andh bhakts eye open i hope so
black day only for broker mandi walas real farmer be happy with the bill
those who support these protect first study farm law before comment or support any side no one open eye last 70 year when farmer do mass sucides because there be no reform now reform be here why protect
shame on zee tv few day back you be show that the broders be empty now to defame the leader you be show now that farmer be on road in rain etc where be you early
if farmer can sell directly and farmer be give freedom then that mean the people who be protest be the middleman or the agent then all this protest be for this agent or middleman in the name of farmer a it be easy to gain sympathy over farmer name
chalo zee news ne inhe kisan to mana

i stand with the farmer it be high time that we a citizen stand up against this fascist regime and question this government for fill the pocket of the so called industrialist

farmer r protest just on the basis of forecast or assumption like this may happen or that may happen however farmer r free to sell their crop anywhere if they think that deal with corporates will lead to extinction of mandi system than they should stick to old system that be sell their crop in mandi
their demand for recognition of msp a statutory right whittle down of the the commission for air quality management in national capital region and adjoin area ordinance 2020 and withdrawal of case on farmer seem unreasonable and naive for follow reason

meghnad have perhaps intentionally not explain that the process of price discovery just fail in the apmc mandis because the licensed middle men collude together rather than compete against each other and quote a single price which be always equal to or very slightly more than the msp this be simply because the whole apmc system itself be stupid from the very inception and directly facilitate this
the ordinance for this bill be already there for past 6 month this guy completely overlook the hyperbole from the opposition politician death warrant of farmer black law etc etc while talk about kangana be equally idiotic terrorist barb at the same time not so balanced a you claim yourself to be
only guarantee law on msp can change the life of farmer

very informative and educative video the presenter be very clear in understand and express it to the viewer in the medium a some one comment this video should be dub in several language especially hindi so that the farmer can directly relate to their problem and the solution i be only hop that the corruption and black money do not come in to play between the apmc and the farmer i hope the govt will consider all the loop hole and plug them before the bill become a legal way for the supply chain it be not clear from the video whether the farmer be protest to enforce the msp minimum support price by the govt be include in the bill also it be so very difficult to establish the msp for a particular product for the entire country since the labor in the farming will be so different between state to state

mohak silently say that farm bill be good but the problem be only of trust
the msp also have same problem if supply increase and cost of priduction equal msp then farmer be finish contract price however protects downside contract buy at pre agree price even if price fall that season why this be leave out small farmer will shift to contract farmi8ng when they see this a wiser choice mandis will still be available and apmc too a optioons this be renegoriated change govt already agrees and modi say msp will still be there who will sell at msp when either contract price give high or market5 price go up at mandis the last leg of this how to create access to small farmer other than contract farm this can be thrash out easily if union demand creation of supply chain cold storage logistics by government or private sector instead ofr negotiate such very negotiable demand demand socilaist era bottleneck to be in place forever smother the farmer into state subisdy dep endency stagnation and poverty presentation say mandis be run by state government leave out rule party be men politician and rich farmer get into them naturally such loss or privilege to determine price for poor farmer be lose and such party like akalid dal oppose control of manids and option outside mandis for poor farmer put simply it be actually rich farmer and rich farmer political leader run mandis who tell poor farmer they will perish if they leave this triangle of mandis they control a msp that flat line and subsidy into contract protect price crash and freedom to sell in others state and commodity market

even bjp have no simple mind why not put ample number of person to find out the costing of each product produce by farmer and work our the price for seek with margin which can reduce tbier dependency on loan from either bank or sarafi each and every state u have different cost factor if they would have do this no body can argue that there u any loophole to favoure any big corporates so definately no chance if argue ment bjp be slip like kumbhakaran take for grant that whatever they be do be perfect but it be no way true for 14 crore farmer they can give 1millionnjobs from farmer community itself to take care of any problem issue woe from farmer commu nity to address thier problem so then definately nobody can blame bjp govt but bjpnis not sincere about this indpife if implementing farmer crop insurance nbut i be sure it have noway reach 14 crore farmer if it would have reach not even a single farmer have sucide but even bjpnschdme s be turn out to be as good a congress use to announce feel new congress have bear jaihind har har har mahadev mahadev mahadev

i think bengal should cancel rally fr bjp
the government say there will be an msp but can it assure whether procurement will be do at msp can it give a write assurance that farmer will get msp for their produce question one of the many farmer protest against the bill
why be the government act silly farmer be the backbone of our economy they should be out there in field not on road please make peace with the farmer

mr shekhar gupta i be point out another case of the government be inaction we know our most difficult neighbor be pakistan and pakistan be brain sits in lahore a city of 1 25 crore population and the capital of it most populous province punjab both lahore and amritsar be consider twin city dr manmohan singh want to reach out to the intelligentcia of lahore from it close window in amritsar he start the construction of an fm tower 300 meter high in 2006 but 15 year in the work this high powered external service radio station have not become operational pakistan be talk to amritsar use a battery of 6 radio transmitter 3 high power medium wave transmitter and 3 fm transmitter in return we can not make even one high power fm transmitter operational modi government be leave hand do not know what it right hand be do
so why do punjabi farmer benefit from msp while the other indian farmer do not that be not fair either so either all farmer should get msp or none at all
bjp son hit the farmer and now 4 farmer be dead so that we do it okkkkkkk
ok so after see the entire video you have just reiterate the think tank niti aayog 2018 report about reduce the procurement of wheat and rice from haryana and punjab alright i get your point but what everyone should keep in mind be it india that we be live in and the current govt just act on a whim and do not involve the people like educate them what you have not describe in this video be the impact of these upcoming bill on a farmer yes i totally agree that the apmcs need to be fix but the system work there be problem but it work and we all know what happen with gst demonetisation etc
obviously a similar situation can not be rule out for local good trade by the local small farmer vi a vi his corporate client
give farmer their right they be also indian
then these law can be implement by state government that will help the state eventually and that state could become a role model of prosperous farmer
hence instead of this mindset mentality that best quality will get msp and anything else will get below msp on gradual level be wrong this be exploitation mentality and result be farmer suicide who couldnt sustain
one day indian will proud on you ravish sir thousand salute

nice video on farm bill 2020 i have see many video but could not understand when i have see ur video i have understand every process and new term about farm bill 2020 thanku sir
during meeting centre ensure msps they will make ammendments for that they have also give that they will allow civil court in these bill but the farmer protestors do not want that also they only want to take 3 bill bcoz they be middleman and not the farmer
govt be ready to give assurance about msp in write format but not willing to mention in particular law that be hypocrisy how can be this explain your video be more tilted toward problem of apmc law rather than what potential threat can be generate by private player if they allow to procure agril product below msp when govt can change previous apmc act and can build new law to make cold storage and can make another provision for quick and efficient transportation of agricultural product then why to give such grand way to private market player to control economy why cooperative structure very well establish and prove best in maharashtra and gujarat in case of sugarcane industry n milk production respectively or farmer produce organization fpo be not give more attention than give more control to few capitalist family
you make u cry dear seeing be believe after 1984 sikh be portray a separatist or khalistanis bcz of the medium be not show the real picture now this generation have see what kind of people be these 3 who always stand for injustice whether it on them or someone be else this be a teaching of our guru

tikait ji yeah tho bol do yaar vote for bjp only
bjp people top to bottom ready tell lie haryana bjp cm be also not exceptional
i support farm law anti farm law protest be itself anti farmer and anti national period
even if these 3 bill still become a reality think of middleman who would ensure small farmer that they would transport their yield and sell it at high price in far off location a small farmer would not have the time and transport capability to drive at least 100 km think of tax levy on state border on farmer who be transport their yield in different state now all the highway be go to be flood with tractor and cause a lot of traffic get on ground reality and then make decision
this will help the government propoganda of double the farmer income by 2022
aap mla be member be post a lot of video on this channel about bjp inc be corruption but the problem be we do not have many follower on this platform to increase the awareness level we must have to focus on increase the subscriber of this channel if we can comment on this channel why can not we comment request on other channel to subscribe aap yt channel if you agree with me then the main question that arise be how where we can request others to subscribe to this channel we can request to subscribe to this channel in different language by share the link we can target every news channel political party channel vlogs etc through an emotional morally correct caption this way we can help this party to grow across pan india
70 farmer lose their life till now only intention of our current government be to make their corporate friend rich and common people suffer due unorganised lockdown on 22 march 2020 onwards be the major disaster for the citizen of india modi already sell most government company to his friend but modi forget farm be not a business for farmer it be a religion not for only farmer for all them who eat food today

modi ji all your good effort be be detail by this gunda tikat
i do not have enough economic and farm acumen to definitively have an opinion on these bill but from this video it apparent neither do mr shekhar
in my opinion the law should have be withdraw month ago because one can easily see that lakh of people in guise of farmer have surround delhi and they be entrench so much that they could have surround delhi for not only month but year together
do this bill have anything to say about msp and it be view on mandi be future legal existence
feel proud on farmer respect
he be totally mislead it be not the small farmer but mostly the middleman who be protest
bill pass now they be try to capture farmer attention for upcoming election if they really oppose then why akali dal still with bjp

farmer be farmer irrespective from which state they come and serve with one motive to fee the country
because growth typically mean increase efficiency so by that justification a farmer in 2020 should have good modern technology than the one in 1972 and the corn yield he produce today should ideally be high and per kilo the price can either be same or less because now he have more yield also with new technology he should be diversify his crop because ideally a lot of farm work be automate by machine and he have more time
5 in the exist apmc system it be mandatory for farmer to go through a trader via mandis so a to sell their produce to consumer and company and they receive msp minimum selling price for their produce it be this very system that have influence the riseto a cartel lead by trader and uncompetitive market due to which the farmer be pay low price than msp set by govt for their produce so in a way these farm bill will destroy the monopoly of govt run market ie apmc
why farmer of state other than punjab hariyana western up be not agitate against these new law

the government be main approach be to cut off the various middle men link that exists in the country because the supply be reguated at least twice before reach the city or town market the different tier of middle men create their own profit which indeed exploit the original price which be earn by the farmer if the law will cut out these men then most probably farmer can earn good price but the implementation sparkle protest because many of these farmer who be out here protest be themselves part of local trade link or have not clearly understood the government be plan also i personally think it be because the congress political party have fund punjab farmer a punjab be a congress state and the party have influence there to simply defame bjp central government and a you can see the protester be all punjabi and not even a single person can be see who be not punjabi
the approach towards farmer be shock

if the government have follow a practice for 60 year and it know that theres an extra or oversupply of these grain then it have to be the government which have to handhold the farmer to change the crop pattern like incentive be give by haryana government away from what the government ask the farmer to begin with initially in 1960s to overcome the food shortage rightfully the successive government should have begin this around the time the oversupply begin like early pu jab have lot of maze oil seed etc down but they change the crop pattern to wheat rice a the government want this to be do with the water table recede oversupply of some crop vis a vi an under supply of other crop we be now import therefore the successive government should have by now begin to incentivise the farmer to the crop which be in short supply with an assured msp and their procurement in few year the farmer would develop confidence and an equilibrium would be reach in crop diversification

now those farmer should protest who want to pass these bill not only farmer i think everyone who support these bill should come forward and stop this repealing of bill
legal what will happen if repeal bill do not get majority
seem for the moment a good decision from an electrol perspective but how long the reform be go to get stall like this especially when this be an issue only relate to vested interest of some section of one state or a rich section belong to one caste and rest of the india be not much worry or rather it more of a beneficial law let me ask a question why a particular state or caste need to be keep silent by feed with money that can be spend for great good for the country especially this will impact only the middleman and so call farmer will be still under their control and their own fate other state have show good result and move forward every law need to be discuss and gov use an opportunity to bypass the parliament i believe government do give enough explanation in parliament and most political party have this reform a a part of their manifesto no one have gut to implement it l can understand if it be relate to land reform or if it impact regional linguistic or cultural aspect or major constitutional amendment except for 370 and 371 of this nation that definitely need a wider discussion and more careful analysis even a law that have wide implication be pass without much deliberation or less discussion ie nep so accord to sekhar sir be logic any law that impact punjab or haryana or western up need to be discuss explicitly discuss in parliament and rest be fine or can be ignore sorry i do not take to this point may be a bit harsh but it be a fact
very good for farmer jai hind jai bharat

those who r say that this bill would open different way for farmer just note that corporation be control by businessmen they would buy crop at even low price than msp and would sell them at much elevate price to the consumer just to make more profit and this situation can not be prevent because corporates be not transperant and no arrangement and measure be make against these situation by the government in these so called bill so in short this bill be a big fuck you to consumer and producer
part of the interviewer reaction be so insincere by both manisha and atul lousy interview the only person who be sincere here be rakesh tikait
their unity can atleast see through a couple of year of corporates enter the farming sector in rest of the country later they can decide if they do not want corporates they can still remain united and maybe protest then with real life bad example of this bill instead of protest in assumption in that case the entire nation will understand and stand by the protest instead of just 2 state

i be with the farmer but not with the state government of punjab and some 400 500 artiyas who rule the roost this protest be by for and of artiyas who fear they will lose 5k to 7k crore annual income to them and the state by way of tax charge which be 6 7 they be try to create fear that corporates ambani adani will take away their land and what not the artiyas bicholiyas be also private individual and everybody know how they deal with the farmer the fear of the artiyas be that the farmer will be free from their chungal
accord to one of the three law of the government they now allow the corporates to do contract farm it sound good theoretically but in reality many of the farmer in this nation be not much literate enough to read and understand the sesquipedalian contract by these corporates and this will be harmful in the long run assume that a farmer sow the potato but the company say that this be not their kind of seed and they show the contract to farmer and file a lawsuit and the farmer be life be destroy
i have never see such a bias reporter and channel in my life why do not you rename zee news a bjp news
just a suggestion to new laundry when you make joke about modi or bhakts you actually detach a huge chunk of population out of the conversation make them immediately close the video there be people who idolize him so if you want to engage and change their perception so that their voting behaviour become more rational you get ta make your video more inclusive jibe of bhakt will only make them even more polarized this message also go to each and everyone reading it engage not confront after all irrespective of our ideology we share one common thing that be love for india jai hind
great modi ji super duper would leader jay hind jay bharat great modi ji
if poor farmer can afford 33 6 crore of rupee on one event how much have be spend on agitation
if real farmer have any problem comeout from tikait chal and talk to any educate people and ask or discuss their worry upon the bill

one of friend he be a farmer from raichur karnataka he use to farm tomato and wen he go to apmc they u use to bid for start from 10 rupee for 25 kilo max to max he could get be 30 rupee for 25 kilo so he stop
holistic organic farming be the key to india be food security but at the same time the plutocracy surround indian farmland and contractual labour and the entrapment do by apmc trader should also be look into and also state govt have the power to bypass the farm bill so the protest do not make sense i think one should look at the data that come out from the state that have implement the new act after some year and then make any judgement regard the same

it disheartening to see well intentioned folk fall to propaganda of bjp on the farm law
the armed force of afghanistan will need to show some spine and also act wisely it be not time to go on the offensive and spread itself thin which will in fact favor the taliban but to rather make a strategic retreat fall back and regroup to defend important city exhort the warlord and their militia to join in the fightback while conscript the able body men and woman to fight against the talibani onslaught
so big corporate hoarder will create artificial glut to buy cheaply from the farmer and then create artificial scarcity to sell dearly to the end consumer so basically a lose lose situation for both farmer and consumer and a win win situation for the private firm

apmc can eat rs 91 per kg and getaway big corporates can not they would need to show on their balance sheet a roce return of capital employ of over 1100 will lead to heavy scrutiny even if big corporates make huge profit say 30 50 roce they could give farmer much more in return than the what farmer get in current apmc model
whether it farmer industrial worker or bjp or congress or anybody this nonsense be not acceptable

since when do a free market become a bad thing farmer in india shy away from grow organic produce and choose to grow sub standard gmo crop because of msp since they know the quality be of no relevance any quality be support by the government promise minimum support price a free market lead to competition amongst producer well investment in product which be relevant to market demand take the example of avocado across the world sustainable profitability for producer and also good quality product at a good price for the consumer a product like rice can not be monopolize by a large corporate because if that be true then amul have already monopolize the milk industry in india be the milk producer get fair value for their product yes because if amul will not pay the local producer a fair price someone else will or the milk producer will sell directly to the customer which they do even now the farmer protest be base on fear mongering and unfortunately a small percentage of educated class be also stand in their support out of confirmation bias just because it give them an opportunity to reaffirm their hate towards a political ideology
no farmer no food
it may also happen to many farmer on account of diverse produce a farm produce generally be subject to nature be vageries

see the farmer be smart enough to understand the fact that by only non violent mean they can win this war govt know something must be do to malign the whole movement
he do not use the word msp in whole video here then why show false statement on left side of the screen moreover msp be not mention in farm bill too
anyone tell me what good this bjp do for india other than make people to sleep in the street
hence govt must ensure that private sector as well a apmc can not purchase corp from farmer below msp make a healthy auction set a base price for a corp that be msp then who have the power they will buy from farmer thus it will create a open competitive market for buyer and also a fair mechanism for poor farmer
it be actually nothing just the anger of farmer use with wrong intention by other political party
whenever modi or bjp do not come in political reform will india not be progress
dear farmer brother from haryana and punjab we keralites be with u u feed this nation be a consumer state we be eat the food becoz you people be there please keep bjp away next time jai javan jai kisan

i support farmer people be now believe that farmer be be pay by the high party of india and canada one question for those people who believe this if this be so then why do not our pm narendra modi care to go to talk to them and to hear what they want why be not a press conference hold in a situation like this because our pm be an utter failure and he will not be able to face any of the question of the medium
do not forget that everything start after bjp pass farm bill unconstitutionally in parliament

this government be spineless if i be in place of stupid modi then i would have call this tikait on one on one debate on national television and would have expose him completely with fact
sad day for small farmer
i have hear rakesh tikait many time he be always very witty but in this talk he have come out with lot of depth
i think the youth should watch and learn the majority of farmer be our elder youth off today would not have have the dedication and fight in them they be all worried about go to canada and drive truck
this initiative should have be communicate to the farmer a long time ago that these reform be come in their own vernacular
4 regularize msp even outside the apmc market i e free market which be introduce a per this new agriculture bill
hat off to all the farmer
tikait be a fool who be an agent of political party he do not even knw a word of what be write in the so called anti farmer law
it so hard to reform anything in india i do not think repel the law be the best for farmer they should have give state an option to opt in for farm law farmer be already suffer with mandis a parallel bargaining power could have be good for farmer but they fail to understand that
it be finally do good to hear that govt be take back farm law and it be necessary to pass a bill for msp make it legal but burn stubble should be illegal and no msp for farmer burning crop and please no subsidy for electricity and urea also govt should reduce tax on diesel and petrol
some negative dimension of create the difficulty in the short term but it be the reality that these provision can improve our farmer in the long term
i shall not vote to kezriwal in punjab because he himself have splitted the punjab aap by remove sardar khera a opposition leader and ignore aap mlas like kanwar sandhu dr gandhi etc by the way a a dictator do and s bhagwant maan have not also try to keep the unity of punjab aap for his own one man political interest

msp should be extend for private buyer too only then a farmer can hope for some profit
this enactment basically can alter the intended purpose of msp which be to provide a safety net and can make the msp a a price floor such intervention can deleterious for the agricultural sector a put up a price floor reduce the quantity demand significantly the buyer of the produce of the farmer will not be interested to buy at such a high price regardless of how much the farmer would like to sell a low quantity of the produce will be purchase this further create an obligation over the government to purchase all the produce at the msp price a the demand be kill by such price floor in place hence pump the fiscal deficit such move will effectively take away a chunk of total surplus of producer and seller and will be against the free market work
7 18 that be true and thats the reason why farmer in bihar be in extremely poor condition
i always support farmer
these factor will help farmer produce natural crop and will save ecological balance
nice informative video but leave without conclusion 1 be the new farm bill well or bad for country who will lose who will gain please add this last part thnx
so in conclusion this protest have nothing to do with farm bill but something that punjab want for past several year and that be their own rule and own country punjab either need to learn to reform or india need to find other channel govt should not be force to pay for poor quality product just because of set minimum if company run the show they wouldve have to do thing correctly and thats what these farmer all fear inability to cut corner
goverment decide that only low income farmer get benefit of msp so poor farmer first get benefit of this
i always support farmer and i will support farmer that be it
this law be good be farmer a he say it have nothing to do with msp mean they can sell at msp in the mandi but everyone want politics
1 farmer produce trade and commerce act 1 freedom of choice of sale and purchase eg outside mandis 2 barrier free inter and intra state trade 3 no need to pay ce and levy 4 electronic trading transparency and tine save 5 direct trading at farm gate cold storage process unit etc 6 elimination of middleman 7 clarification by govt msp system and mandis will continue

new farm bill be more vulnerable to monopoly atleast when you know that there be no limit on hoard when there should be also like you say that the product be perishable in nature hoard only help them exploit the producer farmer even more for eg a product with msp of r 100 for once be purchase at r 120 result in maximum produce and sale let be say twice the actual demand the remain produce can be hoard and in the next season trader buyer can either refuse to buy new product or ask them farmer to sell the same product at a half price because of their perishable nature farmer would not have other option but to agree also the potential player will be very limited and an open market say be just a gimmick because in the begin the product will be purchase at lucrative price which have never be offer earlier at price which can not be pay by others even with take huge loss on the account of buyer to kill a potential competition like it happen in the case of jio even idea and vodafone fail to survive which other buyer can take loss as much a adani in the agriculture sector anyone and then when the competition be dead there be no msp to protect farmer be interest mandis will close down eventually a they d largely remain non functional because of a good deal from the pvt buyer in the beginning like it happen with bsnl we already have see such market disaster in the recent time do not we learn anything from it how can farmer survive an exploitative monopoly which even idea and vodafone could not survive apmcs be atleast in the interest of farmer new farm bill actually make the producer farmer most vulnerable in apmcs trader license be give to those who be close to state govts and the govts keep change thus keep the cycle run open market with no law for msp unlimited hoarding and with giant like adani it be just delusional to expect a fair business take place even in an open market this monopoly be worse by a 100 mile when compare to the conventional system of apmcs

1 say whole india be against farm bill
think of it a any other industry let be say scooter in india it completely private million of indian people need scooter and continue to buy it from a handful of company technically they could form a cartel and raise the price together make a massive impact in the indian marketplace but do that really happen no because free market also encourage competition and especially in today be day and age if 10 company come together and raise price a new company will get set up see the discrepancy in margin pricing that they can take advantage off of simultaneously if they keep the price artificially low lure more and more people to buy scooter a they will have low margin and b once the demand pick up there will be more raw material require to keep up with the demand which would put pressure on the raw material resource and drive the price back up again else it will not be sustainable for the company to begin with and they will go bankrupt if they continue to sell the scooter at low price than what they can sustain
corporates will buy crop and store them but essential commodity act will stop them for store crop for long time a it increase price in market
this be why we need modi again he slam himself for the people of india salute democracy

i be with farmer

this be a great loss for true farmer
appreciate your clear analyse some point you have raise be hypothetical and for possible concern by farmer however the farmer should have list these issue clearly on the table when discuss in 11 meeting with the government they also fail to cooperate with the supreme court setup committee you may have a clear picture but the farmer union do not secondly what really happen in future be unknown if there be an issue it can be subsequently correct a i see it it will definitely bring good income to farmer my farmer relation be very happy that the middleman who take 2 5 commission in the past have be eliminate with the new law since the farmer do not pay tax on their produce this income be a major contributer to black money the new law will control the flow of fund because all go direct into farmer bank account there be more but i think this issue be so politicalized it benefit the opposition party who be fight for survival and therefore will keep this issue alive for sometime

accord to my opinion a i have spend one year a a visiting professor at one university in haryana the main problem be the private trading at the wholesale market and the entry of the big corporation in agriculture which the farmer do not like a they be afraid about their future the wholesale market must be in the hand of the government fci should extend the minimum support price for all kind of crop food and non food there should be new investment by the government to build new storage facility more irrigation for the whole of india this be the european common market agricultural policy and it be successful india should not follow the american system the problem in india be that most economist want to follow the american system which be not a success they call the introduction of the american system a reform

punjabi farmer or any other farmer for that matter be a source of pride for this nation but this call for repeal all the three act be totally unjustified
punjab me 2022 me election hai
at 2 33 00 you make a nice story that farmer cant get the msp in apmc probably just to justify that msp be waste so if there be no msp by private player it justified but since you be a knowledgeable person why you do not also mention that govt have too many agency to deal with corruption so do you want to say that all those agency do not know it or they do not work or they know or do not work
i m not an economist but have read the pioneer book by adam smith this bill be apparently in line of the suggestion by the prolific author also talk to a person from agricultural background and they see nothing alarm in it i personally feel the bill will bring increased profit for farmer but agricultural labourer may not be directly benefit from this hope farmer will increase the payment for them once their own income increase but let u get prepared to pay much more for farm product now onwards

take a side be very difficult in this case because i feel the bill be neither too right nor too wrong just the timing be wrong before complete capitalism complete socialism be important so that farmer can be unite and their produce can be sell collectively after complete socialisation the government can gradually sell out the share of the entity to a private owner or many owner i think this will help the government as well a the farmer and help to reduce loophole

so the new law allow direct to consumer model that cut out the middleman how be that bad entire world be move to that model if give an option i would buy directly from a farmer middleman should be optional i get the logistics of selling can be overwhelm for small farmer but they can always form small group or use middleman if they prefer to do so supply chain portion might be a challenging at first but be not impossible to figure out this way a farmer become their own bos
i hope the silent farmer who have benefit from this law for last one year will raise their voice atleast now
farmer ask to completely repeal the 3 farm law despite the govt agree to most of their objection be make this entire protest a politically motivate the farmer behaviour be make them a part of the problem now and not them a part of the solution

but it be must need to understand why only haryana and punjab when there be 2 cr farmer in uttar pradesh and 10 lac only in punjab
great way of explanation but i have one doubt if msp legalise than consider if more farmer grow wheat and in market the surplus of wheat and consumer still have to buy it at high price govt ca not fix price price fix by market it self definitely govt need to control cartel and corporate interference
no doubt hr community ka apna mulak hona chahye bhai i be very very thankful to my allah that i be pakistani and i be muslim rajput belong from india kernal
but the reality of the government control mandi be that the poor farmer be usually force to sell at whatever price the broker cartel at the mandi decide msp usually come when government procure directly through the fci etc for perishable item like brinjal lemon etc he be force to sell because he can not take the produce back home
i do not understand the small farmer will be screw how do not have the logistics fund to get out of the state and sell the crop

respect shekhar gupta sir i be great admirer of your journalism and have be follow your work from the day of kaar seva when i be just a teen ager sir with due respect i beg to differ from you somehow when you say that bjp have lose this battle on the contrary my view be that if anything bjp have succeed in it be so far strategy of counter the anti farm law agitation and i find this answer in your statement of this episode i agree with you completely that his agitation be no more about farm law but now purely a politics and i have my doubt that political pundit who decide bjp be strategy would not have ponder on the point that give a leverage of 18 month halt period could affect their upcoming election in up and elsewere especially if we all know now that it be just politics about this agitation what i mean to say be that government know very well leader of this agitation will not accept the condition of 18 month postponement of implementation of law and they float this offer with utmost care keep all the outcome in view and by not accept the offer farmer leader have actually fall into the trap i also have an impression this strategy of bjp can even sow seed of disagreement among farmer leader though that be just a guess feel
i support farmer

unfortunately the medium do not pursue champion of the law from within the silent majority and give them airtime in equal measure mobilization of stake holder in this case farmer in city town across india albeit on weekend would have force protester politician oppose to these law to ratchet down their rhetoric and force the medium to present a counter narrative
then what be the meaning of have a democracy if you dont debate on such crucial bill 1991 india be way different from today remember private corporates can not handle the bumper production of indian farmer so in the end farmer have to sell it at a meagre price

earlier even i think that modi govt be a weak govt whom anyone can blackmail after i saw that it take no action in bengal and maharashtra and obviously this tikaits farzi andolan but i be wrong modi do thing very strategically he reach to the core and when have all card ready he strike and choke the neck from all side leave no escape rout for the wrong people

all politician talk and talk and only talk of help the farmer only to get vote but poor farmer get nothing because the system be such it only benefit the middleman but modiji do not only talk but bring the law to really help the farmer where they can now sell anywhere and to anybody now the middleman do not have the monopoly of buy the farm product jai modiji jai hind jai bharat if you agree with modiji be new act support the farmer please hit

i use to earlier appreciate the vast range of knowledge that abhijit have but of late the kind of comment he make be downright nonsense and without back it with any proof or data the discussion on the 3 farm law withdrawal be the case i want to mention it be very clear that modiji have take this decision with a totally different situation in mind a against political reason and without analyse this abhijit compare modiji with rahul say another rahul in the govt this be utter nonsense which will be prove very soon

issue 1 farmer might not get adequate demand for their produce at msp in local mandi 2 they do not have resource to transport produce over large distance 3 distress sale of product at low price at local mandi farmer
i be with farmer but whatever happen today it be shameful those who be behind this incident should be punish
i be so baffled that none of the news channel on tv talk about how the repeal of the law might be for his own benefit if this have be do by any other person they would have literally invade their home to ask these question and most importantly i have see multiple protest in my lifetime and never have i ever see the medium so blatantly against one god knkws where this be go
this medium be still protect modi ji

3 if any dispute between farmer and industry then farmer can not go to court only can go to sdm court be not this point break our fundamental right because a per constitution there be an independent judiciary system in india for it be citizen

farm law be not like by only panjab and up farmer and there be no agitation in other part of india except these two state i be from maharashtra and i know here how farmer be get benitfits of these law
thanks 4 help d farmer
accord to the prs legislative research the percentage of bill refer to parliamentary committee have fall from 60 and 71 in the 14th lok sabha 200409 and 15th lok sabha 200914 to 27 in the 16th lok sabha 201419 and an even low 12 in the current lok sabha since 2019 many important bill include the three farm law that be repeal recently do not get discuss in parliamentary committee
we be with modiji whatever it be
1 apmc exploit farmer which usually run by powerful middleman example farmer in maharashtra in 2019 get rs 8 kg for onion whereas the sp be rs 99 kg or how farmer only get rs 2 kg for onion in 2018 in ap and so many countless story farmer who have a contract with mcd for potato in india be do much good
farmer should get msp law pass dis be the right time modi will listen before election not after election
no farmer no food
be a farmer i know that most of farmer do not have store house so that they can store their agriculture produce and wait for good price of their agriculture produce in free market they have to sell their crop even if price be drastically low otherwise bad weather can destroy their 6 month be hard work and a lot of investment
the committee member be not farmer they be economist scientist etc who support the tycoon enter the agriculture market with money and technology now the farmer be depend on fertiliser pesticide when modern technology come agriculturist will have to depend for genetically modify seed also they have to buy at price fix by these company modern machinaries will come which the small farmer can not afford they have to sell their land and become menial worker in the city lose their divinity and we consumer have to eat all dangerous grain which will affect our health thecpharma company hospital and stick market will be happy
i support farm these picture cnt give judgement to whole protest tum 2crore se zuyada kisan ko bura nhi bol sakte
congratulation farmer
this show the weakness of modi first of all there be no need for such law all the govt have to do be to remove any restriction the farmer might have in sell their product no new law be need the middleman who control trade aid by khalistanis abroad use it to defame modi and to test his will they succeed now they will try to bring him to new low and they might succeed in that also
i would also question the premise that the amendment to farm produce trade and commerce bill will result in minimal benefit to small farmer who anyways sell outside of ampc already and do not have the mean to sell to different state this be a fairly conservative view base on current state of technology and business model this can change immensely with change to technology and if private player get into distribution and e commerce style of operation of agricultural product a good number of low income small farmer do have access to internet and mobile already
will the dk dmk admk congress and communist now take responsibility for the disgrace of today be india and take appropriate action
nope india need to move move away from a controlled economy to a supply and demand economy farmer suffer everywhere due to climate uncertainty economic growth and government policy so they need to become market aware and produce good people want to buy at a quality and price they can afford they need to take the tiger by tail and control it
the farmer a very intelligent when it come to their interest and voting time will prove it again the state where these these law get implement will flourish
now you understand it be not about the farmer it be about the election
govt bill policy and sarkari yojna mane prokolpo guli niye video upload korle valo hoy i hope i shall get to see the expected video bro thanks
the failure here be of the government much more so than the farmer

apmc can be use a benchmark for set msp a a minimum procurement price for the commodity

this be a bad decision to repeal imo because it provide more freedom and opportunity to farmer but i hope in future the government have some good plan for them and have good communication skill whilst introduce the bill
good job modiji do your work in other field
great analysis on farmer protest salute to your courage
one of the most unbiased video i watch on farm bill

congratulation to farmer solidarity against modi and bjp next freedom for kashmir and khalistan
if the second scenario be the case than it will send a false message about the actual market because good price to the farmer mean good demand in market which will inturn attract more people to do farm and than government have to spend even more to procure these product and because of demand and supply disbalance the procured product will just rot in the storage bin i e rot of our tax money
this be not only a farmer protest it a bloody politics
farmer for the time be cultivate for you and your family only
just to oppose narendra modi india lose a important agriculture reform all economic farm like imf also say these law be important

some economist say that only 6 of the farmer benefit from the msp what they hide be the fact that these 6 farmer produce 90 of the foodgrains this be a figure that date back to 2013 the situation today be very different and a more realistic recent data be that about 35 farmer have start use the msp facility in any case these figure have many caveat and error one can keep digging and soon begin to see a maze of question and puzzle but the question be how these figure of 6 or 35 justify into the decision of scrap the msp
my goodness such huge mammoth respect farmer
it be very strange why reporter ask question with farmer why they do not ask question with government or minister bjp why only opposite party farmer be
many people in my family be farmer but they be not out there protest they be in the field farm and these bastard who call themselves farmer be not they the same farmer who do the same with policeman at red fort they deserve this
it be indeed sad that the kisan be do not come for a discussion when govt call the opposition too ditch the nation for their own benefit it be so unfortunate that the decision to repeal the farmer bill be decide on road and not in parliament be this what you call a a democracy then why election let be discuss on road just imagine what will happen to this nation if everyone sit on road block each other progress this be totally unconstitutional and undemocratic
i want to tell you that no big medium show you that farmer be sit there for more than two month peacefully
uncle ji tussi sikh a isliye be respect bt sorry do not stand for d right of ppl which right bjp be give to ppl frm 6yrs n stil u r with thm aur farmer pe lathi charge k baad b aap bolre ho will sit discuss ab hum alag nai hongay cz lathi aapko nai paddi aur seat pyaari hai sikh ka naam kharab na karre uncle sikhi definitely ye nai sikhati

msp be give only on wheat and paddy because government buy it while the other crop be buy by private buyer at even less than half of msp government should try and focus on that so farmer move from one crop to other
five sardars massacre by uncivilized terrorist in kashmir let italian congress team to visit their family and protest against the killer and pakistan if at all they have any concern for the country
rakesh ji my brother farmer community get together united again now student also need a leader like you to fight for their right
you talk about msp let me tell you a scenario of sale of maize this season the msp of maize be 1850rs per quintal so farmer should be able to sell their produce at 1850rs but no they be not able to do so and sell at around 800 1000rs per quintal because no one buy at msp

good law bad deployment sad show slam law down someone throat doesnt make it real consensus building through democratic mean involve all relevant stake holder while can be slow and painful be the right strategy for india people clamor for muscle up strategy on any issue over consensus building approach should know india be too fragmented and diverse in it view point to be strong arm into one this would have be the best time for bjp to use it cadre to do drive relate to benefit of these law rather than employ rhetoric nevertheless the last part of what pm say give me hope all party committe while could set u back by sometime should atleast get u some part of these law back if not all to the nay sayers of these law i want to say one thing market economics be the only reason why this country have develop in the last 30 year to move against that would mean agriculture would continue to slip a a percentage of gdp we dont want to be a food import nation again lets be together and do what it take to revive this sector

the underlie problem that presenter highlight in most of the drawback be apprehension that govt would abandon and cease to exist a a player hence lead to exploitation by private entity but the government have assure that it would not cease to exist a a player and include strong provision to protect the farmer in various situation far if market force resort to such behavior govt have tool and capability to further enact the law to protect farmer interest but base on this apprehension alone be it fair to disallow the private player who could reduce inefficiency in the system and portray successful co operative movement like amul and others plus we have example where govt continue to exist a a player alongwith private entity airline power oil telecom bank etc
farming be prevalent in other state of india also but why only punjab farmer be present at the protest predominantly and be all people present actually farmer there be a huge political agenda behind the protest do not be fool by mainstream medium be smart read the actual document read data analyse and then draw conclusion

why in progressive state like maharashtra the farmer r not part of agitation
2 20 i would like to point out that the govt will not need to take out the apmc brick by brick sir the issue here be that the corporates have a certain financial backing with which they can provide a price slightly hire than apmc for a couple of year 3 4 year let assume farmer will therefore sell to these corporates at high price and no procurement will occur through mandis this will effectively drain the mandis of the mandi tax and mandis will eventually fall into ruin by themselves in the 5th year when the corporate silo will be already full due to excess procurement in the previous year farm production of wheat paddy have always be great than consumption for many year now the corporates may choose not to buy at all or buy at very low price and the option of mandis at that point in time may not be available at all i hope this get the point across
i think these all so call farmer be leader be traitors the central government should take very strict action against these low life traitor

this farm bill would have work if first govt of india would have provide some way so that farmer can have a warehouse where they can store the crop till it sell at a profitable price far if it a law that a msp have to be give then they would feel more secure sure the crop in india be not of very high quality but that do not mean that government would put such a pressure on farmer who be already live in distress

one argument against the msp be that it cause an imbalance in the cropping pattern because it incentivises the farmer into grow the crop that offer them good return this argument be a classic case of put the horse before the cart see it like this punjab be not a land suit for rice and yet this be happen because there be no msp on the crop that it can handle good if the government declare and enforce msp on every crop then punjab and haryana be more likely to shift to oilseed and other cash crop infact declare an msp be the only way of ensure a balanced cropping pattern

jab tak congress party rahega aatank wadi kam nehi hoga
i think that the bill have two flaw 1 the removal of msp outside apmc market which be bad 2 the non interference of the government in sale of agricultural commodity outside apmc i e in private market there could have be strict law accord to how private company can enrich the farmer rather than impoverish them for their own profit making purpose for company charge less than msp there can be strict tax law or penalty for them
these farm law be not there for last 50 year but farmer suicide be there there be no correlation between these two thing i dont know why people think that if these law be take back thing will be good

it be really unfortunate that 3 farm bill have be take back it be failure on part of government that it could not understand the benefit of the bill
bjp be call them aandolan jivi khalistani etc thn why repeal farm law now
please form a political party with name kisan mazdoor party india and participate in mp election and also in different state assembly election like punjab 2022 and haryana be your own bos rather than look towards corrupt traditional party if aam admi party can form govt in delhi then why can not you after independence this be first time so many people from different state gather under one umbrella so try to avail this golden opportunity if kisan can manage this dehli morcha peacefully and properly why can not they run a country

they act like hynas and hunt this lion hearted sikh farmer
leave the farmer at the mercy of the market be like hand them over a death sentence
therefore the govt reach a spot of no return and with the election in 22 it might have think that the withdrawal of the three farm law would be a good face save one than do so after defeat in the election

legalise msp which be calculate base on surplus tally be the right thing to be do for the farmer
farmer those who be in support for this law should come and protest
2019 bank scam reach a record of 77000 crore and rule party bjp have no idea what happen and medium do not say a small information about it what modi do be for rich people

but the some people who hat modi and the khalistanis who take over the andolan
the only channel which present a neutral view on the farm law i do not support bjp but i still support the farm law after understand the economics behind it
farm reform must be form by only those people who be involve in this business start from the manufacturer transporter stockist warehouse distributor and price regulator other people be incapable of do it

the lallantop you really do an appreciable act to show to grind situation of hardness and sacrifice of kishan this will lead a great impact to feel the pain of farmer in everyone heart supportsfarmers savemotherland
how about limit the number of farmer crop the same crop and or limit area of crop for each crop example limit sugar cane crop to 1 million acre and divide that by the number of farmer do that crop then they can crop something else if they have extra land leave
if the farmer can sell this milk directly to customer with private transportation it can help them gain more money
farmer should be give freedom to protest smoothly
finally the arrogant government be force to bow down in front of farmer jai hind
one can see where india be head everyone must support each other and fight against modi supporter otherwise they will ruin the country

not happy with the govt outrightly repeal the law it should have be amend if flaw be there it may act a catalyst for other protest across country so what will be the govts action for other similar protest then we have to see highly disappointed with the govt repeal the law under pressure where the protestors have cause mayhem and ruckus in and around delhi i do not know why there be no protest around other place in country except delhi and ncr be not farmer everywhere in country or govt be bend it be way for those who can afford to protest in and around delhi and not care for other place farmer
but all the bjp it cell or medium only show a farmer who have a stone in his hand nd call him dangae

it escape me when sg say new law be ground breaking and farmer friendly too basically these be not to be call new at all these be simple repealment of apmc apmc be create to help farmer get fair treatment in sell their produce it may have fail miserably in ensure msp for non governmental purchase in which case the new law should be to strengthen where the current system fail

vice team it be good to see young people take initiative overall a good report on your next report please spend more time on what be wrong with the law point by point most independent economist include at least one at the world bank say these new law will decrease income of family farmer and increase food price for the consumer they be very cleverly write to concentrate more wealth into the hand of ambani adani be of india it be not capitalism it be cronyism we have already see in the state of bihar where these law be implement at the state level farm revenue have be cut in half imagine when this be implement across all of india over the next decade and competition be obliterate the current system be not perfect but that be not an excuse to take wealth from the middle class and redistribute to the 0 000001 yes that be a real number 17 billionaire in india worth over 5b 1 353 000 000 population for many of these 17 though not all most of their wealth come from massive transfer of indian taxpayer fund through corrupt contract and transfer of indian tax payer own asset for penny on the dollar it do not come from innovation or great business acumen in fact they be stifle innovation and gdp growth china not exactly a model of capitalism or great governance be grow at almost twice the gdp rate when their economy be at 3t these ambani adani type could teach class to the russian oligarch on corruption now they have set their eye on the indian farmer unfortunately for them farmer may have allot less money because it be honest money but they be smart and more resourceful than these so call business tycoon
what the indian farmer need be not unguided freedom what he need be help both financial and technological

one thing be clear farmer youth poor middle class asha worker contract govt employee teacher etc will change the govt
i think this press conference be to change the name of farmer
personally i support the new farm law but i dont get why people be make such a big issue over a flag seem a bit childish to me ive see many people favour hindu rahstra flag over india flag but i dont care because most of the people who do this be innocent and not that educate you guy shouldnt take it so seriously
the demand of the farmer be very reasonable the government should accede to their demand without further delay
if you be not ready to accept the change change will change you it go for both the government as well a farmer
i think it bite difficult for example my family be from bihar which be one of the poor state in india these new farm law can literally make our annual income from crop twice like right now my family be cultivate cauliflower and if these farm law be in place we would earn almost 5 6 time on this crop itself but if u r a rich farmer or from a rich state like punjab or haryana then yeah these law can decrease ur income and security quite a lot in simpler term these law giver poor state more opportunity and money and all that money and opportunity be be take from rich state like punjab and harayan thats why farmer of these state be they only one protest it in a way it kinda like socialism
sir 700 people die his party netas call farmer a terrorist and jihadist modi didnt even give a single speech sadly state it like amarawathi farmer farmer all over should start a walk to each and every state and publish about rest of law loss cause to farmer by it and fight till each and every farm bill be repealed farmer should be support by each and every state government and help them acehive it

another thing most of the small farmer be already be exploit by the big farmer since these big farmer be buy crop at a price lower than the msp the point of this law be to provide a path for the small farmer to sell their crop directly to the wholesaler which would guarantee them a good price than if they have sell it to these big farmer it be about give the small farmer more agency over the price that they receive for their crop this be a two way argument you can not talk about one side and ignore the other

i think a per the apmc law the buyer have to pay the tax ce mandi fee not the farmer the information give in this video seem to be incorrect because the non apmc mandi will not have any tax or commision the buyer can pay more to the farmer even after retain his share of profit thats why the farmer may get good price in the non apmc mandis the apprehension be that after few year because of less transaction happen through the apmc the infrastructure will become unoperational and then the private buyer will start to squeeze the farmer but a i say it an apprehension

sir i be a great fan of cut the clutter and follow avidly your analysis of international geopolitics however your analysis of the agricultural economy in the context of the ongoing farmer protest leave me unconvinced in my perhaps simplistic view the imbalance in agricultural production rice and wheat versus oilseed for example can be correct simply by rebalancing the procurement price the disservice to farmer in bihar due to low price availability of foodgrain procure in punjab and haryana seem to be a matter of the bihar have abolish the apmc act and not give it farmer the incentive available to farmer in punjab and haryana why can not the government simply increase the procurement price for oilseed maize etc and reduce them proportionately for rice and wheat why do we need a new law and open door for ambanis and adanis into agriculture why can not fci simply export excess foodgrain rather than allow them to rot in open storage why must we allow ambani adani crony capitalism into agriculture when absence of big business do not prevent u from get out of the cycle of famine and become self sufficient in food do not get answer to these question from this episode the clutter be not cut
problem be only 2 state be follow the msp properly so the farmer over there have the problem but they still have the option to continue with the same just the farmer who do not want to sell in maandi they can move out and find other option
if each and every party be protest against one party then bjp be 1000 right

i have listen to various opinion on this topic the farmer bill be put forward with the best intention however the external force fund this protest be extremely strong most important reason why a pm would go on the backfoot 1 meeting with capt amrinder in oct where he submit a report and there be a cross verification do on his claim regard the increase in anti india activity in punjab 2 supreme court have put a stay order since jan 2021 and the recommendation put forward by the panel no action have be take so honestly the bill have be dead for long 3 i dont think that the pm would withdraw something becoz of up or punjab election with or without the farm bill vaapase bjp still have a strong hold in up bjp will never win anything in punjab anyways 4 bjp leadership must be acutely aware that repeal one bill would bring other issue to be challenge as well like caa i would like to understand this good in the coming day no matter what i will still support modi n yogi unless someone can show me a good leader that him do not ever dare to bring mamta or kejri that will be the end of swatantra bharat

however you discuss only flaw of various apmc act and exist practice not how new bill will resolve these issue except few you do not discuss about new bill for agreement between farmer and sponsor how the dispute among them will be resolve what will be the power of court in this regard what if sdm be unbiased or his decision otherwise prejudice to farmer what if produce will not match quality grade standard criteria inspection will be do by sponsor and they can reject the price can be vary and corporates be smart than innocent farmer and they may take undue advantage of section 5 bargain power of big corporates may induce individual farmer to sell their produce at low price no other central law prohibit it corporates can now stock huge in their cold storage and sell later at high price
a simple solution to solve the problem for grain storage would be that farmer can form their own regional cooperative like amul it will reduce the financial burden on the government and at the same time empower the farmer the concept of msp on all crop be not feasible it will increase the fiscal burden on the government

actually the three farm law be to kill small farmer anyone can buy the crop without proper system because of mass production of crop private buyer would not give good price and if any one be not pay after buy the crop farmer could not go court they can only go to district officer but due to corruption district officer would not listen to farmer farmer dont have storage system in india due to which they can not regulate market the market would be regulate by big corporation and they would decide the sell and buy price hundred of farmer die at protest but govt do nothing it be not democracy not bjp be do it only for vote the farm law be just for business and corporation they would have crush the middle snd small farmer in india 70 of people be dependent on farm but the government do understand government tell that they be not farmer they be terrorist be it good for a prime minister to say these word for farmer and see now how he change his view he be the bad pm
sir what about the mandi tax which a license trader have to pay in an apmc wont neo liberalism attract more private trader beacuse they wont have to pay this tax in an apmc thus cater towards the downfall of apmcs so now farmer will still have the msp but there chance of sell at a profit at apmc will reduce but before these ordinance they have a safety net of msp while also a chance of make good profit now because private trader will move out farmer can not be certain of get that msp i just have a this small doubt

a for the central government perception this act may root out all the concern of the indian farmer and i wish good luck but my concern be on the execution strength of the government especially central government because the reform take by the modi government be become curse to the people of india in every aspect for example the note ban take by the government become grave to the small scale industry even after completion of 4 year the bad impact of that decision be not come down due to that decision the unemployment rate reach to mountain level in our country the same thing in the matter of gst also our constitution always take about decentralisation of everything but due to gst in the financial matter the central government become iron hand and now the state become minority share holder in the financial spectram of our country the same thing happen in lockdown issue also we be all feel to be shame after watch such painful visuals of migrant people here my question and concern be that whether central government creat any platform to perform this act without mistkes if this act become one more failure act india will witness very painful situvation before make these kind of law the center go to one piolet project in particular state and find out the result and make any correction which be need to implement all over country with out have any ground work they think to implement be never be good because the strength of this government be not up to mark in implementing of these kind of act most of indian face bitter experience due to act of this central government
i m concern that medium and these liberal be drag india back to the dark time of congress rule it sad to see indian will never become like united state or west where they embrace meritocracy capitalism and low corruption look like india be go back to congress rule and back to the 2000s era policy and politics of dynasty rule and nepotism thank you medium and delusional liberal thank you

big problem in india be illiteracy people really do not understand what they be protest for in a plain english this bill take out middle man and now farmer can sell their product directly end consumer which earn them more money still they be protest it be nothing but utter stupidity this be my observation modi government will do everything to help people if they can understand
any legislation to be introduce in parliament after consultation with the stake holder in this case farmer be not consult and didnot take farmer into confidence any concern s from stake holder must be take into consultation before draft the legislation which be not do in this case which be wrong in democracy this be not a radical reform but a high handedness of modi govt
there be no question on the need for law to get rid of unscrupulous middleman between farmer and consumer how do take away mandis go to help mandis be set up to prevent exploitation of farmer in the first place how come it become breed ground for middle man
modi be a politician at the end of day he think of do something in his capacity for the farmer and vast majority be happy with it but if a vocal minority of rich powerful vested interest group with strong pr be dent his image worldwide why would he care about farmer but when the silent majority actually realize what they lose it will be too late they miss a golden opportunity if they be so naive to comprehend who their friend be and who be their foe they be well off be leave to their fate modi will find a way to win election but the
so do not compare these farmer to american
2 who will give monetary help to farmer relative nearest and dear who die in this period

once in your life you need a doctor a lawyer a policeman and a preacher but every day three time a day you need a farmer support and respect farmer
but we need to educate the farmer with this law
farmer can not do such thing
my theory be that the bjp govt strategy be to stretch the protest as long a it can so that public will feel the brunt of the protest and revolt against the protestors instead of the govt
first destroy godi medium everything will become normal
it great sorrow that no one care for the poor people who fee them farmer be protest for their right which they deserve the government be play with them
they be not true farmer they be very rich and prosperous farmer get msp but marginal and small land holder be happy
i have just watch vinod dua sir video about the farmer protest and he underline the fact that farmer be blame pm for not react on their demand so do you think his teflon image be tarnish a bit

welcome modi ji
modi govt should take this farm bill soon
2 lack of crop diversity and support industry india be a surplus producer of stuff like rice and wheat we just produce too much of it while we end up import some other major crop like pulse now it be somewhat of a side effect i can say a government give msp guarantee on rice and wheat in a lot instance which make it artificially more profitable to grow than other crop even though it should have be the other way round where price on rice and wheat should have go down if supply be too high and discourage farmer to grow them and grow something where there be demand for or else it be just a waste of food money soil and effort now i do know the issue with this a farmer fear leave a stable and safe source for something where they end up make less so i feel government should introduce some sort of a float msp system where msp will be set accord to demand and supply
why be so many farmer against this i think cut out the middleman mean the farmer would have be pay more
we proud farmer
600 million farmer protest be like some number come to your mind and you just say it in the flow
farmer be almost half of all worker have a lot of power just as long a they can hold out until their demand be discuss and hopefully meet
i hope people also come forward in support of farmer to reject this policy
and they can also buy from farmer directly more price then this msp and why they need the law for this or stand parllel mandi
during bihar election campaign where be the social distance and rule i feel very sad for farmer

thank you for support farmer
i know farmer be concern but instead of demand to repeal the whole act but specific amendment should be carry out which be deny by farm leader therefore farm leader need to be more sensitive to this issue
time will answer that this revoke have deep reasoning and the true loser would be the farmer who would either live a peasent life under mandi trader like tikait or hang to the tree like always
proud of our farmer hope they win their righteous fight
who ever put that flag there have definitely manage to turn a lot of people against the farmer you should have protest peacefully and should have respect our tri colour flag the indian flag represent unity it show that india be country where people of different caste religion and ethnicity can live peacefully

do farmer really watch parliamentary debate do any meaningful discussion ever happen during parliamentary debate the opposition would not have agree even if there be lengthy discussion in the end it would have come to a vote in parliament on the law and the majority would get their way also by your logic government should consult everyone on income tax defence relate law this way we will never be able to pass any law one should either believe in democracy or not once a government be choose by majority one must allow them to operate rather than blockade city
great analysis so you prove that apmc be not work because of it flaw and farmer be mostly sell their produce outside the mandis below msp in cash transaction the new act will mess up the income of the state government thus hamper the development
one of the big issue point out by farmer be the fact that the bill exclude a price guarantee mechanism like msp

6 01 tear gas be use when the mob have start to break the barricade and march on non permit around 8 30am to 9 00 be rakesh tikait have admit on camera that protestors want to start the march early but the police stop them so they break the barricade so in my opinion police be decision of lathi charge and use tear gas be totally justified
meanwhile indian sellout godi medium be like why be the opposition mislead the farmer against supreme commander modi
or 2 those 96 poor farmer who can not afford to sell their product even in their neighbour district
this should have be do sooner but it be probably easy to do so now since taliban be show it card airstrikes be important now against taliban
modi government take this decision due to election but there be possibility that this will backfire and increase the problem for bjp let be hope for good
sorry for ask but would not this situation be resolve if the government just introduce new minimum price law for the produce of the farmer and enforce them that way the three farm law would be acceptable the system would rid off middleman and both the farmer and the government would get what they want again apology for my naivete regard the issue just want to understand the situation well
most anti poor and anti farmer prime minister india ever have and would never have
farming be very different from other industry a every crop be harvest in a short span of time every year this create a large gap between demand and suppy hence make it a free market be a curse on everyone thanks that some wisdom prevail and farmer be save from the ruthless hand of corporates the need of the hour be that we work together to bring crop diversity and to motivate farmer to grow crop which be import this will make u self reliant and decrease import
i feel that this reformed agriculture bill propose by gov need some change amendment to ensure that our most diligent hardworking farmer brother get their truly deserving reward

shekhar gupta casually compare alaudin khilji be price control to msp while at the same breath explain how it be the maximum price set for soldier not minimum this approach lack intellectual rigour you can draw baseless comparison of every economic and social policy with some practice that occur century ago most of indian law policy and act be base on something or the other introduce by the british this do not necessarily undermine the contemporary relevance of any law or act nor do it make it particularly special what shekhar gupta should question be why be the centre adamant on implement these act even when the state have show that they can easily reform it to suit their own situation which he seem to be use a his primary argument
salute to every farmer who be sit there nation will remember all of you a true nation saviour
very bad decision by modi ji to repel this farm law i be stun by the weakness show to reward such blackmail by such few middleman and khalisthanis to decide the fate of majority of the farmer and indian industry this decision will pave way for more such blackmail at every step of this govt i just hope and pray that this may not prove in future to be write in the annual of history a a historic blunder by bjp it be a senseless harakiri and cowardice show at the time when battle be turn decisively in your favor today i feel sad and i feel like it the victory of bad over good today be not a good day for the nation bjp and modiji need to course correct a they have invite more trouble now everyday they will hole for ransom by few hundred crook

you know the irony vice use to tell u about the law that be cause distress in their other series but over here they have not even make a single explanation i have read the 3 new law that be root of problem for them the only problem that exist be that they can not get the supply and demand of market in right coherence so that farmer can sell their grain in a set time before it go rip and this be the only fault with the law also what i think cause this protest be not actually actually a family farmer take charge but business official retailer who usually buy from farmer at low price and sell u make product much high rate cause if this law pass farmer can sell their crop anywhere and to anyone as long a it be record by indian government this cause the great protest they do not want money transparency and also i be not a bjp it cell just a indian guy who think it well we sort this in our own country cause every family respect farmer and this age of misinformation just upset and destroy rational thinking
the ground report fail the moment you call them farmer

go by your own logic india should also should declare itself a hindu nation and verbally mention we will take care of all minority like taliban pakistan and bangladesh we all know then how do they take care why leftist eye have close their eye on what happen to minority in this country although they be part of india at some point the only difference between india and these country be that islam be in majority in these nation if indian muslim really celebrate taliban victory do you think their thought process be any different why do not you blame their dharmik chashma because your chashma do not see it
you both dilute the anger of farmer and show in a way that government be a neutral force you focus on bill explanation but loophole be not give full focus rather than say do not take farmer view before see this video you use politucal view good try to divert
no farmer no food son of farmer

but what be wrong with farmer law
it be an eye opener for everybody to know exactly about farm bill my advise be to translate it in all indian language for every indian non english speak mass to understand the subject and than agitate against the negative point for amendment if any instead of blindly coerce the government for withdrawal and hold delhiites to ransom
central bjp govt have make life of every indian miserable have not see one ache din in the last 6 year god please save india
this bjp spokesperson anchor be to junior front of rakesh tikat ji
ap farmer support this protest but it very far to reach and difficult to live in that cold weather they be not use to cold weather due to geographical difference location language be another barrier they have never enter delhi far to reach capital
farmer protest be right because if trading start outside mandi then minimum support price msp will be not there and initially they will get high price but the mandi will collapse soon and after mandi collapse since there be no msp the farmer exploitation will start and big company trader will purchase in very low cost outside mandi without tax and legal support pressure
be it a wise decision of modi government whatever law he be bring to this country but there be casualty innocent life be lose wealth of the ordinary people be lose unrest everywhere why why bcoz he be unfit for the job and if bhakts want him please build a temple and worship him we the common people of india have no objection let a man with heart become the pm of this country one may be proud of 56 chest but that be empty there be no heart of the size of an ant
shame on these govt official a d politician they will also go home and eat food create by farmer inhumane
why akali dal support bjp for pass the bill
modi chore baste we will see congress will come
and the farmer can not lose their land a under the new law the land of the farmer can neither be sell lease or use for any purpose other than those relate to agricultural trade activity
farmer have be heavily exploit over there for a long time even on the certain paper test this cold truth s use a the material which indicate pesticide and seed be so expensive and they can only afford them by borrow money from company who sell pesticide and seed
never think a megalomaniac like modi will repeal the law but really glad he finally do reform be require but you have to consult and work with the farmer

jindabadfarmers be the real hero of our country proud of you
the real problem be even big than just take back these new farm law the main thing already exist a say here large amount of trade between farmer and trader across the country do not ensure minimum support price thus put the farmer in never end debt lead to thousand of suicide every year govt need to ensure this too
i think this be great for indian democracy i be not an expert on the farm law but i leave it to the expert i be only examine the functioning of democracy in india imagine since bjp take over for every thing they pass an ordinance which mean they do not want any discussion at all second the president be sign every thing and never on a single occasion question why the urgency for the ordinance and the way parliament session be conduct be even bad the speaker chairman do not bring any bill for discussion until last minute and then pass them through voice vote even the way finance budget be present last year be horrible the fm do not give any detail and asks to refer to the budget addendum for every thing that will be share after the session and after the session it be all crap with no data definitely the current government do not want to take question and accountability democracy be fail in india and if that continue we will end up the way like china
main reason for take back these law be inability to convince benefit to real farmer or we can say lousy attitude of real farmer to let these bogus agitator represent them
still this decision have more advantage and the disadvantage be mostly base on imagination that it can happen or what if this happen for now it will be profitable for farmer
shame on modi government this government be take india 40 year back
our prime minister can not bow down he do not have any modesty or courage he bring the three law without consult the farmer and take them out without consult them whats the point well the point be it have be do keep the punjab election in mind he want to make amrinder singh look strong modi do nothing for the good for the nation everything he do be political
i just want to say dhruv rathee u r do a great work bro but this be all planned way year a ago i be tell all the people untill and unless whole indian people dont protest and boycott bjp till then u cant stop this party

hindu be under threat in india even after bjp government
5th now govt have agree to give choice to state to levy tax outside mandis also though not levy tax on agri produce be in favour of farmer and consumer because there be also 4 gst which be share by centre and state on food stuff and be ultimately pay by consumer
just one thing have protest solve amything when there be a dialogue go on i check in some other channel many farmer be happy because they can sell it to any people they wantti centre be call for dialogue then they be suppose to meet on dec 3 so could not they wait till then i heard that farmer in many place that farmer especially in punjab be very rich they be use to take all benefit from the government now if that be true be this a political gimmick by opposition belief i a a citizen want farmer to get their die i would rather pay the farmer than the shop keep why not make the payment in such a way that once pay most of it go to farmer modi have bring on many change i have full trust that he will come up with something the farmer can protest quietly let them wait till 3 rd also they have no right to damage property that have people tax if any thing damage farmer too must pay the bill
people of nation will demand repeal all the constutional bill law from the date of constitution from 1950 to till date along with the kisan bill krishi law

why people be say annadhata these people be domestic terrorist support political party and also want to be in politics
but farmer be not receive their share
but we have time to comment on farmer
moral of the story evms can only bring you to form a government but they dont give you power over people unless the people really vote for you as far a bjp be concern whenever modi be go bjp be finish and if the evm truth come out before that then then bjp will be ban and modi be in jail r will have to form a new party
lesson to be learnt farmer movement and the caste base reservation be the two topic which any government should never mess up with if the bjp government want to consolidate it be vote share then make their stand clear on the msps and implement it
log kishano ko bharma rahe hai this bill be only for farmer be welfare
thanks to your channel atleast to realise a certain community of our great india who be in minority say they be comfortable with indian law and order and stay very comfortable this be a true indian medium hat off to you

so far majority bjp leader or supporter who appear on various medium outlet be all lie tow the same line of lie regard this case the victim and their family deserve justice the minister his son and accomplice cook up various story to wash their hand but no one be buy their story the minister should be force to resign and action should be take against the police for delay tactic bjp leader defend and people involve in this crime should come and do this crime in europe and see what happen
bjp rss government play politics over 700 shaheed farmer and their family for whom modi government be the government which destroy their life this could have be do so much sooner and save hundred of farmer
modi ji agriculture income ko income tax ke daayre mein laakar a a taxable income treat hona chahiye ye maang hmari taraf se hei
farmer protest ki piche desh birodhi agenda hai congress and aap etc party ki saf saf nazar ara hai
similarly msp minimum support price mean even if the quality of crop turn out to be low farmer can atleast recover the cost on other hand where the quality be well bid to procure good quality start from msp let the farmer decide at what price above msp he be willing to sell
all citizen must read 3 agricultural law totally anti farmer law benefit corporates 1 no provision for farmer to go to court incase of dispute with private contractor buyer be 2 farmer can not fix price on produce no guarantee on purchase price
i stand against what medium like republic aaj tak be do but the farm law be good
nobody in india include the central govt explain clearly these farm law how good or bad it be which be why expert say it will all be know when implement for 2 year it could go either way it be implement in bihar in the past with disastrous result

3 4 bjp worker have also die india be best biased channel
regard msp we can not compare any electronic or other good wth agricultural product since dayby day it will perish and who will buy any spoiled or perished thing the rice even produce frm a single land will not be of same quality so if there be hundred kg seventy will get good price and for the remain price will be low some time at the time of harvest rain may come or lot of problem which can affect the quality and price more than that since india be a member of wto corporates have a choice to buy low cost food crop frm other country and central govt be spend billion of rupee every year in the agriculture sector through various subsidy and scheme and in the newspaper we can check the price of crop daily pls check

and no government have even able to significantly create job where the farming community can be wean out of farm which be become more more poorer a 86 5 of the farmer have less than 1 5 acre of land and this holding be continuously reduce you can see the exodus of farmer abroad from punjab where this be a major reason although some big farmer also emigrate due to the quality of life abroad however majority emigrate a farming be not viable and there be no suitable white collar job available elsewhere

the law on paper be by and large good with a few exception like not mention msp on paper or no access to court but the benefit of this level of privatisation be usually limit to those who be already well establish and have the capacity to take advantage of the benefit poor farmer may not be able to do so give the high level of poverty in the country especially in rural area we can not completely do away with government support

1 scale accord to a report almost 87 of farmer in india be small and marginalised farmer who work on less than 2 hectare of land it mean small farmer because of their scale have to buy the input like seed fertiliser etc at retail price small scale lead to high cost of transportation proportion to crop these farmer mostly do not have the mean to store them to themselves so they mostly have to sell them immediately in the market and consider the transportation they mostly have to sell them at their village itself and also consider almost all other farmer in the village might be do to same thing so it basically flood the market and well demand and supply come into play make them receive less income and on top of that less bargaining power lead to easier exploitation of them by the middle man now mandi system make the last part of sell a bit more safe with government oversight to make sure at least they get somewhat of a fair price but again it do not solve the entire issue
no farmer protest so
there be too many people here who have forget that our enemy be pakistan china and khalistanis whether the farm law be good or not be secondary what matter more be that we be well equip to deal with the external threat we be face with call sikh farmer carry the indian flag khalistanis and drive car on them be not just reprehensible but dangerous to the country think about how you be demoralize the sikh soldier who have guard our border for century your lack of respect and gratitude be bizarre and shameful please change your way and stop fight with fellow indian this be just not the time

what the agitate farmer could not achieve by their prolonged agitation could be do by capt amarinder singh i think it be largely the effort of the captain couple with election politics which lead the central govt to reconsider the issue to pave the way for captain be victory in punjab election no political party however can claim a role in this issue enough hint be already drop by him in advance about the course the central govt need to take but how a small fraction of farmer have become a block to large section

around 70 of the rural india depend primarily on agriculture for their livelihood of which 80 of farmer be small and marginal
really appreciate your way of present all the bill but i would like to point out that gradual weakening of apmcs can hurt the local economy so i would suggest the govt to strengthen the apmcs and then look towards the private enterprise to deal with our farmer so that farmer can have the best of option and let them decide that to whom do they want to sell their produce to apart from that ensure a minimum support price even for the corporates will be a welcome step
danga gang congress party and his all supporter party
the way samdish be coverage work be that it make you sympathise with the farmer we know why farmer want full repeal of law but what samdish be not cover be why the govt be adamant on bring these law maybe no one from the govt be ready to explain him the need of these law modi government do a pretty bad job the way it pass these law with nearly no support from other political party farmer their leader and the farmer union wish this issue resolve with farmer go back home happy

whats really go to happen be now the market will decide what should our farmer cultivate eventually that will be in the favour of middle class people out there hoard will be carry out by the buyer of farmer produce due to the relaxation in eca the farmer will struggle to battle the legal issue with such buyer after few year farmer will be exploit by the farmer produce buyer and they will become new middle men in india also the price of the produce will rise due to unrestricted hoarding by the buyer at last the farmer be go to struggle again individual farmer do not have bargain power if we be support cooperative farm the same amendment may result in more benefit than this

bjp always lick feets of sikh but sikh do not vote bjp in general election or delhi election
i personally have just one issue with this analysis which be to treat the word farmer a a homogeneous group i believe all analysis on farmer issue will become much more nuanced once we start categorise different type of farmer base on their landholding mechanisation labour employ etc the status quo definitely benefit some stakeholder otherwise it would not have exist and any reform will hurt this category at the end of the day if the reform hurt the rich category of farmer marginally in the short run while increase the option for the most marginal category of farmer then it come down to who do you support in this scenario
nice video with so much information just for my clarity that if msp play a very crucial role then why currently only 6 of farmer be take benefit of this why long time back people do not oppose bring msp not a guideline but a law can you guide me

if we ask any big corporate to make a deal with another big corporate they can handle that on their level because they be well experience in that but our farmer be currently not at that level where they can make a great deal with reliance or adani or any big private organisation so it be absolutely very easy for any big corporate to exploit them for their profit so we need a certain mechanism where we can protect our farmer that be why whether it be msp or something else we definitely need some mechanism to protect our farmer from these corporates as long a our farmer have not come into that level where they can handle this by their own

end of the day result be government bill on farmer be useless and farmer be not get benefit out of it thank you
this be not a farmer protest our farmer be not so rich these be political caders
we need farmer to fee u shame on indian government

although i be not in favour of imposing of income tax for farmer but i think now time have come that becoz of assured irrigation and msp paricularly in punjab haryana exclude southern haryana who own more than 10 ha of land income tax slab of 10 on farm income should be impose and collection of that income should be use for small farmer of these two state by give special scheme of income generating activity
malicious effort of the government shameless government there be no pity in it my heart be with the farmer now
salute to farmer atlas justice prevail
allah will help afghanis to fight these paxtaani talibani terrorist

love from pakistan ravish kumar
india be and always with farmer
it seem present farmer protester have no trust in bhartiya kisan sangh
wow what a great explanation i see how these bill be so so bad for our farmer thank you for open my eye
a view hold by many be that the law be frame in a way that do not just attract private player into the market but support and protect them a they gradually take over the agriculture sector ease the actual farmer and landowner out systematically
i m stand with farmer
in my experience farmer and villager be widely influence by politics and they be always interested to be a part of the political party this be what i have see throughout maharashtra
these be much need bill but only on the pretext that enough infrastructure be create indian agriculture do not improve any further after these msp be introduce why do not we join rcep be because of inherent weakness in our market where govt be the primary force but with this system it be not go to develop any further same be the issue when 1991 lpg reform be take up but we have see it impact though there be structural weakness in our economy these need to be correct to benefit fully only farmer from 2 state can not decide the future for rest of the country
modiji affraid of up election
first of all the administration should have take some action before the republic day because they must know that something will come of course on this day because the farmer be already give the warning that they would extract the tractor march
farmer leader fail coz they take the full responsibility and digest their own word that be except during the meeting with delhi commissioner
if farmer stop produce for just one year every one will understand
one peculiar observation that i come across be this these excessive and explicit anti hindu activity by maulana modi have suddenly aggravate after the ram mandir verdict by sc
congratulation to farmer
wow good batting by police helmet also nice but remember police we be n u alive bcoz of farmer produce food vegetable from 2day u do not buy any food only have salary

i stand with farmer the minister son should be arrest
so in short it be good for farmer
i think that this bill should be implement but the loophole of this bill should be resolve by government coz i think that these all problem be start because the farmer be not educate enough to handle these big thing

i also feel it be wrong on the protesting farmer part to ask the government to remove this law completely through out the nation
the bjp be sell the nation be railway and roadway to adani and ambani why no action against them
this channel be of tukde tukde gang why call this duplicate farmer if he get 10 crore also he will say budget be bad do not call this anti india people only negative how have earn his empire
this government of course have a brute majority in parliament but on the whole quiet a lot of people genuinely think many of the top governmental functionary lack the much need sophistication and grace the people be also a lot frustrate with constitutional organ like the judiciary who be often perceive a side with the rule party rightly or wrongly what the government should understand be that the negative politics be bombard on the indian polity by the bjp today have a limit and there should be proper governance transcend the medium of caste and creed the ruler in a democracy must be humble and go roughshod over farmer who fee the country be not good politics
i support the farmer 200

i agree with everything in this video but they should think that different state have different rate for the crop and let assume there be two state state 1 and state 2 and in state 1 the rate of everything be low from every other state and the farmer produce the crop in low price and in state2 the rate of everything be the high and the framer produce the crop in high price what if the farmer from state1 go to state2 and sell they in high rate so what will the farmer of the state2 do because he have produce the crop but he can not sell because the crop have already be sell by other farmer do he will go to the low state and sell there and will go in loss the answer be no if government really want to help farmer why do not they just the solve the problem state wise because every state be not same or the government want to give profit to the farmer of the one state and loss to the other fact punjab and haryana have the high rate for the crop
proud of you punjab haryana zindabad so emotional vedio

i be not sure about your mindset a it seem to oppose the govt for anything without constructive idea i suggest rather stick to msp or to repeal all 3 law it would have be good to force the govt to make the necessary change in the exist law for the welfare of farmer yeh law ko wapas karwane se political people ka yeh you tube channel walon ka hi benefit hua hai actual kisaan ka only loss hi ho raha yeh deshbhakt wale bhi chutiya hi kaat rahe well hota ki suggest karte to force the govt to have the required law for the welfare of farmer aise to again 0 par hi aa gaye koi improvement nahin msp be not a long term solution plus aise protest karke kisi bhi law ko wapas karwane ka tareeka will be dangerous in future lekin ch tiyon ko samajhta nahin only politics chamkani aur paisa bana rahe apna gareeb kisaan ke naam par gareeb kisaan aaj bhi pareshan hai

most of state do have majority of micro farm land hold so they mostly produce for self consumption punjab and haryana originally which be part of punjab do have majority of small farm land holding so we grow a part for self consumption and major part for rest of the country
wish government would explain this to farmer nicely articulate summarised historic reference and whole stitching together be truly cut the clutter
while i have utmost respect for everyones perspective and also understand completely the fear that farmer have of be absolutely buldozed by private sector if thing do not work the way govt have anticipate a a response they do not wish to accept these change and it their right not to however what i do not understand be oversimplification and have a myopic view
be not thei even a single educate farmer farmer will suffer asusual
sir you start with the farm law and your discussion quickly degenerate towards caa we understand very clearly what be happen all this aandolan be not go to stop at the farm law farmer in a far far large part of india be supportive of these law let be see if our pm want to keep on repeal good law like this and still hope to win the next election

if farmer dont want those bill then modi have to listen if these bill be for their benefit then absolutely it be their right to choose or refuse those bill and they refuse do not forget you be just because of public and i think you be fit on tea stall rather than the chair of pm
poor farmer will be take care of by modi through a different vehicle the key be to diffuse the real threat of unrest that be be manufacture through drug punjabi youth and khalistan and pakistan this be a wise decision of modi now opposition have no election agenda as well
we support this bill if one state not get advantage from it do not mean to let other poor farmer also suffer

3 industrialization it may not be agriculture itself but can surely improve the life of a lot of people who be in farm previously a it will create job opportunity for million to come out of agriculture and shift into comparatively high value manufacturing a service sector be legendary bad at provide enough job opportunity especially to a population as large a ours i hope you can relate it to india and agriculture though extremely important for life be very bad a a source of livelihood so we should focus at try to improve productivity of a farmer so that less and less farmer can also fee the nation and shift the rest into comparatively high value manufacturing industry
farmer be go to stay here
today the consumer class be silent apart from punjab and haryana big and small consumer in other state be also support modi because they still have religion and nationalism in their mouth

very interesting humble request please invite fresh to your show for discussion on current national political scenario and pre post farmer protest change in nation i think he be more eligible for answer your serious question
we support farmer
question why do bihar farmer not switch to the pulse and other vegetable if apmc act be not there in bihar since 2006 and the paddy price be low
so my congratulation to every single farmer and heartfelt condolence to the martyered one
india be reject bjp
the central government should listen to the farmer be
why sometimes onion become more than 100 per kilo and other vegetable at more than 50 per kilo simply the logic of apmc do not stand msp be here to stay and violent agitation on some hypothetical assumption be not acceptable thitrd why other state be not forthcoming with agitation fourth punjab and haryana be in the grip of organize syndicate of big farmer and since they be adversely affected they resort to such violent agitation
what type of people be you bjpians when he make the law you agree when he repeal the law you agree do not you have your own stand a an individual be a man not chaatukaaar
the indian medium do not show this either i really hope yall make out through this real soon lot of love and blessing from the pak
at 4 00 i want to point out there be a fallacy in the comparison with munawar the farmer be say that the end of msp will be the logical conclusion of the law no logic suggest that munawar if leave alone would make the joke that the mp police arrest him for
go wrong with farmer
i know that this farm bill issue be not black or white but it be entirely grey thanks for cover it i would like to show this to my friend
your discussion be not only illuminate but also inspire the three farm law a on today stand scrap you have endorse my hunch that the the agitation be basically engineer by rich farmer and middleman especially from punjab and haryana you miss one point that kerala essentially a socialist state never legislate apmc act hence the farmer do not have to offer their produce at designated marketplace to licensed middleman one reason could have be kerala be not into subsistence farming of paddy the other reason be must have be political which be that the entire focus of support the farmer be the farmer of punjab and haryana may be because the people who represent the farming interest at the centre be basically from these two state so the economic and political focus of green revolution be centre on these two state i would say a partisan approach to a national issue if farmer from other state be similarly engage there be no reason why they could not have rise to the occasion again there be no reason why 88 and 70 of national procurement of paddy and wheat should happen from punjab and haryana time the centre distribute it procurement more equitably among all indian state this will immensely benefit punjab and haryana a their farmer will shift focus to other crop thereby reduce the ecological burden on these state of grow rice and wheat
if govt withdraw the farm law what next what be takait goon plan for the improvement of farmer be the plan new storage facility new market new crop new connectivity new method of disburse payment be they go to give up subsidy fertilizer electricty
not every farmer be happy with this decision shame on pn and haryana farmer

these rule be very helpful for my family bcs we be small farmer
modi be a very egoistic person he must be have some other plan to screw unsuspecting farmer
very candid opinion on modi and bjp
there be nothing controversial about the farm law bring by modi govt ironically these farm law be in the election manifesto of the very political party who be oppose them now these farm law be sacred solely aim at benefit the real farmer not the goon you watch on tv who be disguise a farmer be murder rap destroy law order wreck havoc in the name of protest this mayhem be only limited to the 3 northern state of punjab haryana western part of uttar pradesh farmer of the rest of country have no problem about these law because these law will potentially eliminate middle men who be take away major portion of the farmer income from agricultural produce it be an elaborate propaganda run by the opposition party in india aim at defame modi india because they could not defeat modi in election they will never defeat him in the future too bbc be a star endorser of these type of fake agitation because they be pay a ton load of money anti india force like china pakistan khalistanis be heavily invest in these type of fake agitation opposition party in india be fully cooperate with such force they want to destabilize the country they be do quite well so far i m shock to see the comment here in support of this fake agitation it make me realize how effectively this malicious propaganda be be run manage no one know the truth they be peddle lie after lie these same people run the fake black life matter campaign which be a sham by the way
real farmer in field s rakesh tikayat make election stunt in up by plan prashant kisore
come on farmer
sir totally inspired with your study and knowlwdge you be a great person now i can say that i can understand the farm bill thanks
well explain one of the major issue here be that the corporates will compel the farmer to use certain type of seed seed that bill gate have manage to get patent for genetically enhance the quality of the seed they be expensive he be expel from ensure that farmer purchase those seed by a lady vandhana shiva he be go to get a backdoor entry
it be sane decision of farmer gp a govt have be proactive to to enhance the benefit it be expect to continue it effort unabated
he be the one who be try to create talibanis in india
your heading be wrong modi have not repeal the law yet he have just announce that he will repeal
rakesh tiket make alot of money from these protest and he be come in a political party
i just have one question why be not the government agree to farmer demand how be the government benefitting by not listen to the farmer
duty magistrate be might be have some real issue with the farmer
sorry do your further search there be farmer from rajasthan madeyeah pradesh etc be also join in
reason be very clear be it sc st or the farmer they be absolute power and vote bank
rakesh have expose himself badly again if he again go for election people will give him less than 1000 vote sad to see government have repeal the reformist law aim for poor farmer god bless india
congratulation to all farmer and specially tribute to those who lose their life in this battle of livelihood
the farmer agitation get support from all corner of the society success be eminent now
unfortunately sg this lecture be in english farmer in punjab haryana wont be able to understand easily sir make it available in hindi ultimate
i will tell you the ground reality of the farmer protest
punjab just keep fulfil the requirement of wheat and rice for whole india but couldnt do enough for itself
the repeal decision can be do in different way by use dummy politics to safe image of india not to lay down infront of protestor be either it be right or wrong demand from them there must be executive and judicial system as well to balance this mistake this give caa protestor be to protest and get whatever they want
stand with farmer
there be video of these so call farmer beat people to death why be it only punjab haryana rest of the farmer be on their field
finally modi ji show his real face
keep do last govt change his rubbish decision on farmer right
you be right bjp modi amit shah yogi desh drohi
i be here after repeal of farm bill
from this i be get a feeling that farmer r not the one who actually be protest but it be the buyer of these farmer be make them to protest state that the farm law will lead them to bad condition may b
few year back 2006 these be implement in bihar have they progress bhai mandi nhi hai wahan kisaano ke paas option nhi hai kahan bechega wo apni fasal msp nhi milti unko
simple india be for sale people be against this sale
7 40 these informal credit system base on trust develop over decade yes so please be patient and give formal system half a decade to be implement the result will be there to see the reason these farm law have be bring up so early in the 5 year of this govt be that there be 4 year before the next general election these law would start bear fruit and the farmer 6 only of total who be protest over msp will have no reason to complain by then i m not a big fan of any party but these bjp people be politically smart and they actually do thing they say they will do
indian government might not be support the farmer but all true indian be support our indian farmer brother jai jawan jai kisaan jai hind
shame on bjp government since 60 day past they can not take decission do not blame the farmer they be half brain with frustration why such government wait till datr

since congress be very communist to begin with this bjp be very capitalistic
why would a farmer travel inter state to sell his produce he know that if his produce be perishable then he need to sell it nearby as quickly a possible so then the middleman or trader can sell it to retail and consumer you think a farmer be like mr bill gate that if you give him freedom he will become a billionaire you really think trader will not exploit them outside a regulated market like apmc and be a farmer a corporate body with many department like marketing and sale that he can go anywhere and sell his produce at the best price this will be helpful to big farmer but it will affect small farmer and that onion thing be utter nonsense how can you allow so many middleman and trader to just exploit the price of commodity the way they want that need to be regulate a well
i just want to ask them where be you when farm law and government need your support
i see clear path to victory for aap in punjab
a minister make bombastic threatening statement his son provide the muscle to dispatch all opposition to smithereens police work hand in glove with the perpetrator godi medium make wild accusation

wrong message and wrong time this only show that no matter you win by huge majority you still can not pass any bill or law if there be protest by negative force with ulterior motif huge loss of face and demonstration of weakness by modi for bend down to khalistanis call themselves farmer a very dangerous precedent
my condolence to those 700 farmer who lose thr life while protest
but when do you list out the benefit of the new farm bill
guy watch faye desouza be discussion with p sainath he address all the three peril of this bill which meghnad present a pro here 1 the destruction of apmcs 2 what contract farm do to our farmer and our food crop across the country 3 essential commodity act removal now also mean black marketing and hoarding in addition to what be happen with the lack of msp this be a total mess
with this move bjp might not win the next loksabha election
we support farmer

this triseries be damn good gon na recommend it to everybody who argue that farmer be wrong
you should not generalise farmer of whole country for some so called farmer who have do anything wrong
but in the end of day it be farmer who decide which system they want to continue by sell their product to apmc they can keep apmc alive and kill the bill why protest for a parallel ecosystem where it boost the economy for build up new food processing industry
but let be wait for his next innovative step for the welfare of farmer
time for modi to repeal himself and move back to let yogi amit shah himanta etc to step up and take up leadership to regain confidence and not be afraid to take tough decision for the country
2 how easy will it be to deal with corporate even for a group of farmer
farmer have lack of commercial education about agriculture investment and technology then farm law show the farmer to leave the agriculture sector but today farmer show they be become educate this be very good a big revolution a 21st century demand for india be on the way
we support modiji let each state decide what they want some gunda state andcfactions be try to control label every state agricultural product and then the electorate will show how much the law be require
first of all my sincere respect and support to farmer
ome farmer die and no police mem be die but both be injure and that men die tldue to gun shot go and saw his photo due to which he lose his balance on tractor

frauds it not broker pay the tax farmer pay the tax broker be buy it from farmer less price if he sell outside he will get good price 10 janpath salve stop this nonsense
plus green revolution happen because farmer income increase immediately but this time while shift to some sort of organic farming farmer be reluctant cause the only thing they be see be drastic change without change their earnings
so in short the agriculture sector be in shit and the current govt reform piss off the farmer even more
kisan andolan matlab sajish this could be part of conspiracy to get political benifits against yogiji

love the lecture and the content relate to the technicality of farm law also i be happy that vikas sir be prediction about the farm law that they will stay and modi will not repeal it be fail he be a very knowledgeable person but yes we all sometimes undermine the power of protest

it be because of uas government support them else there might not be any name like taliban
thanks sir for support farmer
at the same time the fact be that the people be all on the side of the farmer
the real problem be that in all case where regulatory body be functional both party be literate but in farmer case one be literate corporate other be illetrate farmer that be why the govt be in no mood to accept his mistake
and hence i think it all depend on the farmer what they want to do the bill be not detrimental to the farmer in any way the middleman state govt will lose their money that be it
now kissan leader be mislead farmer

as long a central govt do not collude with private company i think these reform be good for farmer freedom
withdrawal of the 3 farmer amendment act be not lose to the bhagawan shri modi ji and his government but it be that all most all loses to the small or big farmer of india dark soul give disturbance to the government of india by the name of true saint farmer market
also many people be comment on how this bill will take away there right to go to court in case of dispute but the truth be this bill provide a proper legal framework that be be create to protect the farmer of india and not the big private company
informative video but why do you not mention the issue of the minimum support price if commodity be remove from the essential commodity list will company not be at liberty to push down the buying price of these commodity to the break point to purchase them from farmer at the low price possible the company may then sell these commodity at increase price in the market but that do not necessarily mean that farmer will earn more
almost everyone say open up the market be good it look like farmer also be not concern about it but they be more worried abt msp the chance of deal with big corporates the possible disruption of exist system to sell their produce and hence the temporary difficulty they might face logically open up be the best way to get everyone involve a fair deal but just open without a proper support system be only go to favor the big corporates bcs they be well inform and always prepare there should be support system for guide the farmer from switch from wheat to others or help them in deal with big corporates also government should facilitate start ups with innovative idea to revolutionize the farming like use technology and the focus should be in those area while open up rather than help corporates with money and muscle power to find a new blue ocean the government be stubbornness and rush be probably make farmer suspicious reliance be acquire big bazar tata be buy big basket and it hard to believe these be just coincidence so if someone have doubt on these reform they be not unfounded
govt should arrest tiket on tada act he be a main culprit who want to burn india let all indian come forward and give one way ticket to rakesh tiket jai hind
congress party idea of show rahul and priyanka gandhi a center face be good idea but not sure if it will work to fight bjp

historical victory for farmer
mark pm be word carefully he have call farm law a good for farmer mention govt be inability to convince a section of farmer about the same apologize to all countryman not to agitate farmer say law be bring in the interest of farmer but be be repeal in the interest of nation it be a multi factorial decision only pm can be aware of all the relevant factor for the decision it will not be appropriate for anybody else to pass a judgement opinion can vary
if bjp loos election then the soul of the farmer who die will rest in peace farmer be back bone of our country
what happen be a clear case of communication gap and misunderstand the protest be go on peacefully but then there come a third party that try to fuel up the moment they try to agitate the farmer due to which the attack start the police also reciprocate and the result be a total chaos what happen be very inhuman and disrespectful this could have be do with more patient and wisdom by both the side very sadden
the farmer demand be genuine appreciate your effort to show the real thing happen out there
govt ko sakat action against socold kisan very soon abhi toh have ho gai yaar

samdish love the way you give respect to the farmer for you
sg on the front foot the farm law be good and most of india have no problem with it that be evident from the lack of protest in most of the country could not the govt have change the nature of the law allow the state to implement a they wish they should have caa and nrc rule have yet to be frame and even the labour law which the country badly need be yet to see the light of implementation it up to the pm to show some spine and get these two good law go
herein bangalore karnataka bjp be desided not to allow farmer to city ndtv kindly cover
drishti ia be a youtube channel which go through detail analysis of the farm bill it be a 3 hr vedio and the bill suggest that farmer can cell there produce to the mandi and also decide the cost of the produce
great video thx so the consensus i can arrive at base on this information be this farm bill be not comprehensive and lack application of thought my thought be simply this if today with all the tech and knowledge and experience we have gain we can not take care of u farmer and bring down the price on essential and non essential item it be depress and really sad i have great expectation from this govt i sincerely hope we a a nation work towards solve all the gap and redraft this to make it more comprehensive to ensure the corporates dont play with the 50 and 100 which i guarantee that any company will do far i dont see how this will stop hoarding in our country where our judicial system take forever to resolve case how much peace will it bring to the farmer most of who have not be able to get even the basic education busy feed our country to have a legal contract i dont see this a solution to the problem face today if anything it seem only make a big mess
farmer income should rise imo pls explain abt pro and con in layman language some one literate and knowledgeable pls apmcs storage ration msps do help but will they be require in the future most of the farmer be poor explain frm environmen t conservative social societal and modern point of view
this be when godi medium show you false image of farmer protest sell medium bjp it cell
for u farmer i would say dont create chaos in city let govt function when govt remove msp then we will do protest
yeh sabko pta hai these chanel godi medium republic tv aajtak abp india today zee news 18 tv9 etc
it be totally acceptable if farmer do protest for something if they do not like about government
i believe this be a wise move by the bjp and pm modi i would encourage the government to go far one step and repeal all subsidy that in actual fact benefit the middle man and unscrupulous landlord let each individual state to sort their own subsidy for their farmer in the absence of reform let be see how long these farmer want to continue with their stupidity and opposition when their pocket book start to really hurt furthermore it be unfair for the rest of the country to foot the subsidy bill for state that oppose the farm reform bill who think they know good how to run their farming industry all state that support the farm reform bill should be encourage to enact law for their state to formalise the new law and look towards create common market union among these state for the benefit of their farmer
people should be wise while voting because what be speak today if the same thought be think almost one year back about the farmer there would not have be so many death among the farmer now the main reason be the forthcoming election the farmer as well a other citizen must be very careful in voting and select their leader one should not believe in floral speech floral speech be give when something be behind it we pray that god bless our country be citizen with god be wisdom and not human wisdom after so many farmer be kill wife lose their husband husband lose their wife child lose their father and mother how can a leader of our country replace these loss and forget all these thing give such floral speech will not help people god bless our country
we stand with you we will not forget what happen at the golden temple in 1984 khalistan be the answer freedom from india oppression
thanks thank a lot medium for represent farmer worldwide please cover all footage of farmer protest
glad u be not bias on your take we just need unbiased news in these time if there be proper regulation of this with farmer not be take advantage of then i tnk the farmer will be hugely benefit by this bill
one big problem with bjp be that they expect too much sacrifice from mass demonetization motor vehicle amendment act raise the fine compulsory fastags fuel price etc etc i would be comfortable if there be equal sacrifice by rule elite but their perk keep increase 6th 7th pay commission keep increase sarkari salary without any substantial increase in productivity
farming be a lose making business for farmer if they will not get a proper selling price then all farmer will quit do farm then what will you eat
now farmer be terrorist wah modi wah
2 the new design will eventually replace arhtiyas middleman with corporation farmer esp small farmer have some say in negotiation with middleman because of social and local political factor they can work with local sarpanch mlas etc who have a benefit in help local farmer in case of corporation do you think a small farmer can fight a court case when a corporation promise 50 r kg for onion before sow but give you only 5 r kg after cultivation cite factor like it too much moisture not good quality etc etc
i support farmer be protest i also support caa protest they all work a star pracharak event for modi and bjp because these protest create a strong feeling of nationalism among common people which normally remain dormant of india and make bjp strong these protest also work as filter that clearly separate out who be for the country and who be against it
well explain the reform look good in paper but open up the market to private player do not guarantee and a smooth transaction the issue of apmc price management can also pop up when big private corps step in similarly the misuse in contract farming can also be suppressive to the farmer the farm law arnt perfect however they could have be send a parliamentary standing committee before be pass hastily without in depth expert input
modi have stick with some of his tough position demonetization and lockdown be the most criticized i do not believe that he need to back off for political game up be strong under yogi there be something else happen in punjab and we really should wait until the dust settle there be no need to try and analyze it with such knee jerk reaction aim i believe be anti modi but do you have any alternative
democracy win farmer win
i will support the farm bill if anyone can explain how the govt be go to handle all of the below list point copy from a fb post i still will not support the way govt treat the protesting farmer over 160 die in 2 month while on protest
you do not tell anything about new farm bill and start compare it
corrupt govt need to stop this scam of buy vote on the name of send farmer 2000rupee every 3 month instead make msp a law so farmer get their cost make mw minimum wage law so general labour work in city and metro city in construction renovation clean gardner and servant and maid for rich and ultra rich above middle class
his view be totally govt centric he supply that the hey be big farmer small farmer if we have that much wheat in surplus distribute that to poor people accross india
i pray to god to protect our farmer stay strong we will win
maybe in a few year time or even month we might well see the no 1 crony capitalist of the present government become the rich person in the world on the one hand and on the other hand indian farmer have difficulty in even make end meet
loss to the farmer and farm sector because of the bad politics of modi who fail to present the benifits of farm law but a great win for the democracy indeed
some part of law be problematic it do not allow the farmer to go to court if they feel they be wrong by the dealer the high official for that be sdm that be create fear in farmer why govt have to add this extra bit in the law if tomorrow you be wrong by someone and not allow to go to court by some new law would you not oppose it would like to know sg be view on this
we be support farmer bhai
i think farmer should be responsible because they should not go to the red fort
i wonder who be the pm of india modiji or trudeau
good decision by govt not compare it caa or 370 it be for indian farmer
good presentation gvt must work with farm leader to work on new law input with all will help with new farm law this be not a loss for modi or win for farmer common sense win over
rich people in our comfortable home i support hard work farmer protest against injustice after injustice but moral high ground speech against violence
but let be wait for his next innovative step for bthe welfare of farmer
these soilders be themselves son of farmer but how shamelessly they be behave with them just for penny of government salary
this be godi medium not aaj tak
please understand that cooperate mean not one company multiple company will be there in field and farmer may go for best one who give more price to them
proud to be farmer
we r with farmersugly face modi govt
full support strong support from indian muslim to our sikh brother and farmer from all over india
this time im not with farmer at all
very right that the benefit of msp be go only to the rich farmer while the poor farmer be unable to improve their condition the new farm reform law address this concern by allow the private sector in the agriculture field the concern that the private sector would exploit the farmer acquire their land be a conservative one it be clearly mention in the new law that the private player can not take farmer land the law be make to protect the farmer interest while at the same time modernise the agriculture sector with the help of the private sector
i feel that this reformed agriculture bill propose by gov need some change amendment to ensure that our most diligent hardworking farmer brother get their truly deserving reward
very bad to know about our indian farmer condition now they have come out from their house and protest under the sky to get the proper facility from the government for all of u to cultivate the food we have teach in the college our development base on green revolution after that we enter in industrial revolution farmer be not only back bone of developed country they have well know a our food kitchen where we get day night meal farmer stand among u just like at home the relationship of parent and child the problem be our corrupt politician image all time five star hotel life just use and through the food plat how will teach them to do the justice respect and love how many hand be involve to bring the food in your eating plate where ever justice not in action then wait for big punch from our creator in shape of many disaster to the nation almighty allah fulfill the need of our farmer keep them safe happy and successful ameen
more unbiased than anyone else video on farm bill thank you mam

inhumanity and stubbornness be in bjp blood if they win again i be sorry for my country we need resign of modi amit shah and yogi

this devil only say in previous video to talk with taliban a solution and criticize afghanistan investment now challenge modi to ban taliban that be mean he be pro taliban and have strong confidence on taliban and hakani network he will support palestine but not afghanistan you can see the hypocrite level of this man
we be a one nation completely support our farmer but let be not make it a political issue
if indian medium and indian anchor and their analyst have be so smart and brave they would not have give ladakh the finger area so carelessly and stubbornly incompetently to china instead of worry about afghanistan and start worry about seven state because despite have 200 000 indian troop india would not have to send it special commando out of kashmir to the arunachal pradesh and siliguri corridor just you and your indian medium anchor and so call analyst shame on you for how long you people will continue to make fool of your people and nation by block them
be invite private company to buy farmer produce directly
i think the fourth generation war strategy be highly adaptable in india because both party in india ruling and opposition use this tactic well but i be surprise that we be lose this strategy of war against other country i do not understand that reason
hi shekhar i agree with most of the thing u have mention in the video and thanks for share such a valuable information but i do not think that the intention of the modi government by bring this bill be to persuade farmer to produce more diverse crop like moongfali musturd and all the other crop india be import from other country that india really need that u have mention i have not hear even a single statement from the government about all these problem that u discuss i want to agree with you that government really have a good agenda behind this bill but i do not see any statement from government
please remember 600 farmer have lose their life please keep that in mind vote wisely
we stand with indian farmer in this time of despair
farmer be punjabi and haryana other state be only small holding
why khachhar want to talk to farmer now his supreme leader doesnt want to talk to them only his pitthoos

any way finally true suffering community be farmer now political equation of punjab may change
video title should be police provoke farmer

anonymous official we be in a state where slavery have be accept wholesale and there be people who believe that the ruling class have the legitimate moral right to rule and other people be legitimately their slave this be really where we be at in humanity worldwide and the vast majority of people have accept that paradigm and what it be it be a cult religious belief system that be completely false completely erroneous there be not enough people speak out encourage that that be a false paradigm and belief system this be what the message that we have to put out there to this body of the population that still believe the mainstream medium narrative and still believe the government narrative to believe in authority be to condone slavery that be exactly what it be stop sugarcoat it and start say what it be to other people to believe in authority be to condone slavery if you be a believer in authority and you be a believer that there be moral legitimacy to government you be someone who be say i believe in and condone slavery because that be what the right to command and rule other people be it be slavery and that be what government be on it face and i will not sugarcoat that that be what it be i m here to put that out there a the plain and simple truth and encourage others to do the same there be no such thing a the right to rule or command others we have to stop believing that there be because to even believe it be to condone slavery and it be completely immoral and it be completely base on violence so now what be happen be that the narrative of this master class be be say never to be question it be not to be question by member of the slave class this be what all this social shaming be all about by the member of the cult see the cult member want to point finger at other people who do not believe their worldview of authority their authoritative authoritarian worldview you know they want to say oh shame on you no not shame on u shame on you for accept that slavery be morally legitimate how about that that be how the table have to be turn your worldview be false and illegitimate morally on it face and now big tech company big tech corporation be try to make it impossible to get the word out by censor social medium and censor people and deplatforming them and all that be gon na do be insight very very dark day ahead let be just say it be already turn in that direction because of how people have be oppress and people do not understand what it be a powder keg it be not just a powder keg here in america folk it be a powder keg worldwide and you better psychologically prepare yourself and i m tell everybody out there too because most people who say they be for the truth and for freedom do not do their work they fail at their job to morally educate the public there be not enough of the voice of truth the reality be speak into existence lady and gentleman the universe have speak into existence what we experience in our daily reality in the aggregate in the collective be base upon what people say what people accept into them the information they take in and that be what inform their behavior and now what the rule class want to do be try to make it impossible to get that word out there and they be go to ensure a violent outcome a a result of that that be what i have be try to prevent from day one and that be what i have be try to tell my viewership and listenership that it be your personal responsibility through your action to help prevent by teach people true morality and unfortunately we be fail in that job collectively we be fail in that job and you be go to see the result of that failure in the physical world these people believe that all alternative viewpoint of reality perspective of reality be to be ban and banish and even possibly make illegal okay people who do not accept their worldview a it be put out there by the mainstream medium and the government and other official or expert be not to be challenge and they be to have their right strip from them if they do not accept that worldview well i do not accept your worldview i believe my knowledge be far superior to yours and i m not afraid to tell you that the real reality of this be be no one have the right to force a worldview upon others we have the right to speak what the truth be i can not ultimately force it on anybody i could just show an ignorant person how they have be deceive but just like i can not force my worldview on other people no one can force their worldview on me or others because here be the truth of the matter folks government medium and even scientist be not the arbiter of truth truth exist independently of any human be be perception of it it be our goal to bring our perception into alignment with that which be namely the truth and we have to do that through a rigid truth discovery psychology and take in high volume of eclectic information from all over many different source even those we do not agree with put them all together logically weed out all inconsistency so that we distill it down to the base essence of that which be true and only then can we say we have an accurate understanding of what be take place and most people do not do that process lady and gentleman i do do that process and i m not go to have people that do not do it tell me what i must believe because an expert say it i will perform the truth discovery methodology process on the information myself and come to my own conclusion about it and so should everyone else so no one be gon na tell me other people be the arbiter of truth no one be the arbiter of truth not even me not you not anyone a an individual their conclusion do not mean that it be the truth and their conclusion can not be violently push upon others that be what be unfortunately take place in our world people with no knowledge just completely give into fear and the big fear be fear of the unknown because fear of the unknown be what hold people back from knowledge and high awareness see if you fear knowledge because you fear what you might discover it be go to create a feedback loop of fear because fear come from lack of knowledge those who be inform be not in fear ignorance be what create fear refusal of truth be what create fear i have no such fear because i have accept what truth be and i have align my perception to it but here be where we be at folk societally this be what self mastery be all about understand the law of the universe understand natural law and then actually apply that true spirituality in one be life through our behavior through our action in the right way through right action the next way out be self respect true respect true look again at the quality of ourself a an individual self respect be the true healer you want to cure the real human sickness then apply the true healer which be self respect first and foremost this be the development of internal courage to look at the truth and then to speak the truth publicly not just to your family and friend where you think it be safe it need to be out there publicly in a courageous way where you be tell people i m not afraid you know turn off the lie fearmongering state control medium it be an affront to self respect stop believing that others have the right to command you there be no such right there be no such moral right this be the way out true courage courage be the universe be protection it be universal protection we talk about you know protective equipment you know to shield u from illness this be the real universal protection to shield u from spiritual illness that be what courage be be bold and mighty force will come to your aid the people who be step up the people who be say no we be not go to have this we be gon na go back to our life we be not gon na take government mandate we be not gon na take government command because you do not have the right to command u we be free and we be gon na act like it you know step into that kind of courage create the universe be protection i m protect because i m not afraid i m not afraid of what can be do to me in the physical domain and you know what real protection be go to come in the form of step into the courage to teach natural law that be a spiritual understanding if you exercise courage for the right thing and you teach the right thing and you teach natural law mighty force of creation will come to your assistance and aid in your life in all your endeavor and that be where my protection come from so we have to say the lost word which be no and we need to fall in love with it this be the lost word we have to say no to evil we have to say no to authoritarianism we have to say no to worldview violence we have to say no to external control no one have the right to externally control rule or command u and we need to fall in love with that word that be a vibratory energy of courage and protection the word no no you do not own me no i be not your slave no you do not have the right to command me and others no one do so folks it look like this the lost word through the knowledge of natural law a truly awakened human be be finally able to speak the lost word which be no no be the word of all power and only when we say no to those who would claim to be our owner do we stop externalize our power and in do so reclaim all of our natural right and that happen when we start to say no to those who would claim to be the ruler of our life the word no be another form of the word on we say no we d turn on the light

why do not the government shortlist agricultural item which can be export say like onion then gradually wean the farmer towards more productive land use

look like the pro khalistanis and pakistani agenda similar to the very well pre plan well execute in delhi riot people be smart enough to put two and two together the modus operandi be so glaring
we stand with you farmer
these 3 law be wrong here and now because of the way they be introduce and because of the room they create for corruption however they signal an inevitable evolution they will fail today because of how profoundly they represent the nature and will of the current administration however they will resurface in the future with a new look and a different energy simply because it be the only way forward to enable economic freedom and create competitiveness on a global scale india be farmer must collectively organize and empower themselves to take control of their own destiny and grasp the lever of free market utilization to create wealth and economic independence today they be still manipulate by opportunist and illegal collaborator who take advantage of exist policy to enrich themselves at the expense of simple mind and marginal landowner efficiency must be realize by utilize agricultural india limit natural resource to continue to fee an explode population the intermediate way forward be to give farmer the tool and the wisdom to start down a road to first realize and appreciate their latent collective power to create a free market in their own image and second to create a robust environment in which to recognize appreciate and honestly process the complexity create by the indian way of thinking and operating this be the way

the law wouldve benefit the large farmer undoubtedly however the one to lose wouldve be the lay 2 3 bigha owner why would pepsico go buy potato from a 2 bigha owner care to write agreement with him rather than go to someone who own 50 hectares it funny to see how this all be elusive to most of the urban elite yapping here the small farmer will lose through commercialisation of agriculture his holding will become unviable once the private sector step in and he will be force to enter contract with them effectively reduce him to a sharecropper tenant with no urban job to attract surplus labour from the village rather village become sponge when covid cause massive urban to rural migration where will the surplus labour go other than become labourer in their own field effectively revive zamindari and company raj

2 the third bill intention be to bring a third party organization into farming and protect farmer from famine and other natural disaster while also increase the diversity of agricultural product which be currently very limited due to a lack of certainty in post harvesting income look at how much wheat production be increase in up mp and punjab and how mp recently cross 300 mt of wheat production in the year 20 21 which get waste due to very poor storage facility so the clarity would come from a proper dialogue with farmer and curb the weak area of law to make them legible and clearer which i think goi try up to some extent but we all saw what exactly happen if the implementation of these bill have be effective with proper clarity then it would have make farmer more confident and secure so they could have start think toward other farming option and process and may eventually shift towards organic farming as well
