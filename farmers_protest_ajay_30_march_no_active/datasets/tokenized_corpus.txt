since agriculture state subject state should have be into confidence centre have encroach state jurisdiction though at present msp be continue there scope for end which endanger farmer interest though objective of bill say be elimination of middleman namaste indeed small middleman would be replace with huge corporate house which mean centralization scope form syndicate and dictate term meanwhile large number of so call middleman render jobless and thrown into poverty i e amass wealth by few individual repeal essential service commodity act or remove food grain great harm public give trader huge scope create artificial scarcity and hoard fleece public money i sight horrible future and terrible exploitation

sir iam fan of your lecture but i do not agree with minimum support price which be give by indian government basically farm sector most hard one compare any other sector but amount they get from very less or camparitavily loss due this situation many farmer do suicide because of loss iam not against indian government but when ever we private people in any sector they will think about profit so here government should strictly give guidance for price in same way we should reduce paddy grow cost by encourage machine in agriculture sector by give subsidy for farmer i be agree government give subsidy but not reach poor farmer be distribute among rich landlord farmer by use their political influence in my point government should encourage reduce cultivation capital and give proper guidance for minimum support price properly in ground level because people have no option that why your not buy my paddy a government market because we have right question government but here private people mainly concentrate on profit government should proper measure overcome
do not know how on name of farmer people work a protest more than 50 percent in protest they broker which farmer money and for that government have pass law by which all broker will lose their money and all money will go too farmer pocket

state like bihar do not have mandi system they have private sector who never give them appropriate price of there crop bihar already have private sector for buy crop from farmer from past 10 year than also bihar farmer poorest in country with 5000 monthly income where a state like haryana who have govt mandis farmer income 14 000 per month so bringing private sector in agriculture surely not solution of this problem problem remove middle man or make law for compulsury follow by all state and increase wearhouse system where govt can store good amount of food sell other country india on no 1 sell food in international market than also indian farmer poorest world
this not do i very disappointed by modi ji what benefit of have 300 seat and still can not implement bill on ground this set example of any group people can come together and oppose any bill block road and pressurise government revoke that bill so what benefit of have power those bill be wrong than why early support those bill and argue on very stage i do not think there any benefit of have majority government anymore
see farmer misinform about msp law dont have anything do with msp itself and govt have assure that also apmc with thier msp will not go even after 100 year if apmc act undisturbed it actually farmer choice that they want sell in mandi or private sector so punjabs farmer should continue sell in mandi and dont sell in private sector
i don t know why govt do not give it ensurance poor farmer regard msp
in short this bill very good for farmer thanks

i tolly agree with this video but resons behind why farmer protest in my opinion this that particular farmer in haryana and punjab mostly grow wheat and rice mainly small farmer and when they have sell their product they will get less price and when they have buy other product like pulse grams patotes etc they have pay more a say in video prises will get increase and
they never do farm nor work in farm but earn more money than actual farmer

regard farm produce will definitely follow commodity cycle of wild upswings and downswing we can see how much price of onion fluctuate every single year in fact many customer like my mother use their benefit by build up inventory at low price naive farmer will sadly suffer whether at hand of corporate or middleman politician a usual will act for their own benefit

bring any reform in india process of educate farmer paramount i do believe that mr modi always think in favour of mass and in this case how make farming very competitive with big return there no doubt reform in farm need india new level however farmer concern be that measure of reform would benefit corporates and corporates would dictate their term farmer this aspect make them extremely uncomfortable
sir i really like your argument very well articulate financial and economical side of these bill seem good but first actually produce different crop and diversify production not easy expensive which why have msp provide assurance farmer a they dont get pay every month like everyone who work in some kind of professional field bill not bad but shouldnt govt build infrastructure first that will provide farmer with assurance like increase price of other crop and guarantee minimum support price

3 40 farmer tax pay apmc mandi maintains road that connect mandis and enable transport of produce if mandis not maintain maintenance of these will be affect okay if private competitor come will they airlift all produce not private company go arrange easy access produce for themselves they will once they can why these facility not good already 70 year after independence that too in india bread basket or whatever we teach in school because nobody have care till now
true that farm law can not completely solve problem infact in long term pose many threat too but retrieve already inefficient apmc mandi system just like want go back jail have always exploit farmer but in that light farm law certainly revolutionary reform for sector but some research in bihar have prove that take off of apmc system not go benefit farmer rather than put them in far more stressing condition so farm law eventhough have many good point in will benefit farmer only if loop hole in law close one of concern exploitation by big private player and agriculture not like any other sector we can not predict nature and hence harvest so that farm law will not turn into another apmc style also agriculture sector and system in india so complicate but noteworthy that south indian state have different system get max profit for their produce one of system uzhavar santhai in tamil nadu interesting system

another disadvantage of contract farm that company might ask for specific quality of crop which farmer cant ensure a crop grow under open sky unlike potato chip in factory so if there excess rain or presence of weed in crop that will increase price of harvest therefore harm already poor farmer
with large section of indian population who farmer livelihoods at stake natural for them suspect intention of current ruler see botched implementation of gst and bad decision like demonetization one can not simply accept anything throw on oneself without protest althoug current set of farm law be look ground breaking at face one can not ally fear what might happen when these implement similar situation have occur in with negative result where corporates have undue advantage i think these law need be redo with extensive discussion with farmer from every state and slow but careful implementation need be think out devil always remain in detail

difference between china and india china can progress well by implement good change whereas india can not implement any change due their political system about this farmer issue i watch documentary how political opposition gather non farmer impersonate a real farmer and create unnecessary trouble solution all indian problem give prime minister modi same power a chinese president have over decision make for his country but that will make india super power which could be good thing for world a i have learn from indian history that india can only spread message of peace non violence since ancient time i have never see original indian be aggressive or violent in fact indian have never be good at fight and war bear in mind that almost 33 of indian population now not original indian
every one have right protest peacefully but public should not be disturb govt and farmer should talk on this matter bussinessman like adani should not be allow purchase farmer crop small farmer should be help by government big farmer should give tax govt msp should be give farmer
how pathetic these people in comment say we support farmer just by see this video well do india

so why do punjabi farmer benefit from msp while other indian farmer do not that not fair either so either all farmer should get msp or none at all
bjp son hit farmer and now 4 farmer dead so that we do okkkkkkk
ok so after see entire video have just reiterate think tank niti aayog 2018 report about reduce procurement of wheat and rice from haryana and punjab alright i get your point but what everyone should in mind it india that we live in and current govt just act on whim and do not involve people like educate them what have not describe in this video impact of these upcoming bill on farmer yes i totally agree that apmcs need be fix but system work there problem but work and we all know what happen with gst demonetisation etc
obviously similar situation can not be rule out for local good trade by local small farmer vi vi his corporate client
give farmer their right they also indian
then these law can be implement by state government that will help state eventually and that state could become role model of prosperous farmer
hence instead of this mindset mentality that best quality will get msp and anything else will get below msp on gradual level wrong this exploitation mentality and result farmer suicide who couldnt sustain

during meeting centre ensure msps they will make ammendments for that they have also give that they will allow civil court in these bill but farmer protestors do not want that also they only want 3 bill bcoz they middleman and not farmer
govt ready give assurance about msp in write format but not willing mention in particular law that hypocrisy how can be this explain your video more tilted toward problem of apmc law rather than what potential threat can be generate by private player if they allow procure agril product below msp when govt can change previous apmc act and can build new law make cold storage and can make another provision for quick and efficient transportation of agricultural product then why give such grand way private market player control economy why cooperative structure very well establish and prove best in maharashtra and gujarat in case of sugarcane industry n milk production respectively or farmer produce organization fpo not give more attention than give more control few capitalist family

even if these 3 bill still become reality think of middleman who would ensure small farmer that they would transport their yield and sell at high price in far off location a small farmer would not have time and transport capability drive at least 100 km think of tax levy on state border on farmer who transport their yield in different state now all highway go be flood with tractor and cause lot of traffic get on ground reality and then make decision
this will help government propoganda of double farmer income by 2022

plan route be not good those be outside capital and indian flag waive at high position moreover that flag not khalistani flag that nishan sahib and modi govt sell red fort private company dalmia but no one question

this protest start by farmer of india reason for this protest govt declare law agriculture section normally our farmer sell their product through apmc market apmc market market there minimum selling price give farmer from elderly so that farmer can sell their product through apmc market and will get minimum selling price or more than that buyer have pay tax for product they buy aim of apmc market get minimum selling price farmer every farmer start there production by take loan from someone they very poor people many be suicide because of price for there product get very low new law of our uneducated and bad prime minister of indian history honarable prime minister mr modiji and their party that they give permission corparates company buy product from farmer and sell buyer normally not problem but thing buyer do not want pay tax for buy from corparates in apmc they nave pay tax and corparates do not maintain minimum selling price for farmer so people will go corparates because there no tax payment and apmc market will fall down and farmer do not get minimum price so suicidal attempt of farmer will not stop and that will go on apmc market also govt property modi govt support only corparates because they funders of modi political party bjp so have work accornding corparates democracy equality and every thing go away by idian citizen

government approach cut off various middle men link that exists in country because supply reguated at least twice before reach city or town market different tier of middle men create their own profit which indeed exploit original price which earn by farmer if law will cut out these men then most probably farmer can earn good price but implementation sparkle protest because many of these farmer who out here protest themselves part of local trade link or have not clearly understood government plan also i personally think because congress political party have fund punjab farmer a punjab congress state and party have influence there simply defame bjp central government and a can see protester all punjabi and not even single person can be see who not punjabi

now those farmer should protest who want pass these bill not only farmer i think everyone who support these bill should come forward and stop this repealing of bill
legal what will happen if repeal bill do not get majority
seem for moment good decision from electrol perspective but how long reform go get stall like this especially when this issue only related vested interest of some section of one state or rich section belong one caste and rest of india not much worry or rather it more of beneficial law let me ask question why particular state or caste need be silent by feed with money that can be spend for great good for country especially this will impact only middleman and so call farmer will be still under their control and their own fate other state have show good result and move forward every law need be discuss and gov use opportunity bypass parliament i believe government do give enough explanation in parliament and most political party have this reform a part of their manifesto no one have gut implement l can understand if related land reform or if impact regional linguistic or cultural aspect or major constitutional amendment except for 370 and 371 of this nation that definitely need wide discussion and more careful analysis even law that have wide implication be pass without much deliberation or less discussion ie nep so accord sekhar sir logic any law that impact punjab or haryana or western up need be discuss explicitly discuss in parliament and rest fine or can be ignore sorry i do not this point may be bit harsh but fact
very good for farmer jai hind jai bharat
these be seperatists clip if nishad there exclusively mention of sikhon ko maarne not farmer

those who r say that this bill would open different way for farmer just note that corporation control by businessmen they would buy crop at even low price than msp and would sell them at much elevate price consumer just make more profit and this situation can not be prevent because corporates not transperant and no arrangement and measure make against these situation by government in these so called bill so in short this bill big fuck consumer and producer
part of interviewer reaction be so insincere by both manisha and atul lousy interview only person who be sincere here be rakesh tikait
their unity can atleast see through couple of year of corporates enter farm sector in rest of country later they can decide if they do not want corporates they can still remain united and maybe protest then with real life bad example of this bill instead of protest in assumption in that case entire nation will understand and stand by protest instead of just 2 state

if real farmer have any problem comeout from tikait and talk any educated people and ask or discuss their worry upon bill
opposition have no work now they will blame for happening in year 2029 because modi ji will be pm
i think your comment negative on farm reform despite fact admit farm long good and then make comment on merit irrespective of farmer accept them or not
pm modi quite good at communication this matter really need be solve by proper discriptive communication and must remove any misconception if farmer have any cause we know their opposite party a well bcoz this protest not good for farmer as well

i still doubt govt will fulfill their demand they have only one step back and will see them back with all might and vengeance great see farmer grit and determination and your commitment honest journalism they oust from their channel and now have become household name and brand all best sir worthy of their praise
since when do free market become bad thing farmer in india shy away from grow organic produce and choose grow standard gmo crop because of msp since they know quality of no relevance any quality support by government promise minimum support price free market lead competition amongst producer well investment in product which relevant market demand example of avocado across world sustainable profitability for producer and also good quality product at good price for consumer product like rice can not be monopolize by large corporate because if that true then amul have already monopolize milk industry in india milk producer get fair value for their product yes because if amul will not pay local producer fair price someone else will or milk producer will sell directly customer which they do even now farmer protest base on fear mongering and unfortunately small percentage of educate class also stand in their support out of confirmation bias just because give them opportunity reaffirm their hate towards political ideology

do not use word msp in whole video here then why show false statement on left side of screen moreover msp not mention in farm bill too
anyone tell me what good this bjp do for india other than make people sleep in street
hence govt must ensure that private sector as well a apmc can not purchase corp from farmer below msp make healthy auction set base price for corp that msp then who have power they will buy from farmer will create open competitive market for buyer and also fair mechanism for poor farmer
be actually nothing just anger of farmer use with wrong intention by other political party

msp should be extend for private buyer too only then farmer can hope for some profit
this enactment basically can alter intend purpose of msp which provide safety net and can make msp a price floor such intervention can deleterious for agricultural sector a put up price floor reduce quantity demand significantly buyer of produce of farmer will not be interested buy at such high price regardless of how much farmer would like sell low quantity of produce will be purchase this further create obligation over government purchase all produce at msp price a demand kill by such price floor in place hence pump fiscal deficit such move will effectively away chunk of total surplus of producer and seller and will be against free market work
7 18 that true and thats reason why farmer in bihar in extremely poor condition
i always support farmer
these factor will help farmer produce natural crop and will save ecological balance
nice informative video but leave without conclusion 1 new farm bill well or bad for country who will lose who will gain please add this last part thnx
so in conclusion this protest have nothing do with farm bill but something that punjab want for past several year and that their own rule and own country punjab either need learn reform or india need find other channel govt should not be force pay for poor quality product just because of set minimum if company run show they wouldve have do thing correctly and thats what these farmer all fear inability cut corner
goverment decide that only low income farmer get benefit of msp so poor farmer first get benefit of this
i always support farmer and i will support farmer that
this law be good be farmer a say have nothing do with msp mean they can sell at msp in mandi but everyone want politics
1 farmer produce trade and commerce act 1 freedom of choice of sale and purchase eg outside mandis 2 barrier free inter and intra state trade 3 no need pay ce and levy 4 electronic trading transparency and tine save 5 direct trading at farm gate cold storage process unit etc 6 elimination of middleman 7 clarification by govt msp system and mandis will continue

new farm bill more vulnerable monopoly atleast when know that there no limit on hoard when there should be also like say that product perishable in nature hoard only help them exploit producer farmer even more for eg product with msp of r 100 for once purchase at r 120 result in maximum produce and sale let say twice actual demand remain produce can be hoard and in next season trader buyer can either refuse buy new product or ask them farmer sell same product at half price because of their perishable nature farmer would not have other option but agree also potential player will be very limited and open market say just gimmick because in begin product will be purchase at lucrative price which have never be offer earlier at price which can not be pay by others even with take huge loss on account of buyer kill potential competition like happen in case of jio even idea and vodafone fail survive which other buyer can loss as much a adani in agriculture sector anyone and then when competition dead there no msp protect farmer interest mandis will close down eventually a they d largely remain non functional because of good deal from pvt buyer in begin like happen with bsnl we already have see such market disaster in recent time do not we learn anything from how can farmer survive exploitative monopoly which even idea and vodafone could not survive apmcs atleast in interest of farmer new farm bill actually make producer farmer most vulnerable in apmcs trader license give those who close state govts and govts change keep cycle run open market with no law for msp unlimited hoarding and with giant like adani just delusional expect fair business take place even in open market this monopoly bad by 100 mile when compare conventional system of apmcs

think of a any other industry let say scooter in india it completely private million of indian people need scooter and continue buy from handful of company technically they could form cartel and raise price together make massive impact in indian marketplace but do that really happen no because free market also encourage competition and especially in today day and age if 10 company come together and raise price new company will get set up see discrepancy in margin pricing that they can advantage off of simultaneously if they price artificially low lure more and more people buy scooter they will have low margin and b once demand pick up there will be more raw material require up with demand which would put pressure on raw material resource and drive price back up again else will not be sustainable for company begin with and they will go bankrupt if they continue sell scooter at low price than what they can sustain
corporates will buy crop and store them but essential commodity act will stop them for store crop for long time a increase price in market

but must need understand why only haryana and punjab when there 2 cr farmer in uttar pradesh and 10 lac only in punjab
great way of explanation but i have one doubt if msp legalise than consider if more farmer grow wheat and in market surplus of wheat and consumer still have buy at high price govt ca not fix price price fix by market self definitely govt need control cartel and corporate interference
no doubt hr community mulak chahye i be very very thankful my allah that i be pakistani and i be muslim rajput belong from india kernal
but reality of government control mandi that poor farmer usually force sell at whatever price broker cartel at mandi decides msp usually come when government procure directly through fci etc for perishable item like brinjal lemon etc force sell because can not produce back home
i do not understand small farmer will be screw how do not have logistics fund get out of state and sell crop

respect shekhar gupta sir i be great admirer of your journalism and have be follow your work from day of kaar seva when i be just ager sir with due respect i beg differ from somehow when say that bjp have lose this battle on contrary my view that if anything bjp have succeed in so far strategy of counter anti farm law agitation and i find this answer in your statement of this episode i agree with completely that his agitation no more about farm law but now purely politics and i have my doubt that political pundit who decide bjp strategy would not have ponder on point that give leverage of 18 month halt period could affect their upcoming election in up and elsewere especially if we all know now that just politics about this agitation what i mean say that government know very well leader of this agitation will not accept condition of 18 month postponement of implementation of law and they float this offer with utmost care keep all outcome in view and by not accept offer farmer leader have actually fall into trap i also have impression this strategy of bjp can even sow seed of disagreement among farmer leader though that just guess feel
i support farmer

what many people dont understand 1 central govt do not have budgetary resource buy entire product of all farmer around india that why they do not want make law otherwise they will be bind buy everything economically and fiscally this impossible 2 apmc mandis strongly cartelised mean only few people can buy from there becoz get license very difficult and cost lot 5lacs so these trader buy produce at low price eventually hurt farmer also small farmer do not have money their produce by tractor mandi pay tax and storage cost till produce sell by legitimise outside mandi sale this will help them legally sell outside mandi farm law have be in implementation in rashtra for over decade and now and mandis still intact 3 conflict resolution problem genuine this something that govt should consider 4 repeal of essential commodity act will benefit trader who will now want buy produce sell at high price without govt intervention even if we imagine that this will lead steep price will not lead many people begin trade sell at slightly low price than competition be at profit this will ultimately ensure correct price this basically essence of market economics i e promote efficiency through competition and self interest

why in progressive state like maharashtra farmer r not part of agitation
2 20 i would like point out that govt will not need out apmc brick by brick sir issue here that corporates have certain financial backing with which they can provide price slightly hire than apmc for couple of year 3 4 year let assume farmer will therefore sell these corporates at high price and no procurement will occur through mandis this will effectively drain mandis of mandi tax and mandis will eventually fall into ruin by themselves in 5th year when corporate silo will be already full due excess procurement in previous year farm production of wheat paddy have always be great than consumption for many year now corporates may choose not buy at all or buy at very low price and option of mandis at that point in time may not be available at all i hope this get point across
i think these all so call farmer leader traitor central government should very strict action against these low life traitor

sir i be great fan of cut clutter and follow avidly your analysis of international geopolitics however your analysis of agricultural economy in context of ongoing farmer protest leave me unconvinced in my perhaps simplistic view imbalance in agricultural production rice and wheat versus oilseed for example can be correct simply by rebalancing procurement price disservice farmer in bihar due low price availability of foodgrain procure in punjab and haryana seem be matter of bihar have abolish apmc act and not give it farmer incentive available farmer in punjab and haryana why can not government simply increase procurement price for oilseed maize etc and reduce them proportionately for rice and wheat why do we need new law and open door for ambanis and adanis into agriculture why can not fci simply export excess foodgrain rather than allow them rot in open storage why must we allow ambani adani crony capitalism into agriculture when absence of big business do not prevent from get out of cycle of famine and become self sufficient in food do not get answer these question from this episode clutter be not cut
problem only 2 state be follow msp properly so farmer over there have problem but they still have option continue with same just farmer who do not want sell in maandi they can move out and find other option

however discuss only flaw of various apmc act and exist practice not how new bill will resolve these issue except few do not discuss about new bill for agreement between farmer and sponsor how dispute among them will be resolve what will be power of court in this regard what if sdm unbiased or his decision otherwise prejudice farmer what if produce will not match quality grade standard criteria inspection will be do by sponsor and they can reject price can be vary and corporates smart than innocent farmer and they may undue advantage of section 5 bargain power of big corporates may induce individual farmer sell their produce at low price no other central law prohibits corporates can now stock huge in their cold storage and sell later at high price
simple solution solve problem for grain storage would be that farmer can form their own regional cooperative like amul will reduce financial burden on government and at same time empower farmer concept of msp on all crop not feasible will increase fiscal burden on government

a for central government perception this act may root out all concern of indian farmer and i wish good luck but my concern on execution strength of government especially central government because reform by modi government become curse people of india in every aspect for example note ban by government become grave small scale industry even after completion of 4 year bad impact of that decision not come down due that decision unemployment rate reach mountain level in our country same thing in matter of gst also our constitution always take about decentralisation of everything but due gst in financial matter central government become iron hand and now state become minority share holder in financial spectram of our country same thing happen in lockdown issue also we all feel be shame after watch such painful visuals of migrant people here my question and concern that whether central government creat any platform perform this act without mistkes if this act become one more failure act india will witness very painful situvation before make these kind of law center go one piolet project in particular state and find out result and make any correction which need implement all over country with out have any ground work they think implement never be good because strength of this government not up mark in implementing of these kind of act most of indian face bitter experience due act of this central government
i concern that medium and these liberal drag india back dark time of congress rule sad see indian will never become like united state or west where they embrace meritocracy capitalism and low corruption look like india go back congress rule and back 2000s era policy and politics of dynasty rule and nepotism thank medium and delusional liberal thank

modi govt should this farm bill soon
2 lack of crop diversity and support industry india surplus producer of stuff like rice and wheat we just produce too much of while we end up import some other major crop like pulse now somewhat of side effect i can say a government give msp guarantee on rice and wheat in lot instance which make artificially more profitable grow than other crop even though should have be other way round where price on rice and wheat should have go down if supply too high and discourage farmer grow them and grow something where there demand for or else just waste of food money soil and effort now i do know issue with this a farmer fear leave stable and safe source for something where they end up make less so i feel government should introduce some sort of float msp system where msp will be set accord demand and supply
why be so many farmer against this i think cut out middleman mean farmer would have be pay more

do farmer really watch parliamentary debate do any meaningful discussion ever happen during parliamentary debate opposition would not have agree even if there be lengthy discussion in end would have come vote in parliament on law and majority would get their way also by your logic government should consult everyone on income tax defence relate law this way we will never be able pas any law one should either believe in democracy or not once government choose by majority one must allow them operate rather than blockade city
great analysis so prove that apmc not work because of it flaw and farmer mostly sell their produce outside mandis below msp in cash transaction new act will mess up income of state government hamper development

thankuuuuuu soooo much for understand problem of our farmer
3 4 bjp worker have also die india best bias channel
regard msp we can not compare any electronic or other good wth agricultural product since dayby day will perish and who will buy any spoiled or perished thing rice even produce frm single land will not be of same quality so if there hundred kg seventy will get good price and for remain price will be low some time at time of harvest rain may come or lot of problem which can affect quality and price more than that since india member of wto corporates have choice buy low cost food crop frm other country and central govt spending billion of rupee every year in agriculture sector through various subsidy and scheme and in newspaper we can check price of crop daily pls check

now tell me one thing let example of bihar where apmc have be abolish in 2006 but if see income growth of bihar farmer 0 8 so not clear this bill will not do any magic a such alone
and no government have even able significantly create job where farm community can be wean out of farm which become more more poorer a 86 5 of farmer have less than 1 5 acre of land and this hold continuously reduce can see exodus of farmer abroad from punjab where this major reason although some big farmer also emigrate due quality of life abroad however majority emigrate a farm not viable and there no suitable white collar job available elsewhere

law on paper by and large good with few exception like not mention msp on paper or no access court but benefit of this level of privatisation usually limit those who already well establish and have capacity advantage of benefit poor farmer may not be able do so give high level of poverty in country especially in rural area we can not completely do away with government support

big farmer of punjab and haryana who sell at msp fci in these mandis thinking and force think by politician that in future govt may stop procuring at msp but ordinance do not say this at all of wheat and rice and if price fluctuates on low side then they may loose because then they have sell private trader but why not other farmer of india protest answer msp announce for all over india for 25 crop but since 1965 when fci get establish fci have procure only wheat and rice and mainly from these two state punjab and haryana and certain level from mp rajasthan chattisgarh also but mostly punjab and haryana farmer trader commission agent govt have benefit till now and who have lose 135 crore indian all other state farmer

disappoint by incorrect cooverage of farm protest modi govt try setup parallel system for crop procurement slowly and gradually they will eliminate msp then how will ensure that kissans get right price for their crop moreover small farmer do not have money or resource fight big company in court in case of contract violation in that case mist of them will end of lose their lifetime saving if company reject their crop base on quality issue
why only punjab farmer why not farmer in south india and other state protest this look all politically motivate
state government should provide msp mpp min purchase price for all crop grow in their region or they should list out minimum purchase price for crop from farmer for contractual farm all crop regardless of their grow size should have fix msp mpp price detail out every year by local state government when there agricultural ministry in place and people sit there work for benefit of country i be sure they surely can come out with what fair price for each crop in every season depend upon market and region i be still not sure what prevent govt in decide msps let say they not in position provide msp mpp right away this year due lack of infrastructure storage then they should obviously be compel build such infrastructure at rate that they can confirm msp would be applicable from that date onwards and so would be law
now for each one of patriot of india stand with pm narendra modi in this hour where fight 2 5 war rather than go ballistic against him and defeat his effort in neutralize 0 5 war with enemy within include lobby judge occupy sizeable seat in supreme court

3 industrialization may not be agriculture itself but can surely improve life of lot of people who be in farm previously as will create job opportunity for million come out of agriculture and shift into comparatively high value manufacturing a service sector legendary bad at provide enough job opportunity especially population as large a ours i hope can relate india and agriculture though extremely important for life very bad a source of livelihood so we should focus at try improve productivity of farmer so that less and less farmer can also fee nation and shift rest into comparatively high value manufacturing industry

central government should listen farmer
why sometimes onion become more than 100 per kilo and other vegetable at more than 50 per kilo simply logic of apmc do not stand msp here stay and violent agitation on some hypothetical assumption not acceptable thitrd why other state not forthcoming with agitation fourth punjab and haryana in grip of organize syndicate of big farmer and since they adversely affect they resort such violent agitation

go wrong with farmer
i know that this farm bill issue not black or white but entirely grey thanks for cover i would like show this my friend
your discussion be not only illuminate but also inspire three farm law a on today stand scrap have endorse my hunch that agitation basically engineer by rich farmer and middleman especially from punjab and haryana miss one point that kerala essentially socialist state never legislate apmc act hence farmer do not have offer their produce at designated marketplace license middleman one reason could have be kerala be not into subsistence farming of paddy other reason be must have be political which that entire focus of support farmer be farmer of punjab and haryana may be because people who represent farming interest at centre be basically from these two state so economic and political focus of green revolution be centre on these two state i would say partisan approach national issue if farmer from other state be similarly engage there be no reason why they could not have rise occasion again there no reason why 88 and 70 of national procurement of paddy and wheat should happen from punjab and haryana time centre distribute it procurement more equitably among all indian state this will immensely benefit punjab and haryana a their farmer will shift focus other crop thereby reduce ecological burden on these state of grow rice and wheat
if govt withdraw farm law what next what takait goon plan for improvement of farmer plan new storage facility new market new crop new connectivity new method of disburse payment they go give up subsidy fertilizer electricty
not every farmer happy with this decision shame on pn and haryana farmer

withdrawal of 3 farmer amendment act not lose bhagawan shri modi ji and his government but that all most all lose small or big farmer of india dark soul give disturbance government of india by name of true saint farmer market
also many people comment on how this bill will away there right go court in case of dispute but truth this bill provide proper legal framework that be create protect farmer of india and not big private company
informative video but why do not mention issue of minimum support price if commodity remove from essential commodity list will company not be at liberty push down buying price of these commodity break point purchase them from farmer at low price possible company may then sell these commodity at increase price in market but that do not necessarily mean that farmer will earn more
almost everyone say open up market good look like farmer also not concern about but they more worried abt msp chance of deal with big corporates possible disruption of exist system sell their produce and hence temporary difficulty they might face logically open up best way get everyone involve fair deal but just open without proper support system only go favor big corporates bcs they well inform and always prepare there should be support system for guide farmer from switch from wheat others or help them in deal with big corporates also government should facilitate start ups with innovative idea revolutionize farm like use technology and focus should be in those area while open up rather than help corporates with money and muscle power find new blue ocean government stubbornness and rush probably make farmer suspicious reliance acquire big bazar tata buying big basket and it hard believe these just coincidence so if someone have doubt on these reform they not unfounded

drishti ia youtube channel which go through detail analysis of farm bill 3 hr vedio and bill suggest that farmer can cell there produce mandi and also decide cost of produce
great video thx so consensus i can arrive at base on this information this farm bill not comprehensive and lack application of thought my thought simply this if today with all tech and knowledge and experience we have gain we can not care of farmer and bring down price on essential and non essential item depress and really sad i have great expectation from this govt i sincerely hope we a nation work towards solve all gap and redraft this make more comprehensive ensure corporates dont play with 50 and 100 which i guarantee that any company will do far i dont see how this will stop hoarding in our country where our judicial system forever resolve case how much peace will bring farmer most of who have not be able get even basic education busy feed our country have legal contract i dont see this solution problem face today if anything seem only make big mess

sabko pta these chanel godi medium republic tv aajtak abp india today zee news 18 tv9 etc
totally acceptable if farmer do protest for something if they do not like about government
i believe this wise move by bjp and pm modi i would encourage government go far one step and repeal all subsidy that in actual fact benefit middle man and unscrupulous landlord let each individual state sort their own subsidy for their farmer in absence of reform let see how long these farmer want continue with their stupidity and opposition when their pocket book start really hurt furthermore unfair for rest of country foot subsidy bill for state that oppose farm reform bill who think they know good how run their farming industry all state that support farm reform bill should be encourage enact law for their state formalise new law and look towards create common market union among these state for benefit of their farmer
people should be wise while voting because what speak today if same thought be think almost one year back about farmer there would not have be so many death among farmer now reason forthcoming election farmer as well a other citizen must be very careful in voting and select their leader one should not believe in floral speech floral speech give when something behind we pray that god bless our country citizens with god wisdom and not human wisdom after so many farmer be kill wife lose their husband husband lose their wife child lose their father and mother how can leader of our country replace these loss and forget all these thing give such floral speech will not help people god bless our country

thanks thanks lot medium for represent farmer worldwide please cover all footage of farmer protest
glad u be not bias on your we just need unbiased news in these time if there proper regulation of this with farmer not be advantage of then i tnk farmer will be hugely benefit by this bill
one big problem with bjp that they expect too much sacrifice from mass demonetization motor vehicle amendment act raise fine compulsory fastags fuel price etc etc i would be comfortable if there equal sacrifice by rule elite but their perk increase 6th 7th pay commission increase sarkari salary without any substantial increase in productivity
farm lose making business for farmer if they will not get proper selling price then all farmer will quit do farm then what will eat
now farmer terrorist wah modi wah
2 new design will eventually replace arhtiyas middleman with corporation farmer esp small farmer have some say in negotiation with middleman because of social and local political factor they can work with local sarpanch mlas etc who have benefit in help local farmer in case of corporation do think small farmer can fight court case when corporation promise 50 r kg for onion before sow but give only 5 r kg after cultivation cite factor like it too much moisture not good quality etc etc
i support farmer protest i also support caa protest they all work a star pracharak event for modi and bjp because these protest create strong feeling of nationalism among common people which normally remain dormant of india and make bjp strong these protest also work as filter that clearly separate out who for country and who against
well explain reform look good in paper but open up market private player do not guarantee and smooth transaction issue of apmc price management can also pop up when big private corps step in similarly misuse in contract farming can also be suppressive farmer farm law arnt perfect however they could have be sent parliamentary stand committee before be pass hastily without in depth expert input
modi have stick with some of his tough position demonetization and lockdown be most criticize i do not believe that need back off for political game up strong under yogi there something else happen in punjab and we really should wait until dust settle there no need try and analyze with such knee jerk reaction aim i believe anti modi but do have any alternative

regard third one amendment of essential commodity act 1955 will not have negative side effect of allow company buy large quantity of something and hoard and then once they have very large quantity store up they can essentially control price and sell

anonymous official we in state where slavery have be accept wholesale and there people who believe that rule class have legitimate moral right rule and other people legitimately their slave this really where we at in humanity worldwide and vast majority of people have accept that paradigm and what cult religious belief system that completely false completely erroneous there not enough people speak out encourage that that false paradigm and belief system this what message that we have put out there this body of population that still believe mainstream medium narrative and still believe government narrative believe in authority condone slavery that exactly what stop sugarcoating and start say what other people believe in authority condone slavery if believer in authority and believer that there moral legitimacy government someone who say i believe in and condone slavery because that what right command and rule other people slavery and that what government on it face and i will not sugarcoat that that what i here put that out there a plain and simple truth and encourage others do same there no such thing a right rule or command others we have stop believing that there because even believe condone slavery and completely immoral and completely base on violence so now what happen that narrative of this master class be say never be question not be question by member of slave class this what all this social sham all about by member of cult see cult member want point finger at other people who do not believe their worldview of authority their authoritative authoritarian worldview know they want say shame on no not shame on shame on for accept that slavery morally legitimate how about that that how table have be turn your worldview false and illegitimate morally on it face and now big tech company big tech corporation try make impossible get word out by censor social medium and censor people and deplatforming them and all that gon na do insight very very dark day ahead let just say already turn in that direction because of how people have be oppress and people do not understand what powder keg not just powder keg here in america folk powder keg worldwide and good psychologically prepare yourself and i tell everybody out there too because most people who say they for truth and for freedom do not do their work they fail at their job morally educate public there not enough of voice of truth reality speak into existence lady and gentleman universe have speak into existence what we experience in our daily reality in aggregate in collective base upon what people say what people accept into them information they take in and that what inform their behavior and now what rule class want do try make impossible get that word out there and they go ensure violent outcome a result of that that what i have be try prevent from day one and that what i have be try tell my viewership and listenership that your personal responsibility through your action help prevent by teach people true morality and unfortunately we fail in that job collectively we fail in that job and go see result of that failure in physical world these people believe that all alternative viewpoint of reality perspective of reality be ban and banish and even possibly make illegal okay people who do not accept their worldview a put out there by mainstream medium and government and other official or expert not be challenge and they have their right strip from them if they do not accept that worldview well i do not accept your worldview i believe my knowledge far superior yours and i not afraid tell that real reality of this no one have right force worldview upon others we have right speak what truth i can not ultimately force on anybody i could just show ignorant person how they have be deceive but just like i can not force my worldview on other people no one can force their worldview on me or others because here truth of matter folk government medium and even scientist not arbiter of truth truth exist independently of any human be perception of our goal bring our perception into alignment with that which namely truth and we have do that through rigid truth discovery psychology and take in high volume of eclectic information from all over many different source even those we do not agree with put them all together logically weed out all inconsistency so that we distill down base essence of that which true and only then can we say we have accurate understanding of what take place and most people do not do that process lady and gentleman i do do that process and i not go have people that do not do tell me what i must believe because expert say i will perform truth discovery methodology process on information myself and come my own conclusion about and so should everyone else so no one gon na tell me other people arbiter of truth no one arbiter of truth not even me not not anyone a individual their conclusion do not mean that truth and their conclusion can not be violently push upon others that what unfortunately take place in our world people with no knowledge just completely give into fear and big fear fear of unknown because fear of unknown what hold people back from knowledge and high awareness see if fear knowledge because fear what might discover go create feedback loop of fear because fear come from lack of knowledge those who inform not in fear ignorance what create fear refusal of truth what create fear i have no such fear because i have accept what truth and i have align my perception but here where we at folk societally this what self mastery all about understand law of universe understand natural law and then actually apply that true spirituality in one life through our behavior through our action in right way through right action next way out self respect true respect true look again at quality of ourself a individual self respect true healer want cure real human sickness then apply true healer which self respect first and foremost this development of internal courage look at truth and then speak truth publicly not just your family and friend where think safe need be out there publicly in courageous way where tell people i not afraid know turn off lie fearmongering state control medium affront self respect stop believing that others have right command there no such right there no such moral right this way out true courage courage universe protection universal protection we talk about know protective equipment know shield from illness this real universal protection shield from spiritual illness that what courage be bold and mighty force will come your aid people who step up people who say no we not go have this we gon na go back our life we not gon na government mandate we not gon na government command because do not have right command we free and we gon na act like know step into that kind of courage creates universe protection i protect because i not afraid i not afraid of what can be do me in physical domain and know what real protection go come in form of step into courage teach natural law that spiritual understanding if exercise courage for right thing and teach right thing and teach natural law mighty force of creation will come your assistance and aid in your life in all your endeavor and that where my protection come from so we have say lose word which no and we need fall in love with this lose word we have say no evil we have say no authoritarianism we have say no worldview violence we have say no external control no one have right

2 third bill intention be bring third party organization into farming and protect farmer from famine and other natural disaster while also increase diversity of agricultural product which currently very limited due lack of certainty in post harvesting income look at how much wheat production increase in up mp and punjab and how mp recently cross 300 mt of wheat production in year 20 21 which get waste due very poor storage facility so clarity would come from proper dialogue with farmer and curb weak area of law make them legible and clearer which i think goi try up some extent but we all saw what exactly happen if implementation of these bill have be effective with proper clarity then would have make farmer more confident and secure so they could have start think toward other farming option and process and may eventually shift towards organic farming as well
