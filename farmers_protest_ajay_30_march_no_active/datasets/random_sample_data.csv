"Since when did a free market become a bad thing?  Farmers in India shy away from growing organic produce and choose to grow sub-standard GMO crops because of MSP. Since they know the quality is of no relevance, any quality is supported by the government promised minimum support price. A free market leads to competition amongst producers, better investments in products which are relevant to market demand (take the example of avocado across the world), sustainable profitability for producer and also better quality product at a better price for the consumer. A product like rice cannot be monopolized by a large corporate, because if that is true then Amul has already monopolized the milk industry in India. Are the milk producers getting fair value for their product? Yes, because if Amul won't pay the local producers a fair price someone else will, or the milk producers will sell directly to the customer, which they do even now.

And no government has. Even able to significantly create jobs where the farming community can be weaned out of farming which is becoming more & more poorer as 86.5% of the farmers have less than 1.5 acre of land and this holding is continuously reducing. You can see the exodus of farmers abroad from Punjab where this is a major reason although some bigger farmers also emigrate due to the quality of life abroad. However majority emigrate as farming is not viable and there are no suitable white collar jobs available elsewhere.,and no government have even able significantly create job where farm community can be wean out of farm which become more more poorer a 86 5 of farmer have less than 1 5 acre of land and this hold continuously reduce can see exodus of farmer abroad from punjab where this major reason although some big farmer also emigrate due quality of life abroad however majority emigrate a farm not viable and there no suitable white collar job available elsewhere,0
"Mr Shekhar, you have very well explained the Paddy and Rice situation in Punjab and Haryana. Thanks for that. I have visited hundreds of Apmc mandis in India and found that hardly small and marginal farmers get the benefits of Mandi system. It is the big farmers get all the benefits and do all dirty politics.

They are also conniving with traders to all kinds of manipulation so that easy money will be there for them. That's why the big farmers Who are also politicians in association with traders and commission agents creating all these problem. Further if you do research you will find that the so called farmer organisations and their leaders do not want farmers to be independent and well of because if farmers get benefits, their leadership will be at stake. These people never tried to motivate the farmers to go for diversification about productive utilisation of water and energy. They misinformed the farmers. Look at the people at dharna place, mostly farmers from Punjab are found. Does it mean that rest of the country farmers are not there?

"Main reason for protest IMHO is the way the bills/ordinance/law was pushed through. The closest analogy I can think of is if someone barges into a house with a suitcase  that he claims are goodies for the occupants, any occupant would ask him to take his goodies and get out. If the intruder says, I will not open the suitcase but leave it her unopened for 18 months, the occupants would still say get out. How many of us have had the experience where someone barges is without knocking, maybe with something official or legal. We would insist the person get out, knock and walk in only after you give permission. In such circumstances (if its true) nothing else but repealing the laws will work. And the longer the inevitable is prolonged, the more the risk of something flaring up and things going beyond everybody's control. And also the more it is prolonged, it only makes the opposition stronger.",reason for protest imho way bill ordinance law be push through close analogy i can think of if someone barge into house with suitcase that claim goody for occupant any occupant would ask him his goody and get out if intruder say i will not open suitcase but leave her unopened for 18 month occupant would still say get out how many of have have experience where someone barge without knock maybe with something official or legal we would insist person get out knock and walk in only after give permission in such circumstance if it true nothing else but repeal law will work and longer inevitable prolong more risk of something flare up and thing go beyond everybody control and also more prolonged only make opposition stronger,1

At the end of the day, if the reform hurts the richest category of farmers marginally in the short run, while increasing the options for the most marginal category of farmers, then it comes down to who do you support in this scenario.",i personally have just one issue with this analysis which treat word farmer a homogeneous group i believe all analysis on farmer issue will become much more nuanced once we start categorise different type of farmer base on their landholding mechanisation labour employ etc status quo definitely benefit some stakeholder otherwise would not have exist and any reform will hurt this category at end of day if reform hurt rich category of farmer marginally in short run while increase option for most marginal category of farmer then come down who do support in this scenario,0

2. The price of the commodities even now is not government regulated. Government intervenes only if the prices go too high or too low. In order not to let either of the parties incur the loss. And farmers are not always going to sell or selling at loss. Only in certain situations they are. However government clarified that MSP will not be removed which means the farmer is always protected. He can sell in APMC if there's steep fall else he can earn more in the open market. ,2 price of commodity even now not government regulate government intervenes only if price go too high or too low in order not let either of party incur loss and farmer not always go sell or selling at loss only in certain situation they however government clarify that msp will not be remove which mean farmer always protect can sell in apmc if there steep fall else can earn more in open market,0

"BJP and Congress both have expressed the issues with 'APMC' mandi having lots of issues. Kerala n many other states do not use the Mandi. Rice grower of Kerala are not protesting. The projected roles of Adatiya being glorified by this lady. Why is this protest , since the large growers of wheat do not know the tax payer money of 33000 crores , which was coming to the states, what will happen ? Govt has been buying the wheat , its reaching the PDS shops via APMC and not that all the goods sold is class 'A'. In fact the PDS ration shop wheat is not palatable by a common man.  This means a good grower of wheat lets say 100 quintals , in reality is selling 200 quintals in APMC ( out of which 100 is stones and not real wheat ). Then the money related to this wheat , goes to middlemen and farmers.  Ashirvad atta company or similar ones do not buy this wheat.  When farmer dumps his wheat in APMC mandi , who finally buys it from there and where does the wheat gets utilised , has the real answers for this protest.  Why does Govt still imports despite bumper crop ( or farmer does not export ) , if he has done excellent quality and has a fear of the price drop. ??? Few questions are based on fears. These are away from reality...On ground , the news channel should visit APMC ware houses and show the pictures of rats and rotten wheat laying , lack of disposal in time and usage. That will clear all the muck. The channels are not spending time to show real ware house conditions.",bjp and congress both have express issue with apmc mandi have lot of issue kerala n many other state do not use mandi rice grower of kerala not protest project role of adatiya be glorify by this lady why this protest since large grower of wheat do not know tax payer money of 33000 crore which be come state what will happen govt have be buy wheat it reach pds shop apmc and not that all good sell class in fact pds ration shop wheat not palatable by common man this mean good grower of wheat let say 100 quintal in reality selling 200 quintal in apmc out of which 100 stone and not real wheat then money relate this wheat go middleman and farmer ashirvad atta company or similar one do not buy this wheat when farmer dump his wheat in apmc mandi who finally buy from there and where do wheat get utilise have real answer for this protest why do govt still import despite bumper crop or farmer do not export if have do excellent quality and have fear of price drop few question base on fear these away from reality on ground news channel should visit apmc ware house and show picture of rat and rotten wheat lay lack of disposal in time and usage that will clear all muck channel not spend time show real ware house condition,0
