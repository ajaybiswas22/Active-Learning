hi brother appreciate your effort to make a video on this socially relevant issue let me put forward my understanding on this matter basically you be talk about organise v unorganised farmer class practically farm sector be still unorganised in our country right now and it be control by middleman with the help of corrupt politician so the new bill or law be not go to change the scenario secondly base support price be currently benefit less than 6 of farmer in our country and the scenario be not go to change unless farmer opt out of apmc set up thirdly and finally the main drawback of the new bill be discuss be lack of awareness knowledge and expertise of farmer in deal with the marketing of their product outside the region in my understanding we should not underestimate farmer on utilise technology with the help of digital platform they can tackle this and government already start program to educate farmer initial stage there will be some issue but they will get adjusted soon during digital india proposal opposer be tell this drawback but now even the road side vendor be utilising digital platform like upi for business how fresh to home online food delivery group train the fisherman for use technology be also a classical example in this regard

vox your interpretation of the first act be completely wrong firstly the mandis and msp be not go away they will continue to exist so a farmer if he choose too can continue to sell his produce in the mandis but this amendment allow the farmer again if he choose too to sell his produce directly to the corporation at a price agree upon by both party without have to pay any intermediary price determine by supply and demand if the farmer be not happy with the agreement before sign the contract he can go back to the mandis so at 05 07 when you say player in the regulated market be bind to move out those player be the farmer and bound to move out be them make the conscientious decision to sell directly to the corporation again by there own volition if the mandis be beneficial they will continue to exist if not they will vanish that be how life work

i love your talk i love your lecture and that be why i be make this first comment here but this lecture seem to be one of the biased talk by you lean towards the government rather be value neutral in term of the content of law for example since 1975 there be no restriction on a farmer to sell their product in the mandi they can sell it anywhere the restriction be on the trader however you say that be the case for the farmer also the case where apmc be not there also your point about the free market seem to be argue that free market will directly benefit the farmer and will take away the middle man however remove the regulation on the amount that can be store you be actually create the middleman inform of big industry particularly that can export good there seem to be quite a few gap in this lecture and i would like to request from you your take now that the government have take back these law furthermore in the start you give example of thing become status quo and just because something becomes status quo it do not mean that it be well than the previous status quo through your lecture it seem like you do not highlight the inherent bias of the government you assume again that government be neutral towards farmer and industrialist alike we know in the real world be not and can never be the case
u forget to mention a very basic point of msp disadvantage if there be no msp price will be determine by demand and supply obviously monopoly will be create by big corporates only in short term farmer will get so called fair price it will be bad than before in future
you make this video onesider you show people both side of the new law you only show this video only positive nt negative
full support my all farmer brother
9 minimum price should be mention in contract farming agreement even if a quality issue in future
head weight modi definitely he get punishment from the god

kissan the real hero
there be chance of debt trap small farmer by the big company and ultimately they buy that land and make them work on the land for lease this will be one of the drawback
modi mostly take wrong decision and implementation of all the decision be bad india have suffer badly from modi decision eg notebandi gst lockdown mismanagement ujjawala and agri rule and many more
news ta da dinde niche comment v pdh lya kar
so to boil this whole thing in simplest possible form indian farmer do not want to set their own price with capitalistic system instead they want to let other people set their price if they can organize protest this size i think they can organize some sort of consensus on minimum and high price what come to their produce
watch the channel the deshbhakt he you will not regret he always appreciate govt decision and criticise it equally not like dhruv who be hear to criticise the country
sorry modi ji sunn nahi sakte bol nahi sakte aur dekh bhi nahi sakte individual be not bad or corrupt the love for the chair have absolute power make you bad or corrupt even raavan great devotee of lord shiva could not resist the power he be only a man why would he listen see or speak

jay mere desh ke kishan you be real god
i think it bite difficult for example my family be from bihar which be one of the poor state in india these new farm law can literally make our annual income from crop twice like right now my family be cultivate cauliflower and if these farm law be in place we would earn almost 5 6 time on this crop itself but if u r a rich farmer or from a rich state like punjab or haryana then yeah these law can decrease ur income and security quite a lot in simpler term these law giver poor state more opportunity and money and all that money and opportunity be be take from rich state like punjab and harayan thats why farmer of these state be they only one protest it in a way it kinda like socialism
not victory it be faliure for farmer
i hope farmer be not cheat and they get their honest share for all the hardwork and effort they have be put all these year
save farmer save india
3 in the video it be already mention that cartelization and team up happens in apmc market today so what be the sense in continue with the same system and support more middle men who do not let the farmer get the worth of their hard work toil
people say punjab and tamil nadu and two very opposite state
india be too emotional of a country to progress east asia be willing to knuckle down and absorb pain for advancement indian feel entitle to everything these farmer believe government must guarantee them a livelihood it a terrible message to show that protest will lead to result violent protest must be crush incentive matter yet india only reward bad behaviour mughals can knock down temple while hindu can not attain it back through democratic process but caa get stop by protest

pm modi ji you be right but farmer insurance open to kro
farmer protest very peacefully for a long period but government do not heed to their need many farmer die due to the cold weather condition
most simple and unbiased explanation about the farm bill
these bill be not for farmer empowerment
and government be not go to remove mandis they be simply give farmer a choice wether they could sell it in mandis or to private corporation or to simply go in another state to sell it a the current law forbids them to sell their crop in another state of to a person who have not receive a permit from the state government
be there any comodities on which there be a restriction on sell their comodities like mobile shoe vehicals
well do on your incomplete research there be in fact regulation even outside of apmc under the consumer court regime and sub divisional magistrate there anyways wasnt any regulation in the apmcs it just stop small and low income farmer from go out to good deal out side of the apmcs wither private mandis or other state not necessarily corporates and the fact that they will now be able to sell in all other state not just limit to their own open up huge opportunity for growth out of the 631 farmer union in india only 35 be protest and 12 be openly politically align with a party if they be so bad why would the top agricultural economist in india along with those all the way at the imf support the law farmer union in rest of the state have give their support to the farmer already and just a small minority of farmer protest in one corner of the country do not speak for the entire community
who will answer to other part of country except haryana and punjab it be win of punjab and haryana farmer over other state it be a injustice for other state
again we can not even buy a bike how can we store our crop and where this will the private company like adani and ambani who already have open cold store at a number of destination
central govt be just greedy to earn money a tax from these all big fish in the name of welfare of farmer
ideally the medium should focus on whether the bill be anti farmer and how not the type of report that can be use a a propaganda by incite sympathy ask these protester what the bill exactly stand for and not even 1 of them will exactly know what they stand on be the protestors also give feedback to leader a to how they should act when the govt be negotiate with them so willfully i think communist leader be work in their own self interest and propaganda in govt negotiation
congratulation farmer
damn that mean about 1 out of 12 human be an indian farmer
never see such clean hearted leader who do not have ego even after in country most powerful position i imagine sometimes how good it will be to live in india if everyone like him
and there be indeed few element who be try to use these protest for their own nefarious agenda search the video of yograj singh who come here to support farmer
guy i may not know 100 but yeh protest bahut hadd tak politically design h jo mandi ka tax h vo state govt ko jata h

which be still worthy of outrage but let be outrage over the truth and not over propaganda
2 the essential commodity act amendment bill it empower the central government to regulate food item in extraordinary circumstance or impose stock limit if there be a steep price rise however the point of contention be

lol good work in make the video guess there certain point in the bill which definitely need amendment match with the point raise by it make thing a bit more clear why it need amendment there must be some msp a a legal right whenever they be open up market it be a very valid point to stop corporate monopoly how much that msp must be be debatable it can be low than current msp but there must be a legal implement msp otherwise there can definitely be a monopoly be always a supporter for this govt but in this case it need to act quickly and resolve the matter soon instead of any delay result in loss for vote
dear these three act be not in favour of farmer you be focus only outline of these act but on other hand there be many adverse affect on farmer these bill be only in favour of trader and corporates if a farmer violate the contract then the trader get stay on his farm and due to the appiontment of big law firm the farmer will not get justice and hoard the whole economy of india be around fifty corporates and these be who control modi govt and another big issue of wto and imf they have big oppuritunity in indian market and resource of which they use it at very cheap rate and make money our poor indian people be once again on the path of slaveness due to bad policy of illeterated and tea seller jumbebaj pm shri narender modi ji please think deep you will get all real picture of it jai kisan jai bjarat

what a hypocrisy and liar tell only small segment of farmer fail to understand their enlighten law for farmer betterment what a sick man still glorify himself and his sick policy never again
the main problem in all of this be the shrewd mind of each and everyone of u or atleast most of u people find out loophole or other way to exploit even in old bill and will find way to exploit even in new bill like for example the case of starbucks they offer good value in contract farm so it a win win for both corporate and farmer since the farmer then give them good quality produce in india they will do contract farming and since there be no msp regulation in new bill the person buying will exploit the farmer in one way or other there be already many loop hole in the bill and i think it be impossible to perfectly draft a universally correct bill all this because when each one of u be selfish and want maximum for self corruption and exploitation will happen it be a sad truth and i think this will not bring any change infact in the long run the corporates will exploit farmer
if not please let mr purie know it be still not too late

congress rule the country for more than 65 year and they do nothing to upgrade archaic law it have take 55 year for the country to come up with new law for farm sector when the relevance of a political party becomes low resistance to any change be obvious now it be the role of state government to ensure msp for small grower a pm have repeatedly make clear that exist msp be untouched and in fact there be delta increase since majority of state be under bjp those state should take a leaf out the book and protect small marginal farmer in fact economist have laud government initiative if the congress desire to consolidate itself a a political force it should work with government a a constructive opposition but should stop oppose every law for the sake of be in opposition

in present senerio when 76 percent of farmer want to leave farming and major of indian farmer be near poverty line and non of the previous govt system be able to uplift them then we should give this bill a chance for at least some year may be this bill have some loophole but there could be many thing in positive so yes we should not make it political and should think of farmer only
the new farm law will not only affect the farmer but also u the citizen who rely on the farm product directly or indirectly change to uplift the agriculture and farmer lifestyle be definitely require but it must also involve understand their issue at the ground level and work on the solution around it a small inconvenience in our life to uplift our farmer live be the least we could take

liberal would never support communism or any other authoritarian regime so not sure what you have put those two together a a liberal i have to agree that the goal the government be pursue be good the reform will harm allot of people who rely on farm the underlying idea be that small scale farming be unsustainable a they will not be able to compete with big farm corporation the government want be to quickly reform the farming sector with disregard to what will happen to farmer in my opinion the government should create a government farm fund that would issue out loan and grant to farmer for land acquisition and modernization and give out additional subsidy to those farmer that would want to sell their land and offer them financial incentive to change profession the government should also prevent land monopolization by judge corporation that want to enter or increase their hold on the farming market if the reform be do right farm will become large and more modernized and thus will be able to produce more produce that could be sell at cheap price the farmer will earn more the food will be cheap the government should not leave behind those that decide or in a bad case scenario will be force by the market to sell their land these people can start business that provide service for farmer poland go threw similar reform and have do fairly well with it be farm market the government in poland have oversight over the farming industry a provide financial incentive low tax grant and low interest loan to farmer

it appear vox be a left leaning medium agency and not a very good source of neutral information some point make here be good but should be take overall with a pinch of salt
government should try tax the farmer who go above msp and add extra tax to the corporates and wholesaler if they go below msp
indian farmer help indian economy throughout and be still help during these time when indian economy be in shamble
it be interest how government intervention create the problem yet indian farmer rather operate under a centralized governance rather than a free market society although many job would be potentially lose in the process it would also benefit the economy a a whole history have show that competition can lead to increase in efficiency and can help to solve problem that could not have be counter without such competition even if farmer be entirely replace which would be an indication of consumer favouritism job opportunity would still be create and might favour those with an education or who wish to increase the quality of their life this be a process which have occur historically in many country that evolve from farm to industrialization it be almost a necessary sacrifice if society wish to evolve and thus should not always be resist
just a basic question prior to this bill
government need to rectify these law there a many flaw in these law
have u make any case study on adani group enter the apple market in himachal their buying price to farmer be steadily fall whereas sell price of apple steadily increase
listen to a vox video on the subject and wasnt impress i felt they didnt explain the motivation behind these law or why change be necessary this video clear that up really good job james from new zealand

bjp chunav jivi hai
i expect the same from you vox you be a left leaning organization the big mistake you do be in order to support people who share your ideology you deliberately get unhinge from reality and logic hate for those who do not share your ideology have make you myopic i still believe that one day you will get back to do what once you aspire
and mandis be already dead in most part of india people will sell to high price outside market albeit illegally and some state notice and give up on mandi and deregulate it now this law will give big foreign company or conglomerate who can invest in the storage facility transportation and also help in contract out the farmer at good price and offer help in modernization of agriculture
nowhere in the first act it be mention that apmc will be dissolve so how exactly be we come to a conclusion that the producer would have to resort only to private corporation and would not a dual mechanism provide more space for farmer
what kind of modern farmer they be
already 60 farmer die
truly they be not hindu muslim sikh they be farmer the last time british united indian the same way

a big salute to the hero who stand up for their right and refuse to back down
big but poor this mentality of protest farmer show the wisdom of mass protest in india
before you make a myopic conclusion lem me clear some of your basic there be two way in a house by which a motion or a bill can be pass voice vote and division by rule any motion or bill be first pass by a voice vote just a they do here if ayes be loud theyre say to have it if the no be loud theyre say to have it seem undemocratic right here where division come into play even if a single member of the house be unsatisfied or oppose to the decision make by the voice vote by rule the vote be take again by a digital vote recorder machine if youd have see the proceeding of r on 20th september youd have notice that no member of the opposition be oppose unsatisfied with the voice vote which by default make it the final decision even if a single member wouldve be against the voice vote the division process would have be initiate so u just cant blame bjp for it conduct the voice vote thats how parliament have be work since year
can you make similar video for labor law amendment

i personally have just one issue with this analysis which be to treat the word farmer a a homogeneous group i believe all analysis on farmer issue will become much more nuanced once we start categorise different type of farmer base on their landholding mechanisation labour employ etc the status quo definitely benefit some stakeholder otherwise it would not have exist and any reform will hurt this category at the end of the day if the reform hurt the rich category of farmer marginally in the short run while increase the option for the most marginal category of farmer then it come down to who do you support in this scenario
truly unbiased detailed analysis thanks bro appreciate your preciseness

good video but lack few thing one farm income be diminish because too many people depend on it even it not profitable question should be what be solution to increase income either reduce too much dependency or increase option in source of income only flaw in argument present by video any regulation or body regulation will always lead to cartel formation this idea of msp be against the very idea of free market economy who will decide msp how will be handle for future price it always supply and demand all those who will decide msp will form a cartel again free market can not work like that agree law should be against corporate monopoly but in agri supply chain sector cant be monopolize like aircraft entry barrier be low a for ola uber i guess technology will always disrupt them after certain point they arnt boeing or airbus that take high entry cost to disrupt msp be not the way it will always cartel the very great idea it want to achieve a product which deserve to have msp mean it doesnt have the right demand in the marker free market economy cant be work like that idea or framework should be for litigation and judicial process in case of such rampant exploitation and price control by corporate solution should that this farm supply chain sector should be multi player market rather than few large player in mix govt can fork policy to restrict monopolization by big firm if more player be in mix farmer will have the best buyer msp be retrogressive way for free economy msp be not the solution

i stand with the farmer it be high time that we a citizen stand up against this fascist regime and question this government for fill the pocket of the so called industrialist
if msp be fix how would grade of product will work you can not sell grade a d produce at same msp
what about the decision that pvt sector will take for grow crop like instead of natural one they will focus on genetically modify crop would not that affect the environment and our health
i be not a bjp supporter in any way but i think this law be a step in the right direction msp applies to only 20 odd crop many farmer stick in a loop of produce the same crop and thus many time govt will end up have too much produce in hand and there be some wto restriction that stop govt from export all of it we be end up with large food wastage let be not jump the gun and declare the new bill be evil
but the govt clarify that msp will not be affect so irrespective of the farmer cultivation cost he be still eligible for msp even outside the state
you should join any dalaal news channel if the government want the welfare of the farmer why be the msp remove

i really like your explanation of the farm bill and the execution that will happen a a consequence but i do not agree with your solution to prevent exploitation instead of control the market like in the soviet or ashokan model government should enable more competition and support creative destruction of the exist company or within the company step can be promotion of start ups in this sector enable infra require to grow ease of finance etc

he be the bad pm in history of indian politics why do he bring the law and why do he repeal it i will not vote this party ever
we need to support the farmer of our country we should also raise our voice against these ordinance to protect them from exploitation if not now then when their demand will get fulfill they be still suffer in our country because of some bad policy of our government
earlier law never benefit other state so not give clearance to these new law will result in much great farmer protest

msp be never a law so the farmer can be fuck over whenever the govt want indian govt be procure too much of some crop sit and rot in gowdown it happen to come in use cause of covid so india offer the msp for certain crop be skew incentive and these northern state be cultivate crop not suit to that land rice take too much water at scale
after farm bill be withdraw
and one more point the commodity share market will not give the msp minimum support price a market behave on demand supply and future prediction it may give the indicative fair price but that can be low than the farmer own expense and hard work
common people should go against the govt since all democratic way not work with this govt brutal of haryana govt who block the gateway to delhi

msp will be there and mandis will be there too but farmer can sell their farm product outside which be actually depend on farmer goi cant force them
and government do tatty in godi news
i think the central govt be hesitate to legalise msp be because it then become a inflationary factor with diff farmer group lobby for high and high msp
only 36 of agriculture produce be sell through mandis and that too mainly in punjab and haryana so we need to actually replicate that system and expand the mandi system elsewhere while leave the farmer at mercy of private player with no safeguard be not the solution
the old regime of law run in parallel with new one it be like have the best of both world
if you know the reality of how these mandis work you would not say that do not this concern you that the big coporates be now be give a licence to start hoard farm produce
we stand with farmer

small farmer cooperative society in every district seem the best solution with a few educate honest and market savy leadership they will have good bargain power by reduce have to deal with middle men price for consumer too will reduce
sir you should have say sorry before hundred of farmer die

salute to you mr rathee you always use to explain an important point in a simple way
both extreme solution will be damage to people the current system be unsustainable a small farmer produce very little and thus can not compete on an open market without government subsidy even with the subsidy the farmer earn very little which do not allow them to invest in modernization the liberalization of the farming industry will force many farmer out of business a big player will outperform and outcompete small farmer that will be force to sell their land and figure out by themselves what they should do now the latter solution wa not to quickly change the faming market no matter the human cost margaret tatcher style this will have quick beneficial result for the country but many farmer will be leave to fend for themselves furthermore there be a risk that uncontrolled land acquisition full by corruption will create a handful of huge corporation that control and dominate the market destroy even large independent farmer

be punjab the only state which do farm apparently i think more than half of india population be do farm i dont see protest happen anywhere else
do you think the government be so dumb to anger the farmer

the best video i saw of yours be about how to make youtube video i think you should make video on bollywood where you may say anything without run the risk of be wrong agriculture be a different business and it would help if you live in a village for a year to know the truth a farmer can not sell his crop at a preferred high rate place 10 km away because it be across the border into another state and he have to go 50 km in the wrong direction within his state to sell at a low price there be many such lacuna in the present system that even your private agriculture expert do not know a he sound more urban all protest be politically motivated and would die down naturally after punjab election so hold breath and let farmer benefit do not thank bjp if you do not want to but do not spread lie either
first talk about how these law be pass amidst a pandemic without any approval from member of parliment

2 the third bill intention be to bring a third party organization into farming and protect farmer from famine and other natural disaster while also increase the diversity of agricultural product which be currently very limited due to a lack of certainty in post harvesting income look at how much wheat production be increase in up mp and punjab and how mp recently cross 300 mt of wheat production in the year 20 21 which get waste due to very poor storage facility so the clarity would come from a proper dialogue with farmer and curb the weak area of law to make them legible and clearer which i think goi try up to some extent but we all saw what exactly happen if the implementation of these bill have be effective with proper clarity then it would have make farmer more confident and secure so they could have start think toward other farming option and process and may eventually shift towards organic farming as well
correction plz attention nobody apply tax on anyone in transaction happen via apmc seller i e farmer get full payment without deduction of either tax or commission farmer only have to settle thier due if only they have borrow any amount for thier personal expense apmc trader get their income in form of commission pay to then by buyer like fci and instead these trader pay tax to apmc for development of apmc infrastructure and part of it be share with state govt of haryana and punjab for build road link rural area to mainstream i differ with your knowledge

well a good explanation but put a mandatory msp be not a solution for example if people reduce their cereal intake in next 5 year but the msp remain same the buyer would be obligate to buy a commodity that be no longer in demand this also kill innovation at farmer be end and disincentives them to move on to a crop in demand take punjab for example all and all instead of put msp govt must setup strengthen a strong anti competitive body to watch over market manipulation and this it can protect farmer from unfair price

new farm bill be more vulnerable to monopoly atleast when you know that there be no limit on hoard when there should be also like you say that the product be perishable in nature hoard only help them exploit the producer farmer even more for eg a product with msp of r 100 for once be purchase at r 120 result in maximum produce and sale let be say twice the actual demand the remain produce can be hoard and in the next season trader buyer can either refuse to buy new product or ask them farmer to sell the same product at a half price because of their perishable nature farmer would not have other option but to agree also the potential player will be very limited and an open market say be just a gimmick because in the begin the product will be purchase at lucrative price which have never be offer earlier at price which can not be pay by others even with take huge loss on the account of buyer to kill a potential competition like it happen in the case of jio even idea and vodafone fail to survive which other buyer can take loss as much a adani in the agriculture sector anyone and then when the competition be dead there be no msp to protect farmer be interest mandis will close down eventually a they d largely remain non functional because of a good deal from the pvt buyer in the beginning like it happen with bsnl we already have see such market disaster in the recent time do not we learn anything from it how can farmer survive an exploitative monopoly which even idea and vodafone could not survive apmcs be atleast in the interest of farmer new farm bill actually make the producer farmer most vulnerable in apmcs trader license be give to those who be close to state govts and the govts keep change thus keep the cycle run open market with no law for msp unlimited hoarding and with giant like adani it be just delusional to expect a fair business take place even in an open market this monopoly be worse by a 100 mile when compare to the conventional system of apmcs
we need news reporter like samdish and camera man like parth
you have say that congress should not have problem and why protest so you mean congress arrange protest
the analysis be one side the new bill only provide for additional opportunity for the farmer this in no way remove obliterate apmcs apmcs till today have no competition because the farmer be force to sell there and the trader in the apmcs could cartelise against farmer when the consumer purchase from any shop that he wish why not make available the same benefit to farmer the decision be for farmer to take on where to sell the apmcs may sense competition offer them a good rate and hence may have a chance to improve their relevance currently farmer get about 30 of the value pay by the consumer if the same be at 50 the farmer income would go up more than 100 consider input and other cost the apmc act modification and removal of restriction have be earlier push by the congress government also in fact most of the state have adopt major apmc reform in fact state like kerala have no apmc and there the farmer get relatively good return for their produce a compare to other state about 50 of the value pay by the consumer also the congress manifesto of 2019 specifically mention removal of apmc restriction this current drama be only poltically motivate good return for farmer without disturb the price pay by the consumer can only happen by bring about efficiency and transparency in the market mechanism in any case this be only an additional opportunity for farmer which be upto the farmer to take a decision on whether to make use of or not
tnx bbc hindi

2 as far a i have read the farmer bill it be write that the price for what their produce will be already decide before provide the suplly of seed fertilizer will also be discuss before hand and a deal in form of bond will be make so i think this be benificial but here be there and minimum support price
all you say be right i believe but we need to look at a fact that msp can not be guarantee if guarantee forcefully and suppose a crop do not meet standard of a company then no one will buy the crop result in total loss to the farmer who have produce that low quality crop and crop quality be not always in hand of a farmer
excellent analysis by dhruv you could have add one more point about how big corporates can backward integrate into farming and take the livelihood of farmer but great video i have no doubt that corporates do not have any interest of farmer at heart and would sell produce at usurious rate to consumer repeal these contentious farm law be the only option at this stage
farmer be important in life
any farmer can sell his produce anywhere in the country this thing be already there lot of false info

this be a democracy and a welfare state govt should consider the farmer be demand no big farmer will sacrifice their life for agitation the big industry be also take subsidise electricity water land tax exemption etc why they be give incentive people have see the green revolution happen in the past which be support by farmer
so farmer be protest be not that much sensible they should first have to see what government have to do with that bill
you say you be neutral but a neutral person tell both bright side and dark side
hence contract farm unless there be a control on the product grown be also dangerous
salute and love from pakistan farmer no matter from which country should never be suppress and discriminate against i myself be an aarti from pk and i truly understand the problem

thank you for a very well explain video although not everything be wrong in the farm bill but i see the loophole but that be prevalent in any kind of process cant government and farmer come to the middle way where farmer interest be also be maintain and the bill can also be pass
2 by this new farm bill pd system will be affect
it be sad because haryana government have decide that they want 75 reservation for local people and they be go to pass that bill it be like say that newyork corporation need to hire 75 people only from newyork not from other part of united state so modi have to withdraw farm bill it be not the first time state government in india always try to implement this rule they do not want people from other state flock into their state mainly target at up bihar which be most populous state in india so alot have be go on in background and it be not a win it be a total loss of india if you look in term of country be prospective
it should have be mention that food company retailer can buy non perishable item in large quantity at the time of harvest give no sensible price benefit to farmer and store that to sell within mandated 100 increase without attract essential commodity act even if that provision be impose prospectively it will not make any dent on company be profit so it will squarely benefit the procurer only anyone who keep track of increase in onion price every year know that this be a play by large trader only farmer do not get any benefit of high price hereafter it will be legitimate action for all commodity
fake news watch be legend
ca not the farmer form cooperative and control their entire supply chain produce process to sell export if the government deregulate fails to protect the people come together into cooperative that develop and market product present a great longterm advantage and gain
thank you so much for this video sir we d really appreciate more such video on current issue please keep them come yours be way more informative than the other channel

even before these bill come into effect i have see price of onion go up more than 100 and then come back to normal twice in a single year in my state i be from west bengal nobody regulate the price but now at least it would be in a limited price bracket it far far good than current scenario

3rd at that time when there be need of green revolution msp be require bcz production at that time be very low and we need to increase more and more land under cultivation but now we need quality and productivity along with diversification of crop in line with domestic and international market so that we produce what be need not what we want for personal reason
good channel for business analysis but for policy analysis more homework may be necessary especially where it hurt and where it help and which segment of the society
i be from bihar in bihar average income from an acre in bihar be 25k to 30k but in punjab hariyana farmer earn average 1 lakh r from an acre this be just because of corrupt politician i be with farmer if farmer be not happy with the ordinance than remove this ordinance
modi govt should give income tax exemption also to physically handicap and punjab govt should give free electricity to handicap punjabis too we do not support the demand by physically handicap for a separate wikilangista
more than half of protester be worker of opposition party almost all belongs to punjab state which be be govern by congress party
contract farming be happen even today infact it all start from punjab first just that there be very little regulation and lack of it create more dispute
great way of explanation but i have one doubt if msp legalise than consider if more farmer grow wheat and in market the surplus of wheat and consumer still have to buy it at high price govt ca not fix price price fix by market it self definitely govt need to control cartel and corporate interference
joint committe of farmer and govt will finalize the law clauses that will benefit farmer or not but union be adament

arm force hi kareingi inka solution vrna ye to yaar national highway aise hi band rakhenge
if the big daddy want the farmer to produce genetically modify product neither the consumer nor the farmer have any choice and the same go for farm input like fertiliser pesticide etc
this protest be not limit to farmer agitation but on a large scale it be a reflection of society be raise concern against privatisation capitalism this be a new beginning against the tyranny of capitalism or big corporates stronghold in the government policy
there be future contract that company take all the time on commodity why so much complex explanation if farming get formalize then nobody need to do direct contract
i think it be bad now explanation make to support the bill
in punjab 80 farmer get benefit from msp which be more then any other state

inspite of the covid danger for themselves if farmer be protest why be it so hard for the govt and police to understand the seriousness of the issue
and when farmer be expose to the market will not they have more say in the cost and since agricultural be a primary sector function they will affect market than the market trend affect them right
just to come back after punjab election
1 59 haha bro no mahindra thar or any indian jeep come with airbags
in the second bill when the demand be low the private player will buy at low price from farmer so if the farmer return to the mandi the demand be still low at market and he will still not be able to sell at msp so he have to get to party worker and broker to sell his product and still same result atleast he can approach multiple private player outside
this be the affect of american capitalism upon society adopt such technique will only lead to disaster a can be see in the current state of the west
still i appreciate pm that this protest need to control a we have more external issue with communist china and pakistan

your argument seem to be one side you say there be nothing wrong in these rule on the other hand you yourself say 3 13 13 that in some country farmer get 32 34 out of the 40 market rate but you never explain how this will be achieve in our case when the private player have no necessity to pay even the msp to farmer and why this cant be achieve without privatization

many people be also politically motivate a they see this a their chance to gain some point against the current gov those who be participate in make a mess and destroy barrier be not part of the protest even the farmer have say so
and thus a system have build over time which profit few like middleman and rich farmer who be farmer a they own huge land but in reality they employ thousand of small laborer in their field every harvesting season but not who own small land and few cattle those who own agricultural land do not have to pay tax thus buy agricultural land and employ labor at a lowest wage be a system in place which have keep many people stick in deep poverty
this be just the begin expect more dharnas and anarchy in coming time spineless govt
you want to raise farm income dont complain about inflation when food price go up it actually help farmer you can spend 1000 at a pizza hut but complain if food price go up by a few rupee hypocrite

bjp sponsor video throughout the video she keep talk about how apmc be be misuse but do not tell how the new bill would fix these issue also all the point she make be from the govt perspective at no point do she talk about why the farmer be protest against the bill towards the end she talk about shanta kumar who head the committe who himself be a bjp leader and former hp cm the committee never mention of only 6 farmer get msp in the report they submit infact the 6 figure come from a remark of shanta kumar in a recent interview where he allege that the farmer protest be the 6 of elite farmer he then go on to say that only 6 farmer get msp so it be just a remark not factual data
govt be not do away with apmc and msp

this farmer in the protest be only from state like haryana and punjab where be the farmer from other state do u see any one up to 45 of crop benefit be only get by haryana and punjab farmer others farmer form different state do not get that amount of many or benefit from old farm law due to this 1000 of farmer from different state dy every day state like haryana and punjab farmer get high income in old farm law but in other state due to less income farmer can not buy any machine use in crop for low income farmer this new farmer bill be announce to give them high income and good future but in state like haryana and punjab they get great price by sell to the government which be due to the old farm law also in the state of punjab government get up to 5 of government tax only form the farmer of punjab but this new farm law be great for poor farmer not for the state farmer like haryana and punjab

farmer will never find a solution for their problem
be hm lakhimpur se he hai
before implement farm law government should make sure that everyone be educate for understand anything
if there be a flaw in newly introduce system what be the benefit of old the system do our farmer become the rich farmer of the world everyone know that only middleman become rich through apmc even though there be msp and many time even msp at so low where farmer have to bear the loss our farmer become more poorer with the old system so if early government try with apmc which be also a failure why can not this current government try something new we know this current government try thing which be never do before and unfortunately some of them do not work a per the expectation of this so called librandoos but this be the life and how human be evolve
mam you be talk about msp and msp again and again read the bill their be no even one clause in farm bill about msp

agriculture bill be demonetization part 2
all these people comment do any body have data of the market price temporal
there be no restriction in that
1 43 thats exactly the reason why modi keep win again and again and again
to any where in india to any one no restriction it be upto local government to
supreme court lose his belief as well a modi government
this video be very informative and we will put together
punjab farmer be rich and big so they do not need to worry but imagine of small farmer who be go to die of hunger again
context the new law be give freedom to farmer to sell their produce anywhere in country without interference government procurement system which be a long pending reform some people or i can say middle man have some vested interest so they be manipulate uneducated farmer by tell them that they will not get fair price of there crop and guess what those people be also leader of farmer and than there be whole religious and communist angle
this again be what a true grassroots movement of the people by the people for the people look like these farmer be true hero
4 why be protest happen only from punjab what be the link between mandis of punjab and the politician from punjab dare you to cover the flow of money between mandis and the politician

a mostly correct bill with the aim of do something good in government be pov pass without notice loophole it have both positves and negatives government be good in their pov and farmer be protest to make this bill perfect with some outside interruption that make indian go against indian
who care be it the big issue at present a country do not run only through food there be a lot more and farm become privatize or corporatized be nothing wrong you may swear modi trump biden and many more but they know more than you do you or me know how to run our life and issue or protest but the modi trump biden xi jingping boris know to run country practically not on the basis of sentiment and emotion
if understand correctly what farmer be ask for be a msp for their product so even if you can actually get rice at a low cost government should buy it at an inflated price i totally agree with this demand my only condition be that since everyone who pass graduation do not get same salary government should provide same basic salary for all graduate i think that would be fair
just a strategic move right before election in up and punjab it could have be announce on any day any mann ki baat show but the choice of day be a religious day everyone in medium first give tag to our sikh brother like terrorist and raise question if they be really kisan or not see their appearance comment like kisan hoke pizza khaye ja rahe hen
shoot about you will not have enough time so i understand if you have not read the law even a little bit wait a minute but when you talk about a lot of a remote country that you do not know be not that call gossiping

modi govt try to ramrod their way with farm bill no discussion no consultation with stakeholder who would be impact by these bill no debate in parliament before the introduction of the bill even if these bill be good these be not pass via due process or be rather force on them
2 the new law do not give any statutory backing to msp in fact there be not even a mention of either msp or procurement in the say bill so without a legal status the msp and govt subsidy could be reduce or stop at any time by govt
these new law be not for 1 or 2 state right every one should think about whole india a a nation
now bhakts will say this be also a masterstroke
so law no 1 be the main reason and it should have make optional accord to the state n their need whether they need contract farm or not yes it sound a bit dangerous
i know farmer be concern but instead of demand to repeal the whole act but specific amendment should be carry out which be deny by farm leader therefore farm leader need to be more sensitive to this issue
fan of punjabi culture like here
few thousand protest against the government have catch worldwide attention beg a big question of intention behind the protest and those who be try to highlight it

the life of a farmer in india have always be miserable from independence same dependence on rainfall lack of modern input etc hundred of farmer suicide each year due to indebtness i say the law will benefit indian farmer we have protect our market for decade lead to lack of competition dynamism
msp be a racket to enrich farmer esp large one in punjab haryana and western uttar pradesh because 60 of msp go to support grain like rice and wheat the main product of the those 3 state that be why they be the only one protest most of the poor farmer of bihar and other region of india who really need help do not even know what msp be because they have not be able to take advantage of it there be structural reason for it and that be why you do not see them protest against the bill reform in indian ag sector be need because the policy have fail to elevate ag sector in a long time have say that i be surprise that modi shah fail to read politics of subsidy esp in agriculture may be they have become too over confident have successfully ram through article 370 and caa legislation

i think these 3 bill be not good for farmer government just want to leave their duty to support poor farmer and these bill be mostly support private company indian farmer be not as strong a private company and they can not fight for their right from these company it be govt duty to help and facilitate poor farmer and in india mostly farmer be small farmer

thank you dhruv you really do a great work i would never find such a good fair analysis of the situation and news

man you really be a bad actor and annoying as hell when you try to overact regardless thanks for the info but i have a question i have hear that the farmer be free to sell their produce earlier too so how have this abolishment of apmcs help with anything be it really a necessity for someone to sell their product to government earlier it sound a bit alien to me

both punjab and haryana get the high subsidy in the country with almost 50 off on input include electricity and fertilizer but still the crop produce be sell expensive compare to international price of the same comodity where be competitiveness
to give an update on this protest the government unconditionally repeal all the three new law the farmer have declare victory
proud of the farmer of this country the farmer of this country have sacrifice their and their family welfare for the middleman of punjab and haryana because 80 percent of msp money have be bag by farmer of these two state only and other state farmer be anyway at the mercy of unorganised sector buyer now these other state farmer can not get access to corporate money and technology to uplift i bow down to their selfless sacrifice
farmer want to more prosperous but be afraid of free market volatility if they get less money they protest and if they be ask to get into free market they still protest coz they will lose their subsidy and assurance by government they want to get high price from private company but want government to bear the heat if it do not work out in their favor

for starter agriculture go down a of gdp do not mean money go out of agriculture a gdp be not fix then farmer income depend on multiple thing besides mandis like avg land holding govt purchase avg subsidy etc so punjab have high income mean a little when their agriculture have be grow slow than rest of india for decade not to forget that grain arrival during a short period affect by lockdown be hardly a solid data for analyse trend
this be the same problem farmer face in australia in the end corporation with big money will buy out the prime land and only subsistence farm will remain in the hand of ordinary farmer remember that the modi government have come to power and stay in power by marginalise minority this may be the end of that type of representation

what be the point of government fci buy the produce at msp when the nation be have surplus wheat and rice a government cant resell these to any international market since the msp outside be well below our msp so it stay there in the warehouse and get rotten so whose be at loss government of course
the buyer whether private or fci have to deposit the tax to state govt mandi be for maintenance of link road network for mandi be construction of new mandi be
the method by which this bill be pass in rajya sabha be by no mean unconstitutional yes you may say that it be unethical furthermore as far a my understanding go about the three bill this reform have more merit than demerit which could have be improve by a few amendment therefore i can conclude although big farmer get an advantage out of it small farmer have fall into a big loss

except punjab haryana and western up nothing protest in india against farm law
look like corruption in agriculture in india be deep rooted grab farm from the small farmer by the big farmer their exploitation and the profit sharing by the face behind them
there be lot of difference between what people be talk and the ground reality apmc act have be eliminate in 2006 and the condition of farmer in bihar be very painful
corporate legal team under farm bill there be one option of model contract agreement which govt may issue for farmer so that no one can manipulate farmer with their complex clause in their contract and govt now consider this seriously
since india be a member of wto low cost food material palmoil rubber all these type of item will come to india from different nation at a low price so the corporates have a choice one more thing i want to tell you be that during covid time also more foriegn car be sell out rather than indian make car people love to travel in mini cooper or ford rather than indian make nano or maruthi car so how the govt can compell the people

at least bjp govt now have get a chance
best of luck all farmer around the world from
i have be in punjab for 3 year the actual farmer still get hardly two or three rupee for tomato or potato but a per mandy system they be force to sell their crop certain licence broker in maharashtra onion be sell to sarathpawar and his daughter in this way
itna jhooth bolne wali government kabhi nhi aayi desh me
the research and all be highly appreciated and great but it be sadden to see that the word middleman be not even mention farmer have be get low price while consumer be pay relatively extremely high price for the same crop so it be obvious who be take away all the cream this issue be even raise by opposition govt leader but somehow they be quiet now moreover the way the law be work there be still an option and people can go along the traditional path and if that be what farmer want the traditional chain would be follow without be affect by the unregulated space it be not like mandis be be scrap off the main issue in hand be huge miscommunication between the central govt and the farmer i think both side be not still ready to listen to each other completely and other people be try to advantage of this our duty at the moment must be to allow free flow of knowledge on both side to reach an absolute consensus instead of just be one side to look revolutionary
ab desh ko ek hokr in kisano k name pr gundda grdi krne walo k khilaf action lena hoga nito ye desh brbad krne wale h yhi inka main aim h plz support your government and honest your country
modi government ko action lena chahiye joo bharat ke against jaye
what a shameless anchor
bro there be 4 5 farmer come with their produce daily at a retailer near me they wait for the retailer to give them a good price and at the end of the day go back with all of their produce go back to some other retailer the other day let not talk about mcdonalds which be a foreign brand let talk about our indian farmer
it be ok that government can not help u with good facility but atleast do not take our basic farm right
a the apmc still valid declare the entire state a apmc mean no outside left after apmc this mean support price applies to all farmer
this time they govt bring new bill pretty easily coz there be no big player in it but just think when ambanis and adanis be in business and it there monopoly then theres gon na be no chance for reform we know with power n money you can do whatever you wish in this country
rather than this kind of law government should help farmer to start a consortium in each village and help them to start to sell their product directly to customer by provide building or infrastructure we do not want to buy high price or frozen item from mall
small farmer can form their own private government cooperative organization with respect to which crop they be produce then the free market idea can be legible accord to me because if all the farmer produce apple get unite a one unit it will be tough for company to con them
no food no farmer
big loss to farmer but also end of all hope for opposition to win
modi be a visionary leader anti india be will oppose him we love modi
thank you sir for support farmer in this tough time
farmer ki problem simple hai wo educate nahi hai unke pas modern agriculture practice nhi pata sarkar apmc mandi ko well krna chahiye aur cost and price ek profitable margin dena chahiye

great decision thanks to the farmer protest for their right a country where farmer flourish will achieve win over poverty and hunger
this be not democracy it be no where near democracy the pm have a lot to answer for
thanks for explain the bill very concise and clear explanation
i could not understand what be say about the farmer move out of the exist mandis and into the outside market why be it bound to happen if the farmer be get a good price or if it a good system for them which they believe evident from their demand in the protest why would they want to move out also the outside market can also not be exploit to the extent it be assume in the video that be what farmer union be for it have be assume in the entire video that the price will drop and the farmer will be exploit at these low price however sufficient guarantee have be give by the govt along with safeguard against such price drop these bill be be demand by farm union for over a decade and now that they have get it they want it to be take back
bjp will not win in up
lastly on buy produce from farmer and not online from company in my experience whenever i have purchase thing directly from farmer there have be no price difference then whats the point secondly large company also give employment to huge number of people how would you counter that
just saw republic tv reporter try to change the narrative by shout the police be plead join hand to the farmer
2 why do the farmer deviate from their route which be decide earlier
small farmer should protest in favour of farm law because this law be in favour of them
congrats to leave wing eco system by tell modi fascist hitler repeatedly for what he be not you guy be bring him to the level of jethalal
modi work for reliance and ambani and our farmer work to fee people be and nobody can not defeat them
3 farmer force to grow crop accord to global demand with import gm seed and fertilizer while stop indigenous crop and food variety and hence consume more water damage soil water and envoirnment
i m from india the protest be only limited to one state caste which be punjab that be why it have already flop indian people around india do not care about them
yogi law system be easy for anti national
janab punjab me election he isliye
punjabi farmer should protest against the government world government nowadays be get so corrupt and make stupid decision
punjab farmer have do a wonderful job in the initial year of the green revolution but gradually massive subsidy no income tax and msp free electricity wrong entry of khud kasht actual tiller status in revenue record by corrupt patwaris etc turn these once hard work farmer into super middleman and broker for small farmer artiyas a sort capitalist absentee land lordship exploitative form of function new farm law give small farmer an opportunity to become independent
they want to capitalize everything we will have a series of reliance sabzi mandi market q ke iske baad to sara produce ambani hi khareedega
many anti farmer will celebrate
bjps farmer bill be rubbish this bill give many unfair advantage to corporates
congratulation trevor noah you be on the next tweet of the world most beautiful most talented actress kongana ranaut
i love this reporting this andolan be a world historic and give hope that we can uproot any dictator if arise in india
kitna fraud news channel hai yaar these be the same people who be brand farmer a terrorist
dont agree with last point that price will increase due to competition the price would be in check also hoard be necessary so that food storage infrastructure can be create by corporate money it a very good reform corporates have make a lot of contribution towards economy and infrastructure like road highway telecom corporates be job and wealth creator not enemy
but this will do not cater the problem of exploitation by buyer which will not buy produce at msp or above msp because new bill do not provide legal backing to msp hence farmer be protest
thank god there will be no suiside case of farmer in the future
now they r our farmer this be g8
you have do a brilliant job yes job that electronic medium and print medium should be do your style be classic showing and convey very serious issue in such an interesting manner hope we will continue to more of such effort throughout the protest congratulation and best wish
love you everyone from punjab up hariyana rajisthan southindian
kick out achedin terrorist govt jai kisan
it all about give advantage to big pvt player and you know them shame mudi govt they do not leave our farmer
farmer dont need any so call reform
this be what exactly be happen around the country nobody have dare to come out of their own comfort zone
in second example only very few farmer store their produce only the big one and they too do not do it regularly a they be not that big to affect the market it be only the buyer company who do this
sale of propaganda
yes right tikait black miller he be take up from i congress se fund with an others many gang se
why nobody ask what be wrong with the law just becoz farmer be protest do not make them right most of our youth be just influence by social medium instead of read the law themselves
we be become internally and externally vulnerable indian youth be too nive to international politics
nice but one confusion by remove certain item from essential commodity how the income of farmer be go to increase big player can easily fluctuate the price by hoard and release massively accord to their need like when they need to buy from farmer they release the stock in market in huge quantity and tell the farmer that look the price be down and the farmer will sell their product at low price and after that they again start hoard and reduce the supply in market thus raise price so how the farmer get benefit out of this
main thing be right to get msp for rice and wheat and pusles at least 10 15 r per kg and pd shd b raise to 10 kg per person per month or 40kgs per family to all ie 3 36lk cr must b keep aside ir 140cr x10kgs x12mths 20rs ie 3 36lk cr must b kept by a food security of the nation another 10kgs must b provide a protein subsidy to each person ie another 3 36lk cr with immediate effect and farmer allow to sell thr product against to shop from wr off take can happen in each village and city with govt intervention for distribution and storage provide 400rs per person shd b make a fundamental right to life per month when these bstrds get 80 5lakdh a payment for do shit
anonymous official we be in a state where slavery have be accept wholesale and there be people who believe that the ruling class have the legitimate moral right to rule and other people be legitimately their slave this be really where we be at in humanity worldwide and the vast majority of people have accept that paradigm and what it be it be a cult religious belief system that be completely false completely erroneous there be not enough people speak out encourage that that be a false paradigm and belief system this be what the message that we have to put out there to this body of the population that still believe the mainstream medium narrative and still believe the government narrative to believe in authority be to condone slavery that be exactly what it be stop sugarcoat it and start say what it be to other people to believe in authority be to condone slavery if you be a believer in authority and you be a believer that there be moral legitimacy to government you be someone who be say i believe in and condone slavery because that be what the right to command and rule other people be it be slavery and that be what government be on it face and i will not sugarcoat that that be what it be i m here to put that out there a the plain and simple truth and encourage others to do the same there be no such thing a the right to rule or command others we have to stop believing that there be because to even believe it be to condone slavery and it be completely immoral and it be completely base on violence so now what be happen be that the narrative of this master class be be say never to be question it be not to be question by member of the slave class this be what all this social shaming be all about by the member of the cult see the cult member want to point finger at other people who do not believe their worldview of authority their authoritative authoritarian worldview you know they want to say oh shame on you no not shame on u shame on you for accept that slavery be morally legitimate how about that that be how the table have to be turn your worldview be false and illegitimate morally on it face and now big tech company big tech corporation be try to make it impossible to get the word out by censor social medium and censor people and deplatforming them and all that be gon na do be insight very very dark day ahead let be just say it be already turn in that direction because of how people have be oppress and people do not understand what it be a powder keg it be not just a powder keg here in america folk it be a powder keg worldwide and you better psychologically prepare yourself and i m tell everybody out there too because most people who say they be for the truth and for freedom do not do their work they fail at their job to morally educate the public there be not enough of the voice of truth the reality be speak into existence lady and gentleman the universe have speak into existence what we experience in our daily reality in the aggregate in the collective be base upon what people say what people accept into them the information they take in and that be what inform their behavior and now what the rule class want to do be try to make it impossible to get that word out there and they be go to ensure a violent outcome a a result of that that be what i have be try to prevent from day one and that be what i have be try to tell my viewership and listenership that it be your personal responsibility through your action to help prevent by teach people true morality and unfortunately we be fail in that job collectively we be fail in that job and you be go to see the result of that failure in the physical world these people believe that all alternative viewpoint of reality perspective of reality be to be ban and banish and even possibly make illegal okay people who do not accept their worldview a it be put out there by the mainstream medium and the government and other official or expert be not to be challenge and they be to have their right strip from them if they do not accept that worldview well i do not accept your worldview i believe my knowledge be far superior to yours and i m not afraid to tell you that the real reality of this be be no one have the right to force a worldview upon others we have the right to speak what the truth be i can not ultimately force it on anybody i could just show an ignorant person how they have be deceive but just like i can not force my worldview on other people no one can force their worldview on me or others because here be the truth of the matter folks government medium and even scientist be not the arbiter of truth truth exist independently of any human be be perception of it it be our goal to bring our perception into alignment with that which be namely the truth and we have to do that through a rigid truth discovery psychology and take in high volume of eclectic information from all over many different source even those we do not agree with put them all together logically weed out all inconsistency so that we distill it down to the base essence of that which be true and only then can we say we have an accurate understanding of what be take place and most people do not do that process lady and gentleman i do do that process and i m not go to have people that do not do it tell me what i must believe because an expert say it i will perform the truth discovery methodology process on the information myself and come to my own conclusion about it and so should everyone else so no one be gon na tell me other people be the arbiter of truth no one be the arbiter of truth not even me not you not anyone a an individual their conclusion do not mean that it be the truth and their conclusion can not be violently push upon others that be what be unfortunately take place in our world people with no knowledge just completely give into fear and the big fear be fear of the unknown because fear of the unknown be what hold people back from knowledge and high awareness see if you fear knowledge because you fear what you might discover it be go to create a feedback loop of fear because fear come from lack of knowledge those who be inform be not in fear ignorance be what create fear refusal of truth be what create fear i have no such fear because i have accept what truth be and i have align my perception to it but here be where we be at folk societally this be what self mastery be all about understand the law of the universe understand natural law and then actually apply that true spirituality in one be life through our behavior through our action in the right way through right action the next way out be self respect true respect true look again at the quality of ourself a an individual self respect be the true healer you want to cure the real human sickness then apply the true healer which be self respect first and foremost this be the development of internal courage to look at the truth and then to speak the truth publicly not just to your family and friend where you think it be safe it need to be out there publicly in a courageous way where you be tell people i m not afraid you know turn off the lie fearmongering state control medium it be an affront to self respect stop believing that others have the right to command you there be no such right there be no such moral right this be the way out true courage courage be the universe be protection it be universal protection we talk about you know protective equipment you know to shield u from illness this be the real universal protection to shield u from spiritual illness that be what courage be be bold and mighty force will come to your aid the people who be step up the people who be say no we be not go to have this we be gon na go back to our life we be not gon na take government mandate we be not gon na take government command because you do not have the right to command u we be free and we be gon na act like it you know step into that kind of courage create the universe be protection i m protect because i m not afraid i m not afraid of what can be do to me in the physical domain and you know what real protection be go to come in the form of step into the courage to teach natural law that be a spiritual understanding if you exercise courage for the right thing and you teach the right thing and you teach natural law mighty force of creation will come to your assistance and aid in your life in all your endeavor and that be where my protection come from so we have to say the lost word which be no and we need to fall in love with it this be the lost word we have to say no to evil we have to say no to authoritarianism we have to say no to worldview violence we have to say no to external control no one have the right to externally control rule or command u and we need to fall in love with that word that be a vibratory energy of courage and protection the word no no you do not own me no i be not your slave no you do not have the right to command me and others no one do so folks it look like this the lost word through the knowledge of natural law a truly awakened human be be finally able to speak the lost word which be no no be the word of all power and only when we say no to those who would claim to be our owner do we stop externalize our power and in do so reclaim all of our natural right and that happen when we start to say no to those who would claim to be the ruler of our life the word no be another form of the word on we say no we d turn on the light

farmer should become more competitive
you be nomadic blogger it be good but it be not mean you do well analysis on any topic it fact that bjp govt roll back decision due to election in up mainly it be may be create setback in west up but it be very imphatic setback for our economy
support farmer if you eat food
apmc will be compel to give proper value above msp so a healthy trading will start apmc and corporate will approach farmer simultaneously so good price they can achieve culturally backwardness be main problem of all future consequence of all exist law
shameless rioter
there must always be a separation of government and corporation when they mingle government have too many drink and get irresponsible and the citizen be the one that deal with the bad choice we need more people to serve in the government for their citizen interest and those interest alone
the bill be to benifit the farmer
sadly farmer be fool into believe that they should oppose this law while in reality these be the same law which will benefit them in long run
we be with farmer and every indian

2 if there be an msp maintain be it not like subsidize the agro industry itself and subsidy mean artificially allow the industry to operate at low profit or even loss with an msp in place crop can be sell at low price than should be artificially keep the food price inflation in check at a high level of course there be agent aadtis and middle men who take away the lion share in way of commission bribe which make the product pricing not too low either but internationally our raw food price be definitely low which benefit the entire nation in term of cheap food available but also be one important factor in citizen produce more more child drive the population up which we have clearly see since the green revolution and hence put more pressure on the same system that it stand on whilst also make sure of more environmental damage so subsidy do not help they only help protect mediocre pricing keep the same farmer peg back and not able to explore good pricing and bring more agricultural efficiency in place imagine netherlands with the proper use of hydroponics and no subsidy they have be able to become the second large food export nation in the world whilst be small than maharashtra

most of urban youth be still unaware about the issue supportfarmers
vox have a good format for make video and explanation unfortunately your plain and simple explanation sometimes leave out a lot of important fact i would encourage everyone to read the actual bill that be pass in both the house and not just rely on medium explanation and perception before form an opinion this be not a comment pro or against farmer but a general observation in this age of rampant digital misinformation one should be very careful and always consume any news piece with a pinch of salt
let consider reliance remember jio bulldozer marketing tactic company buy all future rice bag at a fair price from farmer in india which be not yet to seed which create artificial scarcity in future use it he keep high price than msp which lead to chaos in buyer and where let to a shortage in government state run reaction store poor people can not eat their meal
historic farmer protest
no point in imitate bhakts it do not add any comic instead it bring down all your hard work level of research and seriousness of topic
great coverage although at time it felt you be show a serious matter too lightly perhaps your style and my first time watch your content could you do some coverage and show more about the sheller already ready in various area in punjab for ambani and advani corporation it a clear indicator modi have already make direct plan with corp to sell the farmer livelihood please continue to show u more on this thanks
they will protest on every bill it do not matter it 370 caa or farm bill and for me this pay protest do not matter and you do not matter at all
1 punjab be groundwater be decline 0 5m per year because of grow same crop paddy and wheat year after year
these new farm law be long pending be propose by the rival party when they be in power they be highly important to shape a progressive future for india
some be argue that these bill will allow monopoly by corporate company for example a giant like reliance make deal with most farmer in a particular area so that other trader be force out of that market over time a farmer become dependent reliance start squeeze the price low thus make farmer suffer
in mexico my grandpa get a pro campo to help with the cost but it nothing they grow bean only and each year they get less and less for their bean sometimes someone come into town and say yeah we can sell your bean for xyz so everyone give them their bean and then it end up be a scam idk if my grandpa can continue to keep his land if the price for bean be so low there be also less family over there now to help out they also dont even like to farm
farmer have full right to protest but always encourage them keep peaceful and patience at all time the world be watch you closely through many channel i remember the word mera bharat mahaan hai ek bhimisal desh hai
i watch it for entertainment it be not journalism
wonder how mainstream medium would cover this tonight after all they be hail modi for these historic law
ravish kumar the isi agent should be send back to pakistan

bjp try to suppress farmer
that be how to bring down an arrogant government you have to make a sacrifice and farmer do so well well do
32 why do you not mention the assault on police personnel during the violence if the way these farmer have assault our police men and woman to the extent of mow down them use tractor even in usa uk or for that matter in south africa the police would have fire shot at them however they do not they excercized restrain
just superb but problem be that sab sath khade nahi hote yahi karan he ki tut jate he nirbhaya case me hue the sath tod diya tha uske baad na ho sake isiliye tut rahe he
one of the best video superb coverage of farmer protest
this too have be do by the modi govt to avoid the farmer be union and the congress from go on into a chain of nationwide protest which would have subsequently rattle the bjp base and if this chain of protest be to be hold the bjp would never be in the political picture keep in the mind the assembly election in many state in the forthcoming month
why i be so shock by modi ji decision why he be take back i dont get it so shock and surprise this should not have happen modi ji why you bend in front of this fake farmer why dontcancelfarmlaws keepfarmlawsbills
reform to be hold but in accurate perspective these law fail in big economy in the world now europe have make another law no one can buy crop low than create price than india also have to bring the msp law reform and it can bring independence in farm sector
it not violence to fight for your right we dont need a visa to be in delhi if you try to lock someone out of their own house they will fight back delhi be not modi s house it a part of india farmer have a lot more right over delhi and the land of india before any corrupt politician
farmer bill be 100 right decision by modi government
and after two year the same private company will buy the same crop at a very less price
750 poor meek farmer have brutally kill by fascist modi bjp have to be uprooted
writing be on the wall modi will fall negative comment against farmer and protest aint gon na change anything so u can cry all u want kutta bok ta ha bok na do
before say anything trevor should make everybody understand what these three farm law really be
you can not kill them a you be kill them now ruthlessly
congratulation to all farmer and citizen of india bharat
bhai agar itne problem thi jab msp lago kiya tha tab khuu nhi protest kiya farmer ne or government jab baar baar ke rrhe he ki msp farmer against me nhi he msp unke support me he rathee
rioter and broker win nation and poor farmer fail
this be bad and highly deplorable jitni ninda ki jaye kam hai responsible police officer should be sack
news in it true form and the actual emotion of the farmer be rightly document in this video hat off to lallantop
be an indian who have unconditional support for these farmer i can say that this be the best explaination on this issue period once again vice show how journalism be do hope lapdog of indian medium come to their sens and stop suck up to an incompetend radical right wing govt
i m a student of agriculture i need to mention a point here when u tell govt can hire trainer to train farmer for practise unconventional agricultural process actually the system be already present lab to land where extension officer and worker apply those technique in field level bt prblm be lack of officer and infrastructure also govt be callousness be responsible
they should have read bill carefully
i feel like he should have explain it more but i still cant find anything wrong with these law
bjp be rule india like taliban i feel be in afghanistan the way what be happen in up and modi and yogi be proud of it shame on modi yogi and bjp
this be not complete information you address only some fact which be show this bill be not anti farmer but it be not reality
whole summary will be there be nothing to protest but protest happen to make rule party to come on it be knees by let it into vulnerability of victim fiasco with have preconceieved notion of rule government be fascist but which be absolutely not but in reality it be most pussy footing moderate government i have ever see in indian history due to this government pussy foot this protest go so longer the real question be why this protest be go so longer inspite the clause to clause negotiation of farm bill be on card any law be negotiate but here it be not negotiation it be pure pure and pure rebelism
we should learn from punjabi
now kisan will get justice on their own kisan ekta jindabad
thank you dhruv rathee for make this video on the protest against ordinance it be very informative
but i do not understand why do not u tell in this video that why govt be not ready to give permission to farmer to pettion in the high or supreme court if any dispute occur in contract farming sorry but not agree with u
madam for your info two bill new and one be amedment ha
up me election hai 2022
modi do not know and have no experience of deal with the jat jaat power these guy be martial race and will make history by defeat a fascist regime jai hind
first canad govt should answer how bloch girl kill by isi of pakistan in canada be khalistani and pakistani involvement in it every indian want to know this first answer this question then we will answer you what be our farm law
this will be consider the most disastrous decision of modi government this be never expect of him i be pained and terribly disappoint i lose my trust in him
second there be no rule that in market produce will be sell buy at msp only only govt procurement be guaranted at msp
i think the farmer on the right way protest be their right and they r go on the right path for themselves and the nation
good information and agree with you may india be save
prime example of this be the pepsico v farmer case in up punjab and gujrat be lay refuse or slash the prise to buy the patato a the produce be not a per set standard and the farmer dint have the right to go to court and the dm give result in favor of pesico
i do not know why all this reporting have not mention the horrendous number of suicide a it be due to govt induced bad farming practice in punjab that lead to enormous poverty a it be
do u all know govt openly request farmer to come and discuss which line in farm law they think be bad govt will remove it
mr sharique please continue to do these kind of current significant video
they may be just postpone it so that farmer lose hope or lose momentum or tire out
there be nothing wrong in the farm bill this give so much more flexibility to the farmer since they can sell their produce to whoever they want to without get into the clutch of the monster of apmc there be always 2 side to a bill like this only time will tell u if this be actually a pro farm bill
kisaan nhi to desh nhi we support farmer
one crucial element in this protest be fear a big chunk of farm constitutes middle man worth of middle man be in million billion this middle man fear he would lose his say in the whole process
these be the three farm law in a nutshell the agitation be basically against change and also due the fear that middle men would be squeeze out if farmer have direct and open access to market
see this video on 2x speed you will find that he be pro legend
sir this bill also say you can not go to court to solve the matter please mention that too
bad politics be reason why india not able to develop till now
hand off dude for the explain this but i do have question for you a you have tell that msp should be in law but the fact be that accord to wto it be highly price in india so we be not able to legalize it even if the govt want it so come back to qus what can we do in this stand still situation
these noobs read to bill and it be consequence video be just a drama like other news channel
and these be the people who be support or oppose the bill
india globalisation nte part akumbolum same corporate and privatisation fear ayi ipolath exist govt party vare vannirunnu ipo enthayi i think it be good for farmer if they implement this properly
why the farmer others r on the road seience five month
2 in second bill there be choice for farmer to sell directly the apmc and map be still there so where be the question of government get out of agriculture market again more beneficial to farmer
india must change it farming policy and practice farmer need to be provide reasonable support by the government so that they can make a decent living and not poison the land at the same time farmer need to revert to traditional farming practice so that they do not kill their soil with toxic pesticide and fertilizer they also need to go back to crop that can have small water requirement in order to deal with global warm farmer need to wean themselves off of fertilizer and bio engineer crop impose by the indian government eventually an impending disaster be in the making in which farmer will be leave with poisoned land increase debt low yield and inevitable famine india be a major power should be set an example for other country to follow not create ecological disaster that will make them laugh stock of the third world the whole problem with india be corruption hopefully they will mature a a nation and realize that reliable and competent government be simply a good solution for everyone
govt be right i support modi

the non bjp party supporter who have come to protest the visit of dycm keshav prasad maurya be leave back for home a dycm change route on see the convoy of bjp partymen go to meet dycm they attack bjp partymen and their driver with stone and stick which have lead to the vehicle go astray and cause accidental mowing of some protestors who be there consider that the farm law have be keep in abeyance and be challenge in supreme court such violent protest should have be avoided people of india already witness the horrify farmer lobby drive tractor fast and furious to kill policeman during republic day besides bring down indian flag

i understand that every law be not perfect but do not mean that you will only show dark side in long term it will benefit farmer and country
i didnt like your explanation because he only talk about the exist system you be suppose to tell u about the new farm loan and you do not even mention one negative point about that you do not mention that how msp be not grant in the new rule and how this can be exploit youre just go round and round about the same old exist system to prove how it be bad
one more most people in support of bill be say that msp be there yup a pm say msp be there but msp should become a law
these law be take back not because that gov take care of farmer u understand what i say
whr be all the celebrity who tweet and do social medium support why they be not come to support farmer
godi medium try to hide something
withdrawl of law be a big loss to indian farmer and common sense big win for anarchist and those who wish to farmer in perpetual poverty now no politician will dare to reform this sector
i support this bill
should keep go farmer do not starve you do
farm bill be very important coz we always wait and depend on price maker i wish the dealer be come to u and deal with u
i think government and farmer should really come to the table again and resolve through dialogue otherwise we be set horrible standard for our democracy in future not just for this government but any government that will be in power
who care we all know that this be more like a political protest n not a farmer protest shameless creature wan this to be continue

and this be how indian show gratitude to punjabis for give 80 head for freedom then they say punjabi be terrorist if they ask for their right
think of it a any other industry let be say scooter in india it completely private million of indian people need scooter and continue to buy it from a handful of company technically they could form a cartel and raise the price together make a massive impact in the indian marketplace but do that really happen no because free market also encourage competition and especially in today be day and age if 10 company come together and raise price a new company will get set up see the discrepancy in margin pricing that they can take advantage off of simultaneously if they keep the price artificially low lure more and more people to buy scooter a they will have low margin and b once the demand pick up there will be more raw material require to keep up with the demand which would put pressure on the raw material resource and drive the price back up again else it will not be sustainable for the company to begin with and they will go bankrupt if they continue to sell the scooter at low price than what they can sustain

hi please tell me if i be wrong here i be in support of these farm bill that have be bring by the government and i do not think that we need such legal msps or whatever because if party a be in favour of strict msp and party b be not in favour of msp then corporates will support party b in election you can not avoid the interference instead the problem can be solve by incentivising startup because if you have 10 company like bigbasket then you will have competition a company that offer good price to farmer and low price to consumer actually grow a new businessman can reduce monopoly of the old businessman competition in company be crucial for benefit of mankind

all the bill say be it will provide parallel market to the farmer a choice this parallel market already exist in many state of india as well a in many part of the world
the explanation be great kudos to your effort i just have one doubt while cite the negative point for the second bill wherein you tell that farmer will be squeeze when the cost of cultivation be high and the selling price be low the farmer will have no choice leave and the government will not intervene but be not it that farmer can still sell their good in mandi at the msp they still get both the option to sell privately or to government through mandis do not they

with this protest success more protest will come they commit a grave mistake with this but honestly even congress have more gut than them no wonder they run from west bengal
i think in the essential commodity they will have to also include another amendment to also add also a minimum price that the farmer can sell their produce because i feel the competition could get so verse that even these guy could buy the produce from farmer at the cheap price later in the future that could drag the industry to rock bottom
a farmer they have atleast their own land

the best video i ever see in this protest thank u soo much for cover this respect and support for farmer
it take 365 day and about 700 valuable life and thousand injure for some crocodile tear and i half hearted apology what a shame

this be the kind of medium coverage we want to see thank you
very very very very good farmer
it be time for a farmer be revolution in india
the protest by farmer be 100 genuine then it the govt that be spread propoganda and blame everything on opposition
due to this bjp win in every election

bro every thing look beautiful on paper but it be go to hit farmer hard
and this be the fate of democracy what it mean be democracy be in the hand of the wrong people who do not know the meaning of democracy
you always against bjp
so wrong price outside of apmcs will always be low why bcoz if corporates have to pay high directly to farmer they would just simply go to the apmcs and buy from there
bjp will not survive in india for much long
this be the best explanation for the so called corporatisation that the medium and others be worry about i have watch n number of discussion on this but it be never a clear to me before yes the govt truly need to keep a close watch and regulate the market accordingly
every bill be good but in india there be no one to solve this issue that be the problem
a my opinion sry to say modi jii bt this be lose for farmer
those animation really help me understand the concept i saw numerous video but could not understand majority of what they be say but vox video really help me understand the thing
this farm law be good for farmer modi know this would badly affect bjp in election but he remain strong but unfortunately farmer misguide
help me understand this if farmes want to sell there produce through to mandis they can sell it since government have not do away with mandis if the farmer feel he will get a good deal with the private company he will sell it to them simple a that perhaps i be miss something please help me understand
bjp have totally close their eye and ear
more than that everyone must understand when mo creation must be register in the computer all more than all all must be register so can not lead the public nose i will not give in to some people try to sell their good and drug on the market in india with a duke from pakistan do not have to understand every person that they do not lie anymore have to learn to tell the truth do not want to tell the truth i have nothing to do i will not give up for nothing
hi good priyanka at last come to know be be good at sweep stay home stay safe
true akash bhai you have fight and give sacrifice to win
again a wrong understanding of new farm law the law just give farmer one more option through which he can now sell his product anywhere he wish inter state intra state private govt etc early farmer be only allow to sell in govt market only in their district
shame on india medium and government we feel the same india farmer from myanmar
brilliant way to destroy farmer livelihood this be the same government which tell that they be go to double farmer income
the punjabi farmer themselves do not consume this 3rd rate product and actually eat crop produce in up etc
3 if they will make an arrest make good image in public and will win election
democracy run by majority keep welfare of minority
newton be third law for every action there be an opposite and equal reaction
may the kisans who lose their life watch this victory and they celebrate the victory

farmer fee the world love support farmer
late bill might also result bin monopoly by like of reliance fresh adani agro etc
the best thing for farmer be to work with scientist to develop real work solution that be gm crop proper gm not just blast radiation or dunk seed in chemical like organic seed company do and good safer synthetic pesticide
and that be how modi break his back now everyone will protest for whatever they want khalistanis will protest for khalistan similarly for for a370 rapist murderer thiefs scanner zehadis everyone will change the law and get whatever they want just by protest first lose in 4th gen warfare for the berojgars let be protest for 1 2 year and we will get high pay govt job
now india have high suicide rate of farmer in world
great work guy that be the most apt analysis which even a number of legit medium house on youtube have fail at just subscribe to your channel due to this video

modi be very rough and tough but he havent gut to give a interview without godi medium
this be democracy people be will be paramount
absolute rubbish lallantop walon please tell him to go and actually study the law and not mislead talk nonsense spreading lie
this be how we can now assume that y the bloody bjp be throw away from delhi
what about if apmc get disappear after 4 year where farmer will sell their product to cooperates no way more farmer will suicide
well explain but which farmer have wearhouse it be middleman who stockpile farmer need imidiate money to sow for next season and 85 farmer be small and marginal
now who be responsible for the death of thousand of farmer do pm will take responsibility what have happen this be the result of bjp lose election recently
you have achieve the distinction of be the single most biased and selective person i have see yet
remember nirbhaya protest in 2013 in delhi before parliament and sonia gandhi house the protest just cool down in 2 day delhi jantar mantar protest of anti corruption bill by anna hazare how it go silently and finish now see this this protest be completely dubious undoubtedly no matter how lofty jingoism you might defend it with farmer sentiment
it 1984 for sikh
the conclusion be more important remove the middle man and buy directly from the farmer
why would make them sit 1 2 3 50days you can fool or mislead them 1 2days or week but 50days you all be blind bhakts
ab toh indian news channel se v bharosa uth gaya
also parallelly the govt have introduce kisan rail and a dedicated freight corridor this be also interlink with these law if you could see thing in toto i would suggest you to go through ashok gulati be article on farm bill or someone who be an agricultural economist
the problem be face by both farmer and the nation collectively but the implementation of these law will not have the effect they intend to have for example the hoarding law removal will prevent mismanagement of stock but it will also cause well hoard and then there be no provision against that so exclude such crop from essential commodity just to gain that one law be not the answer a more thorough inspection be need of these law but the government be stubbornness do not help
we stand with our kisan brother from pakistan from sargodha
farmer have get into the habit of baby feed they have to understand they be businessmen but hereditary system have break their land in small parcel take away their pricing power father have to cartelize do direct selling to consumer do brand
ye sirf or sirf jhut bolte he sarkar pta nahi q nahi action le rahi he ye ese man ne wale nahi he
if any farmer need to sell his thing to private company direct then we do not need this bill anyone can do this
the only reason to dismiss those law be upcoming election they might bring them back again ji desh ka kisan 1 sal se sadak par hai u desh mai democracy ki bat krna ek mjaak hai
i think farmer deserve high salary but this be devasting to know that they suffer the most
pm je app say reqest hal desh may berjogare hai rojgar do govt ke arme ho or elatical department water supply or yaqng educate ko rojgar do or political say hatt kar decide karo fast ok sir

i think there be some problem in these bill which government be try to resolve by talk to farmer union but anyone who say scrap all these bill be absolutely wrong fun fact when congress introduce these bill bku bhartiya kisan union that green flag you see in the protest support these bill and bjp mp sushma sawraj oppose it so my advice be go read these law yourself for good understanding dont follow anything or anyone blindly both government and protest

regard msp we can not compare any electronic or other good wth agricultural product since dayby day it will perish and who will buy any spoiled or perished thing the rice even produce frm a single land will not be of same quality so if there be hundred kg seventy will get good price and for the remain price will be low some time at the time of harvest rain may come or lot of problem which can affect the quality and price more than that since india be a member of wto corporates have a choice to buy low cost food crop frm other country and central govt be spend billion of rupee every year in the agriculture sector through various subsidy and scheme and in the newspaper we can check the price of crop daily pls check

after 11 round meeting farmer be still at their stand and 26 of jan what happen every body know
stand up india farmer free india
the word of this feku can not be trust unless the demand of the farmer be implement
when modi govt support swarg lok people
appreciate your clear analyse some point you have raise be hypothetical and for possible concern by farmer however the farmer should have list these issue clearly on the table when discuss in 11 meeting with the government they also fail to cooperate with the supreme court setup committee you may have a clear picture but the farmer union do not secondly what really happen in future be unknown if there be an issue it can be subsequently correct a i see it it will definitely bring good income to farmer my farmer relation be very happy that the middleman who take 2 5 commission in the past have be eliminate with the new law since the farmer do not pay tax on their produce this income be a major contributer to black money the new law will control the flow of fund because all go direct into farmer bank account there be more but i think this issue be so politicalized it benefit the opposition party who be fight for survival and therefore will keep this issue alive for sometime

even today in mandis it be mostly the private trader who buy and there be no requirement they have to pay the msp only fci when do procurement offer msp in mandis allow farmer to sell outside mandis only broaden the purchaser base and therefore reduce the vulnerability of farmer to the clutch of adatiyaas of the nearby mandi say govt want to close mandis and do away with msp be baseless this be scare monger the way caa be depict a a tool to disenfranchise muslim citizen logically why will any govt antagonise the farmer who constitute a huge number in our democracy and be always identify for development scheme and anti poverty program likewise contract farming be only make available a a choice if the farmer be worry about contract he do not have to do contract farming and if ever in future farmer come under distress bcos big big buyer would any government sit and watch

after watch this i certainly know that common people have so much little knowledge of the bill and why farmer be protest it it be like yeah farmer be ask for something and government be deny that also the farming sector be not that much role in our gdp but it straightly provide u with food and contribute a lot in employment the bill be simply to kill the mediator and control the farmer a reliance and big corporate house want to enter into the retail chain system and for that they want to produce packed everything at cheap price it be good but it certainly kill a lof of current employment and uncertainty to farmer the corporates buy straight from the farmer and there be a big chance that they try to dupe farmer to stretch their profit a they get all the knowledge power and money it will make some farmer happy also as long a they be comply with the corporates on the quality and price corporate buy big and store it to late produce that good for a long period of time example you could get tomato at very cheap price when it be produce in abundance process that to ketchup and sell it at a high cost with more shelf life we need to eventually move to that stage a right now the product be not properly be stock and a lot of reliable good be destroy but we government could solve it via prove good storage facility but no government want to remove their hand from this and hand it to corporates anyway this bill sound good just for the people who willing to purchase a tomato can pure than fresh tomato rest it be not that great for farmer and people who buy fresh

the 84 farmer who do not utilize msp do they actually sell for more than msp or even less
i agree that company like jio and big basket will try to give huge incentive to farmer in thier 1st stage of business model but why cant goverment regulate such thing i mean goverment know that ye bid log aage jaake farmer ko exploit kr skte hein if goverment can form a regulatory body who can keen an eye on such big pupil this bill can be a sucess no

you can not become an expert in how indian agriculture work by just read the new bill that be pass to know the pain of the farmer you have to speak to the farmer and know the situation watch this video to know the concern of the farmer of punjab and bihar why the farmer of bihar have be flock to punjab to work and how the agriculture have be destroy by eliminate the mandis we can not sit on our chair in an ac room google a few thing read a few paper and come to a conclusion nobody like to leave their home and spend the whole day and night on the road for week or maybe month

sir i want to add one more point here on paper these bill be like a long pending reform but the ground reality mainly i be talk about small farmer be that farmer have mainly two time income in a year somewhere it be three too but mainly they get money twice a year but expenditure be not limit to twice a year there be school fee every month they also have to buy ration medical expense on festival time marriage n many more these farmer be dependent on middleman aadhtis for money throughout the year for sure private company will not lend money to farmer in advance if farmer have any unforeseen situation like if a farmer need money very urgently his or her family member be hospitalize god forbid here aadhtis help them although they charge rate higher but atleast farmer get money at that specific time this be how the life of small n marginal farmer actually be

hey trevor i really appreciate the way you bring news to people be an indian living in the u right now i still be unclear about the reform a everywhere it be only tell that the private sector gain while the farmer lose which i would stand strongly against if the case be that but what i be curious about be the proposed reform in detail because more than often in india and the country alike the protester be give a piece of information that be claim to be legitimate while the government and the protester never face off a the injector of the agenda ensure that there be always a barrier between them so the protest go on for as long a possible that the protest be against i d love to hear a more detailed explanation of this from you so that everyone know what it really be and act accordingly

sound to me the indian government be make room for white people to move in and take advantage of the agricultural space and the hard work people in india in line with white policy style be the indian government allow itself to be hold to ransom or what make room for capitalism may give a quick boom to the few rich but not to the country a a whole and may even be detrimental if reform be need always think primarily on behalf of the people the overpowered gentry not only garner from it already but can and always will take care of themselves and need to make contact with regular people to grow their wealth so what if the white country refuse to trade with india because there be no open market in the style that make it easy for capitalist to take undue advantage there be a myriad of other country with which to trade nothing to be afraid of you will face risk and potential poverty either way since white country have the power to place untold pressure on other country that do not meet their approval jamaica cuba n korea china off and on country in africa s america and c america etc the country that buy into capitalism be fall apart one way or another usa uk s korea japan etc wield the power of balance power that be the untold reason and enlighten suffering of be elect in the first place

well to shorten the case the law of mandi will remain intact the new law be for something outside the mandis if farmer be skilled enough to produce quality food then instead of minimum selling price msp they can sell it to corporates or restaurant through contract like those do in commodity market and the new law be put these corporates and restaurant or any other bidder to pay the farmer and obey the contract so these law be just another option and that do not banish the mandis option

hopefully this be a learning moment for the bjp part of the problem with the farm law be lack of consultation lead up to it be pass
a lot of capitalist fundamentalist in here that do not seem to think that capitalism be a disastrous system vs a more democratically directed system of investment
my theory be that the bjp govt strategy be to stretch the protest as long a it can so that public will feel the brunt of the protest and revolt against the protestors instead of the govt
shameless pm
i be an indian and a son of farmer also i be totally against farmer protest
tnks for the info i do not know this much
even the june economic report this ministry share that subramanian swamy spoke about show fail indian economy but none of the godi medium talk about it because fanboys do not do that

hey noah one comment if you do not know you do not know you have not research well enough you have just highlight what the cause the farmer protest you do not even touch how they some of them be misguide by politics and foreign force you have not go into detail about the economic impact of the farm law read about them analyze their economic impact before make crappy collude video which in then end achieve nothing but spread misinformation in the end do not contradict your own theme line and make a fool out of yourself please do not blabber crap base on half bake knowledge
bjp know about election side effect
apmc can eat rs 91 per kg and getaway big corporates can not they would need to show on their balance sheet a roce return of capital employ of over 1100 will lead to heavy scrutiny even if big corporates make huge profit say 30 50 roce they could give farmer much more in return than the what farmer get in current apmc model

in the idea of give a neutral view you actually have speak in depth price discovery be very difficult to find in perishable good a production and demand and expense keep on change from time to time and you can not hold your product the best thing would be to create more mandis which will give farmer more place to sell a farmer will not go to a different state to sell only trader will do that government cooperative and investment in cold storage be the way forward however if private company be involve now then cooperative will not form and hoard by private company will happen in big scale american and european agrarian economy be heavily dependent on govt subsidy because of the model that this govt be try to bring kindly talk in dept about the flaw of the present law and mandi system

suppose msp for wheat be rs 1975 for 1 quintal and farmer be sell wheat to private party at r 1800 then government can consider subsidise the deficit of r 175 per quintal however this be dangerous a this will encourage rampant fraud where all private buyer will start offer lower and low price merely to benefit from the subsidy give out from tax collect from the mass

the passing of the farm law be a manifestation of the modi government contempt for the federal structure of the republic and for parliament itself the constitution of india list agriculture a a state subject and yet so far a one can tell the three farm law be draft without any consultation with the state not even with state rule by the bharatiya janata party indeed know how this government function it be very likely that all the drafting be do in the prime minister office with little or no input from cabinet minister not even from the union minister of agriculture unilaterally make decision which affect hundred of million of indian have be a hallmark of the narendra modi government since it take office in may 2014 however a top down one size fit all framework be particularly unwise in a field such a agriculture give the enormous ecological diversity of our very large country when soil type water regime crop practice and land tenure history vary so much between and within state how could the prime minister go ahead with such a controversial measure with no discussion with the state at all

1 why can not farmer form a similar cartel a trader to control the price at which to sell to the trader at least this should be possible with the new farming bill

i believe this be a wise move by the bjp and pm modi i would encourage the government to go far one step and repeal all subsidy that in actual fact benefit the middle man and unscrupulous landlord let each individual state to sort their own subsidy for their farmer in the absence of reform let be see how long these farmer want to continue with their stupidity and opposition when their pocket book start to really hurt furthermore it be unfair for the rest of the country to foot the subsidy bill for state that oppose the farm reform bill who think they know good how to run their farming industry all state that support the farm reform bill should be encourage to enact law for their state to formalise the new law and look towards create common market union among these state for the benefit of their farmer

half of the people dont even understand the true picture of farm law
never support these three bill
key takeaway the price of food will rise which mr sengupta mention while the price pay to the farmer will fall which mr sengupta should have but have not mention the only gainer will be the middle man corporation that have the resource to rig the market the government the regulator the court and the news medium that be why it be in the interest of the farmer as well a consumer to force the government to cancel these bill

on the other hand everthing depend on demand and supply of anything so if any thing be produce in excess no one will purchase at msp except govt and govt can only purchase till it store capacity be not full on the other hand if domestic agriculture produce be itself expensive then international mkt then why one would purchase from domestic market rather they will import from other country such thing will be do that be why only msp can be guarantee by govt but govt can not impose msp on private sector because over all price depends on demand supply of produce and every produce be not of the same quality so msp can not be same of same product with different quality if msp be make mandatory on private sector then bad and good quality produce have at same msp think be it possible then why one would purchase from farmer if something be impose without any benefit yes it be true that a price should be fix a per the demand and supply by the govt that could be impose for a particular time period but not permanently
instead of show whats happen and criticise the bill why not try to show the actual bill and let people decide whether they be right or wrong i think people here be smart enough

you be so naive akashu though you be old but you just have this venom for our govt that be just get poisonous to such extent that you can not see the motive here plus it will end the mouth of opposition and an entry to politics for the opportunist like tikait or dakait we should say and also to all the fake men or farmer now they will cry but for some genuine needy one real farmer i feel happy too
only true journalism channel

government need to keep the apmc to make the adequate supply of wheat and rice in the market india can not afford shortage of these two it gon na be disastrous
all farmer be not against it only some community be
most of the farmer in india be fairly uneducated and live in poverty the problem with bill be that while it promote free market and open new possibility option for farmer it will encourage more and more corporates to enter in agri trade the contract farming will be encourage by these company who have lawyer who will exploit the loophole in system and put clause and condition in the contract to minimise the wage of farmer do you think a farmer will make round of court when it do not deliver on the contract due to bad weather similarly stock hoarding will be a problem in future a company will play a role in control price and demand just a in stock market do not forget that only thing that matter for corporates be profit
govt should make reform in apmc it should not handover our farmer to corporates
3 the real matter be middlemen powerful and wealthy have completely subvert the issue and make it an identity kissan issue now
indian farmer we proud with u
whenever you talk about news channel why do you mention only republic
however mr khan be specific before choose your word bhakt bhagwan ke hote hai baki to sub chumche hai
i have watch this video more then 10 time whenever i do my answer write on msp farm act 2020 apmc or any agricultural topic i prefer this lecture

shame on the sc bjp r ec and the police for blindly follow the direction of the goverment
mandi reform
if our government have any good intention toward our farmer then why be they treat them so poorly in delhi a you have see these day and if think those farmer be khalisthani then there be no argument leave it be clear that which side our government will stand if anything happen in near future
so i agree with ur all point but 1 thing i want to say agar koi badi company ne farmer se koi bhi vegetable ya fruit etc mangte he and unhe koi bhi problem face karni pade to a per the new law of supreme court at that time the farmer be the consumer and they can go to consumer court for their justice
crystal clear but now govt step back i worry about that why govt take this decision to reveal this act
secondly if they be not pay well by govt then how tf they have enough fuel to run thier tractor for that tractor protest
a big move by bjp whether farmer gain or lose the entire opposition be in a fix a to what to politicise for future moreover 75 farmer do not participate in agitation and seemingly not against the law they may blame opposition too
only say taiyari karra hu should not be consider a criterion fit enough to publish his view a a standard knowledge or fact at least that be what a common man perceive on a reputed channel like yours yes he or for that matter anyone be free to express his her view on any topic and thats why i dont blame him here for anything but only lallantop for present it up a a sensational headline a per the whole act and law be concern i probably know much more about it than him a i have read in detail the present law the past history associate with it the present condition around the world in farm sector and what the future demand also to add on i can probably tell you actual flaw that matter in the act along with a few corrective measure i live in u a a data scientist analyst and pretty sure people will waste no time in hound that what do you know about ground situation of farmer sit there which be fair to say on their part know very little about thing in case 1 in a billion probability though if you might want to have my view or a healthy non political debate and discussion not about only farm law but in general about many other ongoing thing defense brain drain etc i be always up for it jai hind
so without awareness and proper education the sucess of new law would be suspicious
it not like jio uber ola can exploit customer indefinitely because there would come a time when their service might not be that lucrative and hopefully some new player enters market again offer good option and price as long a the market have enough player that it doesnt cause any monopoly it should be okay otherwise government should step in and incentivise more private company to join the game and break these cartel
this prove few can take a majority govt for ransome fear from loose few bypolls that you be ready to put country backward for year

he can not blame congress anymore farmer genuinely believe that their survival be threaten
the simple reason for the poor display of our farming sector be because the apmc be a sham in our country the corruption of apmc and cartel system have degrade it to an extent that it have become redundant i concide that msp be require for the corporate option of sell crop but we have to understand that capitalism do work to an extent and competition in mandis can bring in the change that be much need

i think he will bring the law back after election with some modification
this show how difficult to bring reform in india why after 75 year of independence we be still poor and count in third world country
the very fact that modi choose to repeal the law show that the protestors be actual farmer and not andolanjeevis or khalistanis
i agree with almost everything you say but that soldier hit sardar ji uncle pic be a propaganda image and i be sure you must be aware of this but still you be use the same what message it will give see the problem be with the bill let be be vocal against it and get thing sort why to politicize it and complicate it for no reason baad me mouka nahi milega politics karne ka

second thing modi be never involve with kisans in any meeting his minister be talk only
this turn out happen all over the world but in different sector depend on what those country presumably major asset wether it be to attracts investor to keep the major economic class roll whatever happens be the bottom tier work class be be squeeze out of their future use law and regulation and if there be a protest you know what the government say they will post poned it or reconsider it in some specific time then boom it be already out there without you know it but at least the government have notify it so no no no we can not hear your complain we hear your aspiration we have reconsider it we deem it be necessary to implement it in dangerous time such a this trevor hope you will not be naive love you
if you be wise enough then this bill be good for you but if you be not then you can be in trouble some loophole need to be fix then this bill be good farmer should have more legal protection and msp law

the explanation be beautiful overall but the reality be harsh than this beautiful explanation the loop hole that have be point out in this video or be actually there in the farm act be dangerous indeed the act appear to be a cake walk while read and listen to explanation but while analyse the whole act it appear to be a masterstoke with disastrous loop hole i would suggest the viewer to refer other source as well along with this amazing video govt should not withdraw this act but should amend it largely and in any case hoarding be not justifiable it just show potrays govt on the side of big corporates rather than the poor consumer and farmer the suggestion give by vikas sir be also must need amendment in the whole act but still there be many more loop hole and even more dangerous possible harm in this act that could be happen to farmer so those drawback also need to be address and amend by the govt
4 accord to the new law the farmer be free to sell their produce to anyone they like open the market to private player who could give them a good price than the msp they could also sell it online

no one talk about the amount of expenditure this be all go to cost have association and people who explain the contract to the farmer who will pay them will they be regulate the associaltions or people help the farmer with these contract will they be non corruptible a lot of these farmer be not educate also language barrier and greed of the human where do that end where be it go to be accountable regulated price of commodity help consumer a well price in western country be not regulate that be why mask and hand sanitisers here end up be stock and then sell at exorbitant price you say msp do not help but if you look at it financially farmer in punjab and haryana earn more because of this msp their family be able to eat to get an education and have some form of self respect you also say farmer be think of give up farm because it be not profitable you do not tell why the price of fertiliser pesticide sow reap harvest that be just a few example of the area where the cost be have you ever farm in your life do you know the cost and infrastructure need do you know how difficult it be for small farmer look at farmer from other state they earn far less a compare to the farmer from punjab and haryana yes msp be not something guarantee but that be because the government do not guarantee it and the farmer do not demand it they should be demand high price they the farmer should be decide what the price will be there be no empowerment for them in these law not only that if company be the one to regulate the price why do people cry about onion be expensive the same thing with atta maida daal chaawal this be go to be harder for people all over the country these law should be address in even more depth there be law that say that the land will be take away from the farmer as well what about that take away someone be sole source of income you say that thereis good in these bill that a farmer in himachal can not sell apple by come to maharashtra umm do you know the distance they will have to travel the price of petrol and diesel the number of day it will take to get there forget all that food be a perishable commodity it end up get rotten soon and you would need more vehicle for your produce we have food come from other state already where do you think the rice grow in punjab go to to people who consume rice a lot of people in punjab eat roti wheat atta be what be use to fee the whole nation fact be even if you have give the bad and the best case scenario you have still not address the main issue this video be not even well research the government need to employ more people to create those association also say that if you have already make up your mind then this video be not for you be highly unprofessional if you want people to understand you should research a topic and then make a video to convince people the best and the bad in a bill sure these be the main concern that the farmer have but this video do not even touch the beginning of the issue farmer all around the world be struggle there need to be a shift towards organic food farming but what benefit do that have will the goverment pay the farmer if the company do not farmer in india especially punjab and haryana farm 2 to 3 time in a year to produce two type of crop so they can earn money no one work for free so that mean they have to pay labor a well and if they cant pay the laborer in the field they have to let go of them which mean unemployment small farmer contribute to the economy also do you understand the impact of farm a land for tomato of a particular size color shape etc it mean wastage of food or manipulation of food if food do not grow a particular way the farmer will have to use steriods and injection to get that shape which will affect the health of the consumer which will cost them in health care which again be not something easily accessible and if it be it not of a good quality wastage of food a well come into play a tomato of a particular size will be want by the company and the one that dont meet their standard will be what sell by mcdonalds we couldnt use these so you can buy them the western country be want to stop this wastage of food one store here in the uk sell food that be not of the required standard at a low price it call wonky vegetable example wonky potato wonky carrot wonky apple wonky onion do you even understand what food standard of these company will do to the farmer and environment wastage of food in a country may not seem much of a problem after all we do waste it in religious place but ask the poor what that waste food be for them seriously you should have research properly or ask someone what the impact will be of this if not compare the model i be not against this channel but honestly not at all a well research video sorry and stock exchange be not exactly stable it change where and who will provide the information of these price not only that do you really think the farmer didnt think about these law sure not all be educate but their child be and yes anyone read a bill will be think only about their side because for other people the law be just that another law but for farmer this be their future also the price maker how do you suggest the price someone buy the food will want a low price the one selling will want high price also quality of food differs in each state and place that be why the price end up be different mandis not be set up in every place be the fault of the government also what make you think when they be not able to set up mandis for people earlier this time will be different not only that when the state mandis will disappear the goverment will have to earn tax in some way isnt it so who be go to fill that deficit also the state mandis will disappear that mean the private company will be the only player so even if initially the price might go low due to competition what about in the future they will go lower for the farmer not for the consumer also these index that you be suggest who be go to put up the price you do not talk about quality of the food not only that amul that you be talk about how good be the food quality agar ek hi ko power do toh monopoly hoti hai then who lose a a person who be from punjab and a farmer family and who live in the uk i have see the result of allow private company india can not be a capitalistic country mainly because of corruption a place tp come and pool your produce that be what a mandi be also there will be need land and people to man those mandis vijay maalya jaisi bdi machli ko toh pakad nahi paaye choti machli ko kya kr loge this be not just farmer think about it in an enviromment financial health infrastructure way

fake news

i really appreciate the new law make my the government government have really do a great job in the new law it be mention that farmer can sell their corp by their own price at first farmer use to sell the crop at whatever price they be give by the buyer but now they can sell their corp by their own price only farmer from punjab and haryana be protest on other hand farmer from the state like maharashtra uttarpradesh tamilnadu karnataka gujarat madhya pradesh bihar and many other state be really appreciate this new law

kejriwal sir app wohi the jo yahi farm law ko punjab ke elction ke time manifesto me daale the
really appreciate your way of present all the bill but i would like to point out that gradual weakening of apmcs can hurt the local economy so i would suggest the govt to strengthen the apmcs and then look towards the private enterprise to deal with our farmer so that farmer can have the best of option and let them decide that to whom do they want to sell their produce to apart from that ensure a minimum support price even for the corporates will be a welcome step
govt should work on some important agriculture system like 1 fixed rate of seed fertilizer pesticide or their usage in crop 2 organic or bio fertilizer or pesticide to safe our future 3 improve the system of pac to all state 4 every farmer know about complete package and practise of their crop

the 700 farmer die of covid and old age farmer reject the long awaited reform now suffer the consequence
even though government will not provide subsidy but still the farmer can get his money accord to the legal agreement which be sign priorly
i be a layman and have no political inclination as far a i know the agriculture minister have assure more than once that the msp be very much there so this apprehension seem to be unfounded
but the reality of the government control mandi be that the poor farmer be usually force to sell at whatever price the broker cartel at the mandi decide msp usually come when government procure directly through the fci etc for perishable item like brinjal lemon etc he be force to sell because he can not take the produce back home

i watch patiently 5 00 min for him to explain the reason and still he have not explain it let get this straight punjabi haryanvi farmer be the big beneficiary of msp it a previlige and maybe due to policital reason how come we dont see other farmer from different up in arm secondly the ecommonic commodity act be anachronistic law from 1960s and 1970s it do not allow anyone to stock on certain essential item remove this law will allow entites like wholesale dealer to stock up and help in price fluctuation like in onion and potato there be nothing wrong with this from an economic efficiency point of view a rumi say this too shall pass

legal right take away every indian will be affect by this bill the most unjust imbalance of power the law give immunity to all civil servant central and state government or any other person in respect of anything which be in good faith do or intend to be do under this act or of any rule or order make hereunder so acceptance of the bill give immunity to civil servant against legal action for crime they have yet to commit in good faith indian citizen will be exclude in right to legal recourse it be very dangerous a it erode the right of every citizen
i be modi supporter but i condemn this barbaric action they hit farmer from behind here very soul of our constitution be bleed justice be need law and order must be maintain for all and i appeal to central govt please do not mock our trust on you we want democracy not colonialism

if they can do the original system in india 1e9 people and it work well then we be all in the dark age
all i can say be indian be turn into bunch of hypocrite no matter right or leave wing they will start barking and protesting for every single action take by government i still remember some party oppose the vaccine even they oppose removal of article 370 so india be decay by democracy seamless democracy be sweet poison

becoz medium and people like you show only half part of the story and move one
sir you explain every point so well now i understand the farm law well you be one of the best tutor i have ever come across it be such a complex topic and you make it very simple thank you
100 petrol ho gya wha modi acche din aane wale he jai jawan jai kisan
these farmer have be lead by people who be just promote themselves these farmer do not know who their friend be it be sad
i believe farmer should directly sell their product to consumer i e u why any middle person be there
and government should give msp assurance i know it not that simple then these whole bill will become really beneficial for farmer and farmer will be directly connect to the market and middleman be role will get remove
majority people r enjoy religious bigotry nothing can change now
indian live all over the world want justice for farmer what break my heart be that pm modi have not once acknowledge the agitation of farmer how can the pm show such a indifference how can he ignore the agitation go on for month it just unbelievable and unfair the central government instead of try to understand farmer have activate nia investigation on people who be provide resource to these farmer protester such a feed sanitation and other resource the government want to deter these protestors by attack their support
a policy deal with issue of today but a government need to deal with what might come out of their previous action which be indeed their job and this be how it work everything will have it own pro and con regardless of what they do at very least it must solve the crisis and do some good before it start fuck u over we might be able to dodge or duck the issue later on with steady change but for that we need smart and agile government ready to take decision
by 2024 no student no farmer and no doctor will vote for bjp
lol dude go ballistic on modi verbal attack at it be best however this do not make sense it be almost like they be make nuisance for the sake of it
if the future decision or law be meet with such agitation and get withdraw then there will not be any reform in any sector the fate of uniform civil code population control bill corporatisation of ofb and other govt sector be unknown
farmer be protest in the name of msp but nowhere in the list i see that mention why
respect best wish to all farmer brother who fight and win for their right against dictatorship rule of modi in democratic country
this be informative to an extent but doesnt explain about the entire thing why do you think the so called farmer be only from punjab and haryana why do farmer especially in south doesnt even care about these law punjab and haryana might be enjoy alot of money but still thats not the only state with farmer be it
middleman make sure farmer get correct price lol logic die today

godi medium be the bad
but really height of stubbornness be cross by the govt

why not regulate agriculture with msp let private player to buy atleast at that price govt say msp will still remain but think about it they do not have an obligation to purchase at msp govt can just deny that after private player enter the market just like what have happen in case of bihar since 2006 farmer will have to accept the price quote by pvt player and that be the main concern of this bill
democracy win and salute to our farmer jai hind
continuation of subsidy on current monoculture will do more damage than good small farmer should start with the change to the intercropping with agroforestry

after harvest if farmer get much production
very informative but farmer dont have storage facility storage facility will be with the corporates farmer will be bind by legal agreement before seed too many variable like weather play a big role to determine quality i believe corporates will use these law to maximise their profit if farmer will ask for good price at the time of agreement then corporates be free to say no to such farmer in the abscence of mandis farmer will leave with no choice but to say yes i think bill be heavily load in favour of corporates
farmer be the backbone of india protect them

great leader modiji india true democracy bjp always for india
what a wrong narrative kudos to u bro this bill nothing against farmer we be do all of this here in pondicherry and thamizhnadu simply explain ur cheap politics and mandi mafia small farmer here sell everything by themselves in the market we have contract farming also and we be export to other country shame on u if someone believe u they must be stand in road because u r misleading
this be the first time you speak about farm law modiji desh sub dekh raha hai
this bring a tear to my eye see the resilience in our farmer
most rich farmer be in north india
u hv not speak of the ease of do business of a small farmer across the country without go through the apmc cartel they can go to small business who be make herbal oil to sell their oil seed from up north to way down south of the country without any hassle snd all online too
ache deen ayenge agli baar modi jyengee godi medium show them anti nationalist
do you know farmer in india do not pay income tax despite the fact that there be tax slab to take care of poor farmer why be it that none of these people cry injustice when investor in india have to pay income tax dividend distribution tax and later individual income tax with additional ce for the sake of subsidize their produce that no one be go to buy and be probably gon na end up with rat and insect in some govt warehouse these people should feel shameful that first they leave the nation that they now call home for a good lifestyle in a developed nation but when india implement reform to go in the same direction they have guilt the government into regress back to a licence raj regime
i think properly federal structure to be give to farmer
farmer r work in field not protest all foreign funding to unrest in india these thing r happen
they will pay more to thekedar s and india would lose million of ton of grain because of faulty logistics
your be bias man and very negative in approach dont under estimate our farmer they be use very expensive car do you want barter system to be implement shame on you sir like your class regard share but not this one
yeah so it be well to open market for farmer citizen make a nation strong where we have citizen who make cartel against farmer the hard worker to get undue profit it be very difficult to progress people of this nation need to change and stop exploiting or find loop hole in law law be for the betterment of society when will people understand that
time stamp be not applicable for your lecture sir aapki ek ek baat geeta ka shlok hai naman
you completely miss about farmer produce organisation and how it can save small and marginal farmer
if you want to stay poor not modi even god can not help let the farmer decide their fate now get carry away with fool be the best solution for them a of now but they will repent for their unethical mindset and behaviour later in future
msp be not possible because of wto agreement the current condition be terrible for the farmer the act may or may to lead to similar condition but by demand to discard the bill farmer have score an own goal they get fool by the opposition politician
be it possible that this may lead to corporation have too much power over the farmer yes in fact it be likely be that result situation bad than farmer be off in the last 10 year unlikely that be the truth of the matter of course the local government have convince the people who it have strong tie to and the bjp decidedly do not that give all the power to them be the best scenario
obviously we student understand that that be why we sfi protest in our area support our annadata
maam i have a little doubt about that art 122 which u explain that some immunity give to parliament that sc can t interfere on kt proceeding but u also tell about three condition i e untouchability illegality and irregularity so finally be farmer or any citizen can make complain go against over parliament in sc for it be wrong bill
they need to learn about no till and use more compost tea for the soil grow food
commerce wale teacher aesa kyu nhi padhate bhagwan sirf paisa chahiye ye bhi to ek law hi hai sir hum commerce wale student ko guide kre ias se jyda hard to ca hai nhi phr bhi hamare teacher ne aesa padhate

big cheer to farmer he want his name to be itch everywhere what a shame
let be be honest about one thing everyone be a bargain hunter the middle class do not like to pay more and the farmer feel they be not get enough most of the stuff about private company be merely speculation and much of it can not be totally disregarded but think of it logically currently you have a cartel system that be equally as bad a crony capitalism if not more one of the reason for a cartel be that you have restrict the market the free market will simply dismantle this head on a more player will come in once restriction be lift the first thing these company would do be boost supply chain efficiency instead of squeeze farmer or the middle class it would be year before we would be under any threat of crony capitalism grant some of the most talked about surname have the money to get themselves involve in agro but they be not the only one with money in fact itc be the large partner of farmer and not the fancy surname that be be thrown there be risk but there be much more reward under pressure govt can leave these bill to the state government or roll back the reform but don t expect farmer suicide or farm loan waiver to come down

hello we in the usa do this to our society and economy first with the same devastating result occur from 1915 until the 1990 be and still occur today we have the same problem and require the same answer nobody will accept the answer because it mean total economy collapse and reset the polyculture movement be great but it cant price compete without an end to the subsidy and even the current farmer do not want that because it to scary to imagine the intense economic and asset struggle it would cause for them and the temporary food shortage and massive price fluctuation that would ripple for over a generation through the entire population ultimately it would create a massive demand for farmer again if we end subsidy and push any society that do that back to an agricultural economy but india have even less flexibility to do this because if one country in the world usa and china use the method and they can trade freely with your country without tariff and limitation they will undercut your farmer and your society become destitute like the many third world nation unable to subsidize their agriculture because they be to poor and in debt to the imf

you have explain it very well but the thing be that opposition party want to go their to do only politics they maybe worst the situation let supreme court and law and order to take action

just one question if these farm bill be so good then why do the union minister harsimrat kaur who be from bjp resign and why be there such a hurry to pass these law in the parliament when due to corona all the member be not present the only reason why farmer be protest be because they want a strict law on msp and modi a it be he be not a man of his word say that there will be msp then why dont they make a law on it the second thing be under this law it not mandatory for a company to make a write contract with the farmer for any contract farming so even if the company violate the term of the contract the farmer can not prove it and also can not fight this issue in the house of court and nobody ask you about what the congress tell in their manifesto and shit the topic be on farmer the government in centre should be ask question because they be the one who make the law not the opposition i use to think that you guy be genuine but no you both be nothing but a bunch of stupid literate bhakts who be portray a good picture justify each and every step take by their modig be good in evry way

the government be main approach be to cut off the various middle men link that exists in the country because the supply be reguated at least twice before reach the city or town market the different tier of middle men create their own profit which indeed exploit the original price which be earn by the farmer if the law will cut out these men then most probably farmer can earn good price but the implementation sparkle protest because many of these farmer who be out here protest be themselves part of local trade link or have not clearly understood the government be plan also i personally think it be because the congress political party have fund punjab farmer a punjab be a congress state and the party have influence there to simply defame bjp central government and a you can see the protester be all punjabi and not even a single person can be see who be not punjabi
and why someone from government be not give a proper answer it seem so much busy into south election they be mad to change the name of state and city development need not namkaran change name will not solve problem which be big then that

farmer protest be right because if trading start outside mandi then minimum support price msp will be not there and initially they will get high price but the mandi will collapse soon and after mandi collapse since there be no msp the farmer exploitation will start and big company trader will purchase in very low cost outside mandi without tax and legal support pressure

the video give contradictory statement at one place you say that only 6 percent farmer benefit from msp while at another place you seem to worry about impact of probable removal of msp on farmer be income government have categorically say that apmc and msp will be retain hence a farmer have now the freedom to choose either apmc msp or free market a you say msp be only applicable for 22 item if the free market or contract farm with a private firm be not offer sufficient amount the farmer can turn towards msp all private player be not predator please see the e choupal system of itc how much time a hoarder can keep potato and tomato your solution of improve the apmc system be naive kindly tell me any place in india where you have a efficient bureaucracy there may be some individual bureaucrat who be efficient but these be isolated case i think these bill may be a game changer similar to the reform of 91 protest be politically motivated congress include this in their manifesto but now protest a they do not want to cede further space to bjp i think farmer should form a group in a village or may be in a block this may give them more bargaining power against the corporates collective effort may give them more economic power also so that they can employ a legal expert while sign contract please see video by shekhar gupta in the print

1 law there will not only be big company small company which require less input can buy from small farmer also
your assumption be wrong when you assume that there will be no competition in market space of uber and ola
2 if it be to protect farmer why no msp
it be clear that these bill will only benefit the owner of modi amit shah
in the mandi system all the profit go not to farmer but to the middleman and many farmer want an option to get independent and sell out of mandi so only a large percentage of farmer have support the law and the rule party i e bjp win all the state poll and bye poll with a huge margin hold after the introduction of farm law
can supreme court talk about the bill on the basis of due process of law

initially i have so much respect for the farmer and their peaceful protest but now they lose it who give them the power to break government property especially the delhi state government bus by show stunt in the tractor secondly the flag symbolize the sikh religion rather than a farmer protest if they be eager to host a flag in red fort they can make the indian farmer logo with it we all know that the indian flag be above all whether you be a common man or a protestor you do not have any right to disobey our flag which be a criminal offense at last one thing i can say they lose the sympathy

farming be a low return of investment venture in large country like india a the gov should ensure low food price for the mass while keep the subsidy to ensure minimum survival of farm often it be loss making and farmer go bankrupt now the gov like to bring in big corporate intermediary they buy from farmer sell for high price but keep all the profit currently many state govs act a intermediary themselves for main crop like wheat and rice small local intermediary also exist and should offer a good ask price than the state govs if the central gov mandate the replacement of state govs with corporates their asking price go down offer low price than state govs but also sell for a low price initially eliminate competition ie small scale intermediary big corporates would also invest and lock in farmer ie restrict them from sell to anybody else once the competition be out big corporates would rule
a couple of direct question have you go through the farmer bill in detail have you see the protest on 26th jan do you believe in negotiation or violence if you believe in negotiation then which step do you take to control violence instead of upload your view on a global platform vice
if you can repeal farm law like this without any discussion you can amend the law by add or delete provision if one section of society do protest like this and then ready for demand of hindu rastra you have no idea i can guarantee you more than 60 of the population can demand hindu rastra and you have to back off

1 the farmer produce trade and commerce bill just say that all type of agri trade will be allow even outside state regulate apmc mandis so now anyone can trade within the state or across the state all over india and it can be physical trade or online trade and the most important thing be if vivek open a mandi market for trade of agri commodity ether i be procure from farmer and sell it to retailer in my physical mandi or i open an online portal just like amazon anywhere in india then no state can put any kind of tax charge on agri transaction
first foremost why can not the state intervene to abolish tenancy in punjab haryana so farmer have no obligation over the state like in other state secondly instead of create confusion the state must insist that no land stay untilled do not give right to the farmer to sell their agricultural land for any purpose other than cultivation

they keep away from agriculture for 1 5 year but it do not affect the nation be agricultural backbone because the real farmer be in their field and middle men be on the road this be the fact

hence in case of price rise government will accord to subclause i and ii will regulate the price
you believe that make msp legal will solve the problem the problem with msp be that it have to be decide by someone or a team of some people who have their own limitation the free market have a lot of feature which automatically decide the price a just and fair whereas individual or team of individual will never have the same power hence even if msp be make mandatory make the price fair for both the farmer as well a the buyer be go to be a very costly and error prone endeavour for the government which will also be never end
in the end u mention land ceiling act detrimental to farmer how

farm law be good for farmer
it be good that the farmer be protest the govt can not have it own way all the time
in conclusion a good strategy be capacity build behavioural change to make farmer educate motivated and increase investment for that long term income support for farmer be almost a necessity
from this explanation farmer also need to be train to have good understanding of the best price for their produce instead of keep our farmer in a perpetual state of ignorance or poor farmer can not handle or understand these legality or smart application when ado we want our farmer to have smarter mean apps and appropriate understanding of their own profession do we want them to remain where only govt decide on the msp and these middle man play their game with them hope farmer must be give a chance to decide where their interest lie and sell where they want at their negotiated rate people like you and lawyer who want to give service to farmer must help them to become more independent

love your video in general but this one fail to address the key question that it itself raise how can you justify msps for produce that india have in such large surplus the answer be you can not the free market in the end be the best known mechanism to bring price to the reality of the true worth need of the produce hence the price fall without this and with continued subsidization support only unsustainable practice will ensue such a overuse of water burning of field that increase polution in delhi and overuse of fertilizer that you yourself mention not a very balanced video especially due to the fact that many liberal economist support the reform

so use the pandemic to impose unfair law and restriction upon the farming community when they protest accuse them of irresponsibility and breach of quarantine
well explain however i d want to respectfully point out that there seem to be either a mild anti government bias or a little bit of ignorance you leave out certain envisaged benefit of the bill for example in point 2 due to inter state sharing of produce the food wastage can be mitigate the condition where one state be hungry and the other be waste a surprlus will be avoid this will also bring down overall price on the national scale
sir jaise aap solution dete hai agar aap election ladke jit jaye ta hamare acche din aa sakte hai please join any party and win

1 scale accord to a report almost 87 of farmer in india be small and marginalised farmer who work on less than 2 hectare of land it mean small farmer because of their scale have to buy the input like seed fertiliser etc at retail price small scale lead to high cost of transportation proportion to crop these farmer mostly do not have the mean to store them to themselves so they mostly have to sell them immediately in the market and consider the transportation they mostly have to sell them at their village itself and also consider almost all other farmer in the village might be do to same thing so it basically flood the market and well demand and supply come into play make them receive less income and on top of that less bargaining power lead to easier exploitation of them by the middle man now mandi system make the last part of sell a bit more safe with government oversight to make sure at least they get somewhat of a fair price but again it do not solve the entire issue

you be absolutely right but if the farmer be educate they will not be farmer
happy birthday raj singh ji great great lottsss of love to dadaji
these idiotic minister and company should be boycott
second it be extremely offensive and false information you be spread by say that the government want to move out of agri business by bring the second bill after the second bill the farmer will simply have the option of alternative marketing channel in addition to mandis this definitely go on to prove that the government will very much stay in the game of agri business earlier the farmer be force to sell only through mandis even if they get well price elsewhere simply because transaction outside mandis have no legal validity but now the farmer can legally sell outside the mandis if they get a good bargain in case the farmer do not get good price through alternative marketing channel they can always come back to mandis and sell at msp now regard your point wherein you say this benefit only the large farmer and not the small one once the private player enter the scene they will take the initiative of outreach towards small farmer to get their produce provide it meet their cost requirement thus even small farmer will have good marketing chance a of now it be difficult for small farmer to take their produce to mandis on their own for sale
so it be good for farmer be or need some improvement in 3 bill
real farmer only look to sell of their product on fair price to the effort they put
modi work for the welfare of the farmer
i think if implement this could be helpful for poor farmer who be exploit by intermediate agent in the mandis but to implement this will take a lot of time and opposition

and also if msp be set low than what farmer be expect then it a total mess because no one know about climate and the order of produce different vegetable say for example farmer potato msp be at hood level and have security that potatoes wont spoil and on other hand there be tomato which have high chance of spoilage and also have low msp compare to potatoes preferably at a level once this thing will happen that majority of farmer produce potato and than it be in huge amount and waste of everything and mark the scarcity of other vegies

furthermore with the unarguable evidence of violence during these protest attack police destroy public and private property physically attack people with oppose view not only in india but also overseas etc the involvement of and the solidarity with certain terrorist movement and the sheep herding carry out by big rich farmer who have unambiguous political motif as well a direct stake in the mandis it become abundantly clear that this movement have no legitimacy any more if at all to begin with

i wonder why punjabi american dont protest against the american government after all they enjoy the fruit of the free market in u but when it come to poor farmer in india they must remain shackled by labour and farmer union
the farmer need their voice to be hear and if they be do peaceful protest it wouldnt get medium coverage to be honest
ofcourse new regulation should look out for farmer but perhaps deregulate the sector and allow corporates to operate would mean cheap price that would benefit all indian and not just one particular sector

accord to my point of view farmer bill be good for them as well a consumer however accord to my knowledge farmer be not protest against the bill but middle man be trader and company be lead the protest however do you realise that why westbengal farmer be not protest against the bill why hariyana delhi etc farmer be protest against the bill just because of government purchase if this bill will pass then all the farmer will take the same amount price which mean some farmer will receive more price and some of them will take less price spesaly hariyana and delhi farmer also middle man be will have to sacrifice their high amount of profit
the graphic be confuse and i wonder how the landlord fit into this picture a i understand it most farmer pay rent for use of their land

there should not be any middle man with farmer
only punjab and haryana where apmc be most developed structure whereas other state lack of structure apmc or they abolish apmc act thats why only 6 of farmer get msp on their crop we need just apmc in every state structure it every 20 km so farmer will sell their crop easily thats the issue no one talk about in congress menifesto they promise same structure for every state
we the people of india should study more and watch less
finally government take back their three agreement
if farmer do not want that law then gust cancel it
farm law be best for farmer there have be big land lord oligarch which be oppose it because they dont laid punjab do be an industrial hub they want punjab to plunge into an old model a we see how gujrat maharastra now up hyderabad be transformed agriculture economy dont create most job be land productivity be limited water be also run off in this matter of farm protest only this poor henchman lord be win not these people many of my relative live in punjab they be absolutely happy for reform but we have regret that govt knee down in front of these draculian land lord

accord to my knowledge similar concept be present in u where farmer can sell there production to any one but it fail because business men be naturally profit maker and the reason farmer be survive there be the incentive they get from the government to continue agriculture a you know the farmer there be much more educated than the indian counterpart and the fact that they be still be exploit justifies the fear of indian farmer

observation do you think these law be for farmer they be for hecking buissnesmen farmer do not need to sell crop to corporates which will give them less price with loss they want to sell in mandis with msp minimum supporting price which be cancel in this law corporates need to buy crop to sell on high price they notice that meanwhile in corona outbreak which i do not think exists but that be a huge talk right their so no all the department go in loss but farming department do not go in loss at all but if they want to buy crop from farmer directly they can not cause of previous law and if they buy from mandis tax 6 fucking tax so yeah the new law allow them to buy from farmer directly if you be be over smart and think your point of view pronounce in fat voice yeah bruh but farmer can also sell in mandi if they do not want to sell to corporates me yes but corporates will give high price for first 2 3 year and give greed to farmer to sell to them but then mandis will fail because nobody will sell to them and the corporates will rise low crop price because their will be no option for farmer to sell to another people then farm fail people sell their land to corporates and the the price of crop rise corporates will gain profit long term game bro 2 farmer need to store crop they grow them and sell they do not need to store them huhh but corporates do need to store bet you didn t knew about that do you they store and sell i live in punjab and i notice that many basement type building be be build on highway be sideways think 3 they cant even complain

i feel like even after this bill some people will find new way to exploit them
excellent video two point 1 contract farming could still be exploitive a the farmer bear the risk of reduced production and yet sell at low than market price during surplus production quality clause be loophole that could be exploit by the buyer to avoid buy all the produce the farmer make 2 the lack of legal validity of msp be suppose to be counterbalance by a govt buyer the food corporation of india which be assure to be outside cartals because it be not a private entity the concept of govt own corporation to break monopoly or cartel be use in some country eg france and be anathema in others eg usa india belong to former group with company like bsnl fci ai etc exist to prevent monopoly and cartelization the current govt seem ideologically inclined towards dismantle this model

yeah guy the issue be really not clear here the msp be not for the market it for the government govt have to buy the wheat to distribute in the rationing system now the farmer use excessive amount of chemical fertilizer and pesticide to maximize the production quantity over quality since they have the assurance that govt have to buy it now the govt buy this huge quantity of poisonous wheat every year and distribute to the country be ration system what else to do who be mostly dependent on ration the poor of the people then this low quality chemically contaminate wheat cause serious decease in the poor indian which be really really bad do you know that most of the people in punjab do not eat locally produce crop

i think that the bill have two flaw 1 the removal of msp outside apmc market which be bad 2 the non interference of the government in sale of agricultural commodity outside apmc i e in private market there could have be strict law accord to how private company can enrich the farmer rather than impoverish them for their own profit making purpose for company charge less than msp there can be strict tax law or penalty for them

great summation and agree we need to be look at this
it in farmer hand how and where and when they want to see till they dont come into any agreement with the private organisation regard their growing of vegetation they can sell accord to themselves if they be free from any bind it on farmer if they want to sell to any government body or anywhere in net farmer should decide completely in their move if accord to the new bill they want to sell their product in any private organisation it on them they can sell accord to future rate or accord to present rate thats should depend on them totally every profit gain should go to them a government body should be form which can look after the private mandis trade there should be a government and 2 party understand where it should be memtioned about their future activity the body should be give complete freedom to support and help the farmer and protect their gain or interest of anyway it should be a clear transparency where state and central government should be earn by tax and other mean both in sarkari mandis or private so government have to come into 2 job thats provide safety and security and protection of farmer interest of anytype plus 2ndly to gain tax in the mandis it require few clarification and change in the law and the farmer can improve their vegetation and produce more keep worker and labourer under them
u be try to be nuetral which be good but u need to take it easy chew ur word let the content sink in it seem like a bombardment of fact and frankly i get a sense of little desperation to sound balanced because u have not mention about the reality of pathetic condition of the farmer across the country bcz of the lack of an actually implement msp or mandi system why do u think that the farmer of bihar work a daily wage labourer in punjab these bill will lead punjab haryana also to a similar fate
come at minimum support price msp how many western country you can name follow this practice probably none why because msp system be against farmer how it be an old say in economics demand raise the price only licence holder trader or govt can buy farmer produce in apmc mandi no outsider be allow to directly purchase from farmer thus leave farmer at the mercy of bunch of crook trader and govt remember govt would only buy that much which be sufficient for the population it will not buy and it should not buy everything
feel like farmer be not yet ready to make farming like an industry if i get good price elsewhere why i may not like to sell there well it be relate to quality of product if quality be bit bad i can sell in mandi msp be already there a be before if good i may sell elsewhere in high price protest be highly motivate by politics and middleman

the world be far too reliant on monofarming and large agricultural company and i think move towards more sustainable method be the right thing to do however just go back to the way thing be because everything be great in the past and big company and capitalism suck ignore the reason why farmer switch in the first place the farmer union representative say at the end of the video that the old way be good there be no debt and everyone be do great then he gloss over the fact that the famers switch to more grain be because people be starve at the beginning of the video the professor say the only benefit of monfarming be quantity quantity be important when there be hundred of million of people starve in the world and with an ever grow population that be true during the green revolution which be why it happen and be still true today these farm technique have become more sustainable and harmful over time because of corruption and shortsighted corporate greed and reform be definitely need but there be good reason why the system be introduce and on average the human have become well fed fitter large and strong a a result there be pro and con to every solution and they should all be consider instead of claim the old way to be the fix all

alot of people be not think outside the box with private player enter the market farmer will have more employment opportunity not bear the risk involve with damage crop also it be a fact that private enterprise be statistically more productive compare to government enterprise in india this invariably mean that there will be a great level of focus towards achieve high standard of productivity also private enterprise would have the ability to raise capital and make investment to implement good farm technology in india although private entity will be enter the market the government will still impose logical and reasonable regulation like how the rbi regulate large proportion on private banking function in india also it be important to know that the mandi culture be currently a mafia driven culture where the middleman and government official be in on it and if this bill come into place it would be hard for them to make their cut illegally so this be just my opinion after do a bit or research although on face value we do not see this because no one cover the positive angle to this story

india be a very complex system where the middle class enjoy cheap food price and farmer receive low price for their crop a they currently be not allow to store crop pay high price for input and do not have the ability to protect themselves with future contract the current system in india be not sufficient to support all the small farmer in india they lack the scale to produce store and market their own product a free market can only work which these bill seek to do if both buyer and seller have equal bargaining power small farmer be not only lack the skill but also the knowledge to effective participate in a free market they free they will be crush under low price the government should offer assistance and compensate for farmer harm by these law until the economy normalized india need to grow beyond have million of small farmer and the farmer need to accept their faith but i think the government do not do a good job in market these bill also the people of punjab be well off farmer compare to rest of india if you look at the number of child be send outside from punjab to study in college you would understand why punjabi be at the heart of the protest they enjoy the high income in the country from farm any threat to their lifestyle would bring about a reaction many of those protest have on name brand clothes nike adidas and drive audis these be not the lowly farmer of bihar

2 lack of crop diversity and support industry india be a surplus producer of stuff like rice and wheat we just produce too much of it while we end up import some other major crop like pulse now it be somewhat of a side effect i can say a government give msp guarantee on rice and wheat in a lot instance which make it artificially more profitable to grow than other crop even though it should have be the other way round where price on rice and wheat should have go down if supply be too high and discourage farmer to grow them and grow something where there be demand for or else it be just a waste of food money soil and effort now i do know the issue with this a farmer fear leave a stable and safe source for something where they end up make less so i feel government should introduce some sort of a float msp system where msp will be set accord to demand and supply
i come from an india where a muslim be a muslim a christian be a christian but a hindu be a secular liberal atheist

3 cut the role of middleman in sale purchase of agriculture produce so that farmer and consumer get the benefit
let me give you the counter perspective these three law be what have create the farm sector to grow slowly removal of these law would mean investment in farm infrastructure by private enterprise which will lead to more stable price for farmer as well a consumer and will enable the farm sector to grow fast farmer will have the choice to sell their crop in public or private market public market be riddle with corruption where middleman can take margin up to 80 of farmer be profit private market will allow competition from private buyer which will end the monopoly of middleman lead to good price for farmer
i do not think anyone have explain this issue with such a clarity my suggestion to you be to remake or probably dub this video in hindi as well so that more and more people could understand it

it be really funny how you change up each and every single law in order to fit your socialist agenda only show the bad light of each and every one and one more thing you do be hide graph you do not show the growth rate of gdp per caput of farmer in bihar a compare to those in punjab bihari farmer income be grow at an average 13 every since the 2006 reform punjabi farmer since the time have only see their income grow at an average 1 another thing you do not include those farmer who say that they would protest have the law be take back by the government
i think from next time onwards when i will hear farmer commit suicide i will end up laugh these fool have actually lead to their own downfall have they read the law carefully and patiently they would have understand the benefit of law but fool be fool and time and again we see that how big of fool we be good night farmer and await ur hardship in future
this model already fail in developed country like france and america then why we be take this model in develop country like india i think this law be wrong
shameless bhajpa govt totally shameless
what a pathetic attempt at justify these draconian bill
be this bjp be channel how can u sleep at night
plz read bill care fully
main thing be that farmer be not ready to hear at all so gov also should not introduce any reform for these fool there be clearly write in bill no land of farmer will be take and if farmer do not agree with corporates to sell there produce then do not sell and anyway i think in open market without trade farmer can sell at a good price and it not that farmer be not get msp they be get more msp a compare to 2014 so i think we must support farm bill
apmc have flaw new ordinance have flaw we need to understand and differentiate india from other developed country nd expect not what happen there will happen here too i do not understand how come free market create the monopoly out of three ordinance only one ordinance may b some issue but people without understand protest against all three ordinance i think dhurv will discuss all three ordinance but disappoint
the cost will definitely increase but this time it will not only be the farmer take the hit you and i a a consumer will have to bear it but be not it what we all want to have our farmer get a fair share for their labour earlier mandi be use to make profit now the corporates will but that will not come at the farmer be expense how many state farmer make a decent profit on their work only a handful what about the rest we need some new agricultural bill from a long long time and this be it
it almost 1 year but still this be the best explanation of the bill and forward to so many group the response be so optimistic towards govt just regulate the bill that be the response
well modi be vote in by a legitimate election process like george carlin say can not complain if you vote for him that be why he never vote use the democratic process and vote someone in that will help you

he will not leave these law a it reppeal because he must be obedient to donor so he make something well to donor after 5 state election
farmer must boycott nihang sikhs a they be chop innocent people
1 36 i never know farmer of lakhimpur wear turban like sikh do
just a question if something be not in favour of people then people can oppose it by protest and all yes there be violence here but the voice be hear here of farmer so be this a good thing that people be voice be hear
actually those solution be business innovative idea concepts that be use in commercial purpose to gain too much profit that be why some educate person do not train or give some advice to those farmer

no other content news or article explain the bill a this video do kudos and thank you so much
your discussion be not only illuminate but also inspire the three farm law a on today stand scrap you have endorse my hunch that the the agitation be basically engineer by rich farmer and middleman especially from punjab and haryana you miss one point that kerala essentially a socialist state never legislate apmc act hence the farmer do not have to offer their produce at designated marketplace to licensed middleman one reason could have be kerala be not into subsistence farming of paddy the other reason be must have be political which be that the entire focus of support the farmer be the farmer of punjab and haryana may be because the people who represent the farming interest at the centre be basically from these two state so the economic and political focus of green revolution be centre on these two state i would say a partisan approach to a national issue if farmer from other state be similarly engage there be no reason why they could not have rise to the occasion again there be no reason why 88 and 70 of national procurement of paddy and wheat should happen from punjab and haryana time the centre distribute it procurement more equitably among all indian state this will immensely benefit punjab and haryana a their farmer will shift focus to other crop thereby reduce the ecological burden on these state of grow rice and wheat

it be not a sad news a many people be say in comment section
this be how people have successfully manage to show something which be a benefit for the farmer a something detrimental to their growth if i sell my produce outside for a price of 15 a kilogram and msp be 3 why the hell do i need msp and all when i go into a free market obviously i will have many entity which want to buy my produce and i will not even pay tax please do not spread propaganda jai jawan jai kisan
it too vague to say that unregulated market dont work and will collapse an open market will cause demand supply to drive price which usually lead to a more viable economy also these law help farmer trade their produce all over india without go through the mandi mandis be currently mandatory for any agricultural trade for an open market to fail it would mean that all the trader across india collude to offer unfair price to the farmer that argument lack any logical reasoning
so basically you be worried about monopoly in this sector well we already have law for that if a corporation start exploit of the farmer or consumer then both will shift to another company market competition need to be maintain and that be where govt step in ask yourself why be internet in india so cheap it be because of market competition and buddy it work wonder
this law also state that purchaser do not need any license to buy produce from farmer instead any pan card holder can be in this business which lead farmer more vulnerable to frauds
the one who kill people
2 he assume that the govt will pull out of acquisition of food item and he build base on that that be a grossly incorrect assumption not only because the govt have commit not to abolish apmcs but also the govt need those produce for distribution through pd

how contract farming could be against farmer no 1 be force farmer to make contact with any compani those who trust could make aggrement and those who dont trust contract famring do not involve into it it only provide farmer with a extra choice it totally upto them weather to have a comtract or not what be there to portest in contract farming
since when do a free market become a bad thing farmer in india shy away from grow organic produce and choose to grow sub standard gmo crop because of msp since they know the quality be of no relevance any quality be support by the government promise minimum support price a free market lead to competition amongst producer well investment in product which be relevant to market demand take the example of avocado across the world sustainable profitability for producer and also good quality product at a good price for the consumer a product like rice can not be monopolize by a large corporate because if that be true then amul have already monopolize the milk industry in india be the milk producer get fair value for their product yes because if amul will not pay the local producer a fair price someone else will or the milk producer will sell directly to the customer which they do even now the farmer protest be base on fear mongering and unfortunately a small percentage of educated class be also stand in their support out of confirmation bias just because it give them an opportunity to reaffirm their hate towards a political ideology

nicely present but you forget to mention that farmer have still the option to sell to mandi it be their choice whether to enter into a private deal or market or do business as usual a for the essential commodity it be true that this amendment can encourage hoard eventual price rise inflation you do not mention the base price with ref to which those percentage will be calculate point here be if anything people at large be the one to be offend affect by the potential for price rise while farmer have the chance to make more money surprisingly public be quite calm about the law while those who be likely to be benefit be apparently agitate about the amendment it will be useful if you can explain the possible real undercurrent for their anger that make them carry protest for such a long time with a strong demand on repeal of these law in fact people need to be tell what be at stake for the various stakeholder in this play how these law when implement can contribute to growth of our economy in general by way of both high efficient agricultural produce as well a by rope in tax that be conveniently evade by middleman in the industry

a an indian the main mistake of the government be that it do not talk about the bill to the farmer of all state while frame them in tamil nadu for example they barely rely on msp so the bill do not affect them to a major scale this be not the case in punjab and harayana
these bill be death warrant for the farmer

modi have to realize that indian farmer be not kashmiris
the farm law of 2020 just aim to facilitate selling agriculture produce outside apmc be the act do not mention closure of mandis people keep on say it be a failure before even test it the law aim to remove all the barrier for free trade and inter state trade of agriculture produce but there be one drawback the poor farmer can not take their product to other state themselves or could not get msp be now instead of think how we could help farmer move their produce freely people just criticise the entire farm law the act provide legal dispute resolution mechanism if there be a disagreement between the buyer and seller the act also say about facilitate direct online buying and sell the law would have help create a wide market they could have become successful in implement it but people fail them it be not a win but a big loss for farmer

2 government need to formulate the law create the framework which ensure that farmer should be fund with the promised amount a per the contract
2 law specifically mention that the farming contract can not be link with title of the land in any way so false propoganda that farmer land will be take by corporates be not true and law prohibits such contract
this explanation create a question in mind that be it good and or bad which be more important for any bill or act
as well a farmer right

true news brother
the price limit mean nothing if the percentage increase be not base on a fix and absolute price of a food commodity 50 increase from what price exactly the food price will generally increase over time due to population growth and the subsequent lost of purchase power by monetary inflation so if the 50 price increase protection from the central government be not base on a fixed price that do not change then this bill can lead to significant price increase over time for instance this year the price increase by 40 for a food commodity in 3 month time the price again increase by another 40 from the now high price etc the government never step in to regulate the price since the 50 mark be not base on a fixed and unchanging price over time

our pm sahib have no time to meet the kisans personally then because that be what the farmer brother be ask for but now on medium platform on guru purab announce that 3 law would be repeal would not change the hatred the bjp govt gather in this past year
in the world of news we have forget to fetch righteousness in a human

you be say that mandi ke andar ek system bn gya tha rate kisan nahi middleman fix krte the to ye btao jb rule aur regulation hone me bawajood mandi ke andar kisan apna haq nhi le pa rhe to ek free market me kese le payenge corporate system me swayam bhagwan to ake baithenge nhi ki wo ane wale time me kisan ko exploit krne ka sunehra moka chor dega mandi system me to fir bhi msp mil jata jbki open market me iski suvidha tk nahi to agar rule and regulation ke bich price fix wala mahol bn skta to kya gurantee open market me esa nahi hoga
these be goon not farmer see their language they be just play in the hand of country breaker their intention be just just to blame modi govt and stop development activity
europe and u force indian government to stop give subsides to this farmer to have a fair compition why didnt you think of indian farmer then
shingo boder par kuch kisan the kya inhey bataei to
a farmer can choose if he want to sell in mandi or not it farmer choice jai kisan jai bharath
b while you farmer may be honest hardworking etc etc so be many other type of worker e g trader small business owner labourer etc why should only you be get differentiated treatment at the cost of everybody else
a research base explanation be good or as bad a the information in this case semi information that the analyst choose to work on the comment show how the clueless middle class india and even mr sengupta be buy into the corporate narrative about more choice and good price it be not that mr sengupta be bias it be just that he need to put in more effort into his assumption
this place they use a camp holiday site this be not a farmer protest this be politics
i appreciate vox medium to create video outside of their expertise but i will have to say that you understand the situation so less buy show current bunch of graph do not show the exact picture take the example of farmer income graph punjab haryana farmer be already rich because this be the two state be green revolution take place not the whole country a for bihar it farmer be very poor from begin a it be one of the backward state but from last from 2005 farming be grow in bihar with 10 15 more than national avg 2 3 infact it stale or even decline in punjab and haryana another point farmer in punjab and haryana generally and majorly grows wheat and paddy bcuz of msp in cycle in vast surplus a govt have to buy from them which be ultimately store and waste they be loose their entrepreneurship a they have now become to much comfortable with the arrangement other state have already dilute lot this in their own way which motivate them to grow a wide variety of crop beyond traditional wheat paddy cotton which indeed help the land and environment too
vir da should make a joke about this with his two india principle
sikh have always be unique fill with humility strong character in my perception and now this protest have prove them to be the hope of our country as well
good analysis nd i understand that these law be baised towards corporates
2 farmer can sell their good anywhere big farmer can benefit from it but small farmer any way do not go to mandi be but it be government way to get out of farm business and selling to private company mean face the ups and down of the market government will not intervene by give any subsidy or help for procurement
awake oh youth of india go for good understanding of farmer bill till now we support bjp with the farmer bill make a campaign to pull down bjp do not forget parent the farmer who feed you
this be actually not accurate but most news be distort by the time it reach abroad this bill will actually weaken the corrupted middleman regulate agriculture market and monopolize the agricultural trade it be also worth question why only the farmer from the punjab state of india have a problem with the bill this state have the rich farmer in india while the farmer from other state like maharashtra comit suicide every year because of poverty in no other state of india be farm a rich lucrative profession they be also be fund by group that have call for seperation of punjab khalistan from india for decade the majority of protestors be not farmer themselves but their parent and grandparent who be litterally be feed expensive food on a daily basis so they literally have no incentive to go back to work and take care of their farm and lastly these guy be refuse to talk to the government to negotiate they just want this bill to be remove there be something very fishy about these protestors
these three law be very beneficial to farmer of backward area
1 why punjab and haryana farmer seem to be protest relentlessly compare to the rest of the country be it because msp primary help with wheat and rice produce if that be the case southern state should have be equally protest
blame the punjabi farmer cartel
great ji and this good but now also not accept there step be wrong and harna kya h hr pb dl village western up but gurgaon border and rewari do not support farmer it be also write in history only for awareness no hate
people from maharashtra still not aware that this be implement in maharashtra since 2016 no news channel show this news at that time and that be why there be no protest against the bill in maharashtra
if these people have the wherewithal to differentiate between what be sensible and what be not they would not be poor farmer the fact that anyone be support these protest be a reflection of their political leaning nothing to do with the policy themselves but who implement the policy protest and die of covid that be the fate you have choose
indian agriculture sector need reform since the old law be fail to help farmer in current time a evident from the chart describe in your documentary currently the state have a monopoly over purchase farmer produce lead to rampant corruption in the system deteriorate farmer condition even more farmer can not sell their produce outside the designated mandis deny them freedom to trade while the 21st century be all about market driven economy the farmer in india be still grapple with archaic license raj system which must go now

remove middleman will only improve the condition of farmer and carry over the price saving to consumer drive down inflation throughout the industrial revolution what we have see be that get more people out of manual labor and streamline operation remove middle men have always lead to huge benefit be carry over to consumer farm be no different than other industry would we rather have product sell by middle men who have price monopoly and subjugate farmer and pocket substantial profit or would we prefer give farmer the ability to sell directly to consumer set up logistics business cold storage prevent food wastage by that rationale we should have ban car and should still be use bullock cart because car be obviously make in industry pollute the environment and be not make by small shop
thank you for support farmer
in that case farmer owner of land have to bear the cost of seed and pesticide to escape this type of situation farmer have to take farm insurance own by corporate in which the corporate would get back their investment safely seed be pesticide and farmer get their loss under the certification of sdm dm the farm insurance company own by corporate always benifted because insurance be take by only one and two or more farmer and rest farmer bear their cost in form of insurance premium
govt isnt say it be mandatory to follow any of these bill right
apmcs free market system no matter what measure you put in place a farmer will continue to be exploit as long a consumer do not understand the true value of good crop

we must develop and promote sustainable agriculture that be not in debate or at least it should not be but that be not just as simple a well plant more stuff dummy we need systematic solution that may involve some unsavory thing like mass industrialization and centralization of farm in certain area which would wipe out a lot of farmer and force them into new profession but would allow large scale adoption of farm practice hopefully good one at that that be not politically popular though anywhere
you do not know about farmer
good idea government should be obey n thing new idea for farmer

these farm bill will allow private hand to buy from farmer but a farmer doesnt have enough money to produce their crop how will farmer bear cost of take that produce to private buyer a mandis be closely locate to village but not private company and it may be possible that these private player again introduce a middleman to buy from farmer and give the produce to company on a fixed commission rate and this be also possible that these private player can also form cartel a there will be no government intervention again the same farmer will suffer another thing be why dont government make change in apmc act and let the farmer take benefit from it

about msp it not as simple a make it sound if you look at the supply chain of the produce buy at msp it mainly by purchase for pds public distribution scheme and for maintain adequate level of storage in case future threat to food security right now the msp be uncompetitive in open market mean the excess grain can not be sell a it would be way cheap to import the same lead to wastage of the stored produce hence cause huge loss to exchequer if msp be set to international price then there be no roi for the farmer for few of the grain make it difficult for ensure food security in case of war or any other calamity be to strike then import supply chain will be at risk

great video thx so the consensus i can arrive at base on this information be this farm bill be not comprehensive and lack application of thought my thought be simply this if today with all the tech and knowledge and experience we have gain we can not take care of u farmer and bring down the price on essential and non essential item it be depress and really sad i have great expectation from this govt i sincerely hope we a a nation work towards solve all the gap and redraft this to make it more comprehensive to ensure the corporates dont play with the 50 and 100 which i guarantee that any company will do far i dont see how this will stop hoarding in our country where our judicial system take forever to resolve case how much peace will it bring to the farmer most of who have not be able to get even the basic education busy feed our country to have a legal contract i dont see this a solution to the problem face today if anything it seem only make a big mess
i understand this bill but why be the farmer protest
it be seem good at paper but reality be very harsh and sour
govt shud buy the produce directly from farmer and sell it with profit to corporates everyone win
congratulation to india democracy in action
i always support farmer
u must say sorry for former for what u do how many farmer have dead against these farm law what for their family
bhaiya apne bahut acha bola i be with the farmer
yaar really rakesh daketh be like r u comedy me
govt sell 2 3 kg essential item to poor people in india for there survival so if an company take all the food and govt leave nothing to buy what will happen to those people after that u know that very well they will die because of hunger or start do crime it increase the threat only
fruit of green revolution could not reach rest of the country these law be the attempt to do it

sorry to say beta modi be a sher for india u can not do anything
educate farmer it work
india be probably the bad country in their treatment of the poor that awful caste system big change need to happen
everything be correct except it be not mandatory for farmer to deal with corporates they always have option to continue the old process
due to politics farmer and middleman only suffer
imagine if all farmer form a organization and start protesting in whole country
sir i have idea about farm bill start up and dense startup can i help u sir even textile and other sector too and i can help u
contract farm for farmer where they will be tell by corporates to grow what kind of crop corporates again happy
finally i see western medium talk about this
thank god there be just 3 3 million view on this video this be not at all neutral he barely tell about the advantage that be one side everyone should check out vikas divyakirti video on this issue on drishti ias channel it be longer and you can get crystal clear understanding of the issue even with a constitutional point of view do check it out then judge for yourself if this dhruv rathee be worth listen or not
major drawback of bill be that if a farmer didnt get his deserved price a in contract for his crop then after this bill he can not go to court to sue the contactor
finally i find a youtuber after watch his video i do not feel like i waste my time or chilling and feel like i be learn some new
great p m of bharatey history shree n d d modi je
surely farm bill need to review in farvour of indian farmer
brilliant video that cover a complicated issue with so many different factor it baffle my mind that our government dont support these sustainable farming solution globally when environmental disaster be clearly unfold around u 60 of all life on earth lose since the 1950s largely due to deforestation and pesticide mostly for beef production this be the alarm sounding loud
farmer will be exploit no matter by whomsover
i be actually supportive of the move reform can only happen if bjp remain in power and farmer be a big vote base

this pay medium and anti modi
commercialization with the advantage to the producer be good but will that be the picture no farmer will be only protect but the private company who neither produce or consumes enjoy maximum right but the consumer be not protect we have to go through this rise and fall
gand alf the saffron finally say you the bill shall not pass
talk about tomato he say macd will advance book the order with specific size of tomato farmer can not decide the size a we all know at the end they have to compromise with the price decide by macd but what he say and how he say you all will believe that this bill will be beneficial for farmer
politician get pay while farmer do not
thanks modi ji you be much good than those congressi in the 80
contract farming be an improper word use to explain the bill soon a it be pronounce it be understood that the purpose be to miss guide and so it be more of spread the propaganda than the actual knowledge contract farm would be right if the entire exercise of farming be under a contract and all service render and cost incur would be payable under the contract
we want the middle men not to loot farmer and consumer example farmer sell tomato for 3 r per kg but we consumer get it for 35 r wtf
another ridiculous thing be farmer decide what they want to grow fair enough however problem arises when a lot of farmer try to sell the same thing at the end of the season which course drive the market price down and farmer get nothing in another senario they do not produce a particular crop due to which the market price shoot up
food crop will not come under essential commodity act and can be store for long period
stupid farmer think the bill oppress them and now they be leave suffering by wholesaler
lallantop anchor look like totally out of question kuch samajh nai raha ise
super speech but not win election saheb
the bill look useful to farmer but sure it will destroy indian agriculture sector tooo the reason be so simple 60 indian farmer economically and technologically poor so they force to sell a per corporate intrest may this year corporate give little more price to get farmer support but sure next year they start the real play i m not a farmer but v want to give all support to poor farmer bcz they r the backbone of indian economy now all country middle class population increase and the poor class drcreasing but our country very sad to say current middle class declaing while the rich corporate become more powerful it s very bad sign of development jai jawan jai kisan
have the punjabi ever think of rule themselves instead be rule via declare independence
wah news channel

instead of govt the criminal must pay the compensation to suffer farmer or the criminal must be hand over to their family
why not make the farm law for the rest of the country and let the farmer of punjab and haryana do whatever they want
cm sdm ke collection possible to sale right sir
ever wonder why protest be only limited to punjab the protesting farmer grab land of small farmer during the green revolution and have constantly be benefit through subsidy
these 3 law be wrong here and now because of the way they be introduce and because of the room they create for corruption however they signal an inevitable evolution they will fail today because of how profoundly they represent the nature and will of the current administration however they will resurface in the future with a new look and a different energy simply because it be the only way forward to enable economic freedom and create competitiveness on a global scale india be farmer must collectively organize and empower themselves to take control of their own destiny and grasp the lever of free market utilization to create wealth and economic independence today they be still manipulate by opportunist and illegal collaborator who take advantage of exist policy to enrich themselves at the expense of simple mind and marginal landowner efficiency must be realize by utilize agricultural india limit natural resource to continue to fee an explode population the intermediate way forward be to give farmer the tool and the wisdom to start down a road to first realize and appreciate their latent collective power to create a free market in their own image and second to create a robust environment in which to recognize appreciate and honestly process the complexity create by the indian way of thinking and operating this be the way
bc the parent of farm family like u be prefer private job over agriculture just because of no freedom of sell and no private player in the agriculture if at all dalari interfere he will loot u but we get a hope with those bill and try to go back for agriculture but central government cheat u for khalistanis please study how agriculture be in the european country kahan se laate hon itna hypocrisy i always use to say that these three law be not the historic and need more improvement in farm law and i think it be a start in farm reform with three bill if you hate modi hate him hate bjp why be play with the life of farmer humko anna datha bolthe hain you be the bad form of modern education output
z news should raise the issue of poor unemployed

meghnad have perhaps intentionally not explain that the process of price discovery just fail in the apmc mandis because the licensed middle men collude together rather than compete against each other and quote a single price which be always equal to or very slightly more than the msp this be simply because the whole apmc system itself be stupid from the very inception and directly facilitate this
this will go down in history never have be before that without any power mai baap without violence they do it it brim my heart once again kishaan have show that they be the most disciplined and dedicated people in the world

it be so encouraging to see the poly farm solution in this video and hope we quickly take up more harmonious practice that benefit people and the rest of nature alike
the initial point about who control mandi but fair estimate around 370 political family control all apmc mandi in india yes just 370 family control food supply of 1 6th human population on the planet
never vote for bjp again just pledge it
you should read the law before any comment new farm law will give more option to the indian farmer it be very beneficial for farmer
again this be a master stroke on right time by narendra modi mindblowing
and the protest be only from few farmer from 2 state
the only way to increase the income of farmer in punjab and haryana be to encourage
shameful especially this news anchor
congress party muradabad
learn this lesson well see the unity under one cause in the tribalism that be breed with the help of those who would divide you when there come a time to take control the tribe must give up their divergent resolution and find a cause for all their strength they will respect a desire that be able to set in motion every heart what desire can unify the divided find it and make it your rally cry no farmer no food no me no you
farming be the close connection between human and nature
just a day before punjab election i wonder why
my question be why the farmer from particular state of our country have problem with bill and why not from other state much soochoo
these be not farmer
trevor you just drive a gigantic bull dozer on my trust in you road and make it bullet proof thank you for share such an important news in your own unique way

there be no question on the need for law to get rid of unscrupulous middleman between farmer and consumer how do take away mandis go to help mandis be set up to prevent exploitation of farmer in the first place how come it become breed ground for middle man
mai humesha apne doston se kehta hoon ki jo extremes dikhte hain sach kahin un dono ke beech hota hai farmer act me bhi ye sahi baat hai thank you so much sir for this informative video it bring clarity and save u from propaganda
sir a u provide solution that msp should be legal mean they get the minimum price outside and inside the mandis production of crop be much large than the requirement so not even in mandis they be provide msp be this solution will just increase the problem of farmer a not equal to msp atleast they be get something if should be legal then they will not be able to get that amount because it not possible that the whole production be purchase so atleast something be good than nothing even in this video u state that in mandis also only 6 farmer be get msp what about rest which be the majority so atleast they be get something if this be legalise they wont be able to get that if they go against the law thn everyone of u knw the outcome i also belong to punjab n i genuinely want that farmer should get whatever right for them
if the farmer want to suffer let them what else finally it be the farmer who lose
please release this in hindi a most of the farmer do not understand english
whoever the government be they must think for their welfare
when farmer get angry it mean thing be really go not well
reporter ke death dande maarne sai or uske ghar wale or kuch kah rahe the
this be absolute nonsense the three farm reform be be recommend by agri expert for decade the mandi system have fail to improve the income level of indian farmer and the govt have do maximum already private investment and new mandis be a necessity please do not give one side perspective about thing you do not understand at all
i have a point to add the claim from the farmer that he have sell his crop say for 4 dollar per kg it less than his father be but it fail to acknowledge the fact that the overall produce of the farmer per acre land have also increase people dont account for that
so either the protest be politically fuel or the farmer be misguide by those who do not like current government
proud of our kisaan but for farmer who lose their life for fight there own right
very well explain and it be not bias i think it time people should consider it for themselves if these law be in good interest or not and i hope they come to the same conclusion a me that the agitating farmer be merely not protest for themselves but for common people like u a well
who keep defend the farm law for more than a year by call
produce rice wheat vegetable etc out side of the district or county
what about petrol price ji
what deeply pain me be the fact that this decision to repel be make on heavy political encumbrance and not on the entirety of the farm law bjp make the mistake of not carry out due diligence with farmer stakeholder in the first place and be very haste with the farm law a much wise and inclusive decision should have be make on a sector like agriculture that contribute over 15 of the country be gdp and employ over 50 of the population directly and indirectly thou i totally agree with good number of the farmer grievance but personally i be in favor of the farm law and sad that it have to go away like this i feel even sadder this law have to be scrap under the political burden and not because of the law itself
i appreciate to such youth he be real son of farmer god bless him

the 2nd bill will give the farmer a chance to sell outside mandis but this do not necessarily mean that the govt will try to get out of the agriculture business you can definitely sell in mandis too you will just have both the option which be a pretty good deal for the farmer
hahaha great video this actually sound pretty good msp for security and free market for prosperity lot of farm produce get waste in india this will actually help reduce the time to sell these perishable good and reduce hoard but may also lead to large scale industrial farming and totally push the poor farmer off the equation it be high time people leave all the farming to automate machine easier say than do though

1 use new storage technology
msp discussion be must in bill it should be amend
the goverment should not roll back the farmer ordinance some change should be make but completely reject the ordinance be not the solution
stocking of essential commodity should be relate to market price in the bill so that market price largely remain the same with little fluctuation otherwise corporates will start maneauvering price in their favour
3 the root of tree can not grow well if we fee it and restriction will give them opportunity to empower
r u read the comment or only for money you be create video you be present this in a wrong way please read comment

hy vox i have always like your content like this one howsoever you have take the current farmer pain correctly but miss out and even portray the gov a bit draconican towards farmer perspective of gov here be also correct for national development if you check the history msp it be introduce a a policy to incentivise farmer to take up the green revolution and from there a great gentry orignally farmer in 13th century england enter political space and control agri market thereby make wheat and rice the most needed crop at the time a they be staple in india the major crop procurred under msp due to the political inheritance the policy do not change and rice and wheat production shoot rice a thirsty crop have be grow unchecked in state like punjab and haryana due to the unchecked protection provide through msp and the farmer politician result in water level go to new low every year punjab and haryana rank in the relative lowest category acc to rainfall index in india so a thirsty crop in a water dry state the problem intensify a gov also provide electricity subsisdies which leave farmer with no check to keep their water pump run introduce these bill the gov intention be to harmonize agriculture produce accord to market demand by open deregulate market which operate on the economics of supply demand this will not only push farmer to diversify crop production by make a shift to more sustainable more profitable crop numerous agri startup provide end to end service be on a high rise in india to provide aid but also aid government to reduce the buffer wheat and rice rott in capacity of 100 be of ton each year due to unavailability of efficient store space and gutt load of produce yes the system leave space for exploitation of farmer by big corporation but the current gov be not anti farmer a be shout thats just stem out of the pain that will be cause due to change but vox england become an industrial economy due to creative destruction a do any other rich economy correct bill and law should be pass and not protest look at the long term gain and not the short term pain i be not a bjp supporter i myself think i be sound like one when i re read what i have write but yes an enthusiast in know whats go around
our farmer live in very poor condition der crop sell at cent to middle man broker this law mean to give financial stability to every single farmer in that protest 100 of police of injured those police be do not even lathi charge nor dey do violent protest trevor plz do ur home work properly
thumbnail picture be wrong what do you want to portray bbc
4 i think we be also underestimate the intelligence of farmer even they can form a cartel in many develop city many farmer become builder and exploit the buyer or another example could be they hoard onion during election season
look at sri lanka they adopt organic farming look at the food scarcity they be have now
it should be consumer protest not a farmer protest
who be responsible for such delayed decision and people who lose their life during this period need to be give justice this be matter of human dignity
what if the government be not able to manage the crop purchase at msp what if they do not have enough storage or efficient supply chain there be a lot of news that crop destroy in godown in lack of adequate care and shelter govt may not be able to handle the surplus then why force the government to purchase at msp that be what the farmer be do
godi medium have all plan to crush this farmer revolution
up and punjab election be come hahaha dont fool indian and farmer
some time government have to bow for heavy pressure cause by public opinion so happens even in western democracy remain to see which side be right farmer or the government

to me only educate farmer with small business niche development and sincere assistance provide through smb ministry be the only way how do you educate these farmer maybe some cash in hand will help for starter like if they could be give money like cab driver get from these company but it a strong maybe
agriculture be a state subject state can repeal mandis like many state in india have do if they want why must center bother about it center be never force to buy crop from farmer of punjab for their reserve they can divert this fund to the farmer of west south and central india
also the third bill say about hoard isse ab trader price km rhne pr bht hoard krenge or market force ko control krenge to iska asar kispe dikhega hmare farmer pr
narendra modi have already embark upon divert punjab water to other state he want to hit sikh hard than indra gandhi

what happen to covid concern during all the election rally in bihar bengal and now go on in full scale in tamil nadu for municipal election
at least to strike a compromise govt need to have a seperate agency to act a a business resource center for the farmer in each state that they can go to to give them business guidance teach them business negotiate skill etc
note that this be 4 month old 1 now govt have agree for msp 2 u also say apmc will continue if so farmer have the option to go to apmc to avoid exploitation by corporates n to get msp 3 be it correct to assume buyer a adani ambani alone a wrong mindset push on there be umpteen smes pan india who can very well be the needy buyer small farmer also can form self help group model use mechanisation to minimise cost take help of a youngster for on line contact etc to have good bargaining with smes groupa can be capable to fight against exploitation of big corporates 4 ultimate aim be to narrow the gap between farmer price and consumer pri ce which be several multiple without any value addition govt can bring some other employment scheme for middleman which can supplement the gdp the inflation can also be reduce by f to c so win win for all 5 it be wrong to picturise the word corporates a negative any indian can avoid all corporate product present day it be not the top 2 3 alone enterprising smes can grow in certain space gradually put a stop to grow concentration in the hand of few 6 under contract farming can allay the system of glut in the market by suitably advise to switch produce which will avoid the risk of low price

3 after some time when mandies be dissolve then if the company deny to take the produce what happen to the farmer
bjp should again design the bill with farmer advice there concern be genuine it shameful for u that we be have our lunch and anndata be on road shameful every community either student community or service community all should come together to raise the voice and let this bill be reform
but those farmer be protest against this act because there be also no provision of msp
here where i live dairy farmer be basically leave without regulation but instead of help this cause one big multinational corporation to have a virtual monopoly over the milk market
govt should acknowledge it mistake and the death of farmer more than 700 martyred farmer family should be compensate
2 accord to farmer produce trade and commerce bill aka bill 3 private institute be allow to hoard and store farm produce even if market price increase goverment can not do anything until 100 increase per year and only after that government can intervene to release the stored product this limit apply per year so for ex if this year rice be rs 20 per kg it will be allow to go upto 30 r per kg before govetment step in and next year it will be rs 60 per kg before government step in

if we respect the government it do not mean we be afraid the cause list on different decision by the government be manipulate and even manufacture and we must reject such behaviour of the government
this bill should be revert completely a this voting be completely baseless no bill should be pass like this where he be not even verify the vote and just read the script to finally pass the bill

truth be 99 9 farmer be with modi govt truth be that most of the so called farmer be middleman or rich farmer of punjab a small state of india rule by the stupid congress party truth be leave congress have lose platform in indian politics find reason to create anarchism the idea of these farm law be conceptualise during congress rule this be discuss for close to two decade in parliament almost every opposition leader support it in parliament but they be hypocrite since 1947 thousand of poor farmer commit suicide a old mandi system middle men use to exploit these poor farmer
the current farmer protest be be instigate and sponsor by vested interest who fear that their monopoly will end once alternative marketing channel open up for farmer they be least bother about farmer be welfare and be only concern about their own revenue an example be the state government of punjab which stand to lose about 13 of revenue if agri business switch to alternative platform from current mandis this be because punjab state government currently earn around 13 of it be revenue from the fee it impose on mandis hence so many farmer from punjab have be brainwash and be be sponsor to go and protest in delhi

wo toh terrorist the na kisaan kese ho gye ab
the rationale give in your video be wrong firstly a farmer from punjab can sell his produce in haryana so nothing change today farmer from up come to haryana to sell their produce just for good rate secondly you mention that farmer currently store their produce this be wrong too farmer in reality do not have storage facility to store their produce once the produce be harvest they sell it in the mandis or to the wholesaler it be the wholesaler who can hoard the produce but by law you can not hoard the produce unless it be food corporation of india on the contrary adani have make silo which will help them in store once you store the produce and no government regulation stop you you can control the price through supply you mention the mandis be a cartel this be wrong too mandis be establish only for the purpose that farmer can go and sell their produce at a minimum support price or high mandis be just the facilitator not a middleman if mandis be a cartel then they would be purchase the produce from the farmer below the msp just like the middle men in the 1950s use to do it that be why farmer from some part of up where there be no mandis come to haryana to sell their produce in mandis i think you need to look at both the side especially how these bill will help the corporate than the farmer
pressure on easy language of contract keep farmer right monitor protection of plant variety and farmer right act 2001 in mind

this be one of the best description and summarise exactly my viewpoint thanks for a great video in a nutshell these bill be go to hurt the pocket of consumer and farmer alike it feel to me consumer will loose more than farmer this will increase blackmarketing hoard and exploitation by big corporation will increase on both side to increase their profit slowly will kill the mandis make the federal system weaker not a great outlook for bill and certainly not in favour of them a a consumer this will increase price a in the western world western world can handle it due to the social security be pay to people but indian consumer will not be able to handle it it a scary scenario unfortunately

very well explain but flaw of new bill you do not even touch them and what new bill be go to change and in depth for what purpose the bill for you be not explain
a big corp will only buy form a big farmer that be simple economics the small farmer will continue to sell to apmc market and still continue to get squeeze by these middleman once the big farmer use tradingbplatofrms can begin to sell directly globally this will in turn increase there profit margin and may in turn increase collaboration between the small farmer and the big farmer big farmer will then say do not sell to mandi but sell to u which inturn will force mandi to give a good price and less exploitation by intermediary the act simply empower more alternative to market large area of geographic distribution and removal of state barrier the only loser be certain state govt like punjab and haryanan lose their high receipt to agriculture and the middleman who hold a monopoly for so long what be further need be education to small farmer of their right many who do not even know about msp and be at the mercy of the mandis
bjp literally have shoot themselves in the foot by pass this bill if they give in to the protester older problem such a caa kashmir will need to be address

what i understood be that more than farmer each and every common man should support this protest

government can not sustain support 600 million people fail socialism of the 50 90 have bring the farmer to this situation everyone agree that we need change but what would the change be be the question modis answer be privatization
i m surprise that farmer be protest for give them freedom in sell their produce
o god please give energy to farmer for every success
it be actually sad that people will still blame the farmer for protest rather than the government for introduce idea which be not viable in the long run
what vox seem to conveniently ignore be why only punjab n haryana farmer be against these law n who make these joker judge to decide what law be anti farmer
if the farmer can utilise the good factor properly it be v fine but my question be why the govt get it pass without have proper session of thorough discussion in parliament
zee news india be best news channele
this will reduce the farmer cost for input and help clean the air
but sorry to say cheat it be not the mistake of agent it be the lack of unity in between farmer offcourse illetrate and the failure of society

love this channel but the research on this one be very superficial fuel by less than half the fact to make a dramatic narration it be a story present from india and because we understand the ground reality unwillingly it be lead me to question whether all that we hear on this channel about other country could be one side un research opinion
fake news anchor youtubers ab underground hone ka time aagya hai

if the government be force farmer into their field them they could have do it long time ago they have cut electricity and water after the rally turn violent and few police offer get kill and few get hurt badly and i hope everyone know complete info about the law but not just outlayer of the protest they both r so different and after watch this video plz go through real info and law so that u understand this video give no complete info of what happen
in a 16 minute video you quickly say within a second that the state govt will suffer wow really unbiased

thefarmeris the only man in our economy who buy everything at retail sell everything at wholesale and pay the freight both way

the protesting farmer form the select state have much to lose from these law but parallel to this it benifits many farmer from the other south indian state who be abuse by the agent at mandi who buy at cheap rate stock the produce and regulate the flow to earn big profit this be a much need bill although it might require some more research it can benifit the country a a whole

farm law be the future and a necessity
i guess not because the farm bill be only a choice provide to the farmer to either sell to the apmc or any private player preamble of the bill here the farmer be make king n not the blood suck middleman
this be not farmer agitation it be agitation just to flare ego of handful of politically selfish people farmer will realize their loss soon

very well explain and i hope the farmer learn about their right to get maximum benefit from these bill
50 of population with 85 gdp subsidy 15 gdp produce other 50 of population of india this do not seem fair to the them most farmer get free electricity no income tax on farm subsidize food and some time even debt forgiveness still these people dont feel it be enough and think government be some money plant in fact they work only 4 to 5 hour a day and most of the work will be do by the labourer the fact be they be lazy and want more
atlast he take off his beard and talk sense
this incident surely change our perception of farmer a helpless and ignorant lot
vikasgi aapki ye catch very important but government sport faiyer policy laye
i love modi ji equal to my parent we want to tamilnadu god always with him one and only honest pm in india iron man of india our pm i love very much our pm
gooooooooo the farmer be it time to stand for your right untill you take it back
childrens be reluctant to take bitter pill but ultimately it cure them of disease similarly naive farmer seem to be misguide to take the pill of reform look they would continue to live in poverty and mercy of middle man
now they would force protest farmer to go back home and if they continue to stay until new law like mandatory msp be not approve then they make a scene that these farmer be against modi or what not to make his image a a good person
why do not you speak slowly atleast a little background music be distraction communication of this sort too fast be not comprehensible bhai ittne cut kyu ek jagha bhaitke araam se samjhaaoo yaar facts bahut hai samajhna chahataa hu parr background music aur aapke bolne ke speed ke wajah se samajhna mushkil ho raha hai ek baar vid dekhkar samajh nahi aaya
change for good be so hard to implement in india because of mislead politician of opposition party shame on indian opposition party i be a proud farmer shame on opposition and shame on idiot who supportive of stop these reform
be watch this on the day farm bill be take back
they complaint about current condition of farmer and do not want reform what be this hypocrisy
this be really well do this be the first medium source i have see out of many that truly explain the bill and instead do not talk about the politics behind them and the protest
you make my day a most of it be true i be with farmer be
not a single word on actual provision of the law speak by protestors just go to show how foolish and uninformed they be total drama
and still right now there be 5 9 k
punjab n haryana top state in farm than other state that why they protest
watch this after repeal of the farm law laugh my as off
2 i m unable to understand the irreversibility which you talk about if ola uber start exploit both customer and cab driver then why be not cab driver leave ola uber and run cab on their own wo not customer also stop use these apps and look for cab available at the location since it would cost them less similarly if one company start exploit farmer there will arise another company that benefit them i know habit be difficult to change but when difficulty arise i believe they can change
kissan be correct mansad me pass ho
it realy bed for low farmer
farmer be give option to get into contract with corporates or they can use the old option of mandis nobody take away anything from them
okay i get that but i do not get that why farmer sell this to company and not directly to consumer i mean yeah it be not that easy a i be say but small farmer who do not use apmc earlier too can make profit by sell at any price between limit and i want to know if there be nothing profitable for small farmer with old law a they be sell outside apmc then why they be support it because i search on google and it say around 80 85 farmer all over india sell outside apmc that mean the thing be nt that effective
actually they should ask for mrp which they idiot be not ask mimimim retail price
i have a question if msp be still regulate in apmcs then why do not the farmer just sell their produce to the govt whenever they be unsatisfied with the corporate offer in other word be the protest about ensure regulation in the entire market ex by add msp an issue of communism v capitalism here
thankyou for address farmer a farmer

just like what happen with potato farmer in idaho
and those anchor debators who be defend the farmer bill have no face now faceless fellow
jo student actor comedian nhi kar paye woh humare kissan karenge
these farmer be surprisingly very educate and speak very sensibly
modi will soon pay for all his sin
good decision by our respected pm god bless him with long and healthy life
farmer all over the developing world be give a serious raw deal but thats how a free market economy sadly work
q1 when contract farming be already in practice why introduce it through a bill let a state decide whether it be require or not
at first i think the indian guy with squatted truck be in india and be like this have go too far now
farmer be not educate enough to deal with high
but why farmer be protest in punjab if it be only the problem of state government be the farmer then want to help govt sacrifice their interest
indian police force have handle these protest with utmost restraint it may be note that hundred of men and woman serve in the police have be physically attack and in some case stab and seriously wound
almost all farmer support against these law farmer from 1 acre to 100 acre owner all take stand and win
6 20 still farmer get msp but after this bill they wont even get that
this law of implement properly with strong measure to protect the interest of farmer will improve their income
farmer of india
it hard to believe bjp accepted defeat so easily they be know to take very calculated step and decicion and they have enact much more controversial act than the farm law before it hard to figure out what they be plan next may be punjab election or they may ask the bjp rule state to enact the 3 farm bill seperately
govt farmer leader who also want msp in old video i have see
guy this be the time for modi to think about the integrity of india the farmer matter be now the news in the usa
it be not at all controversial he will bounce back with great law
it so sad plenty of farmer get kill and suffers may god bless them

this agitationist group of farmer have minority destroy entire farmer future great success achieve after 140 day of highway agitation by tikai company he may continue for the continued supply of comfortable life in ac tent
you say it be only good in theory have you try it practically i m not the bhakt but still this question come in my head so i ask
third if u will closely study the bill propose by govt it be actually a good sign for farmer i mean real farmer for thier sustainable farming
if gov first implement m s swaminathan report be recommendation then these act will surely serve the agriculture sector
ok if government try to bring directly private sector industry in farm by these 3 law fail which eventually lead to monopoly of apmc and poor farmer will be poor
wheat grain be buy very cheap from the farmer and after only grind the flour be sell at ten time the initial price
how humble the sikh brother be the sikh brother be feed samdish like his own son

i hate it when western news outlet divide india into right and leave wing yet another example of siloed behavior of the west how can they be so narrow mind cant they see country be different and they be not split the same way a the u also why didnt they cover the lok pal protest the 10 serial blast in 2008 or the same farmer protest when the same change be bring in other state of india in the last 2 decade while i be no big supporter of either party in india pls dont call me swinger another american thing i would really like if the news cover the exact policy and the ask of the farmer
vice such a propaganda machine for left liberal vice open ur eye only opposition state farmer be protest why only people of punjab be protest what about reat of india
as far a i remember even the government be try to create internet service which will enable the farmer to sell their produce to any buyer across the nation and to make it easy for any individual to buy directly from the farmer such democratisation of the farmer be market will eliminate the requirement of the msps which be inherently limit in accuracy and control the formation of monopoly and cartel
gandhi family servent bhindawala pehle gandhi family servent tha
i do not know who this guy be whether he be chamcha or sanghi or leftist or liberal
such legislation wouldnt be bad per se but when you still have such a big part of the population in farm it make little sense once other industry take off and more job opportunity be create else where the privatisation of farming be important to fill the void leave behind by few small scale farmer
indian farmer stag the big protest in world history in order to force the government to take back reform that would have end an important subsidy this pretense itself be wrong the msp be not gon na go away the new rule allow more freedom protest happen mainly in 2 state whose paddy have fail to clear the european food safety standard and it get support from overseas sikh organization
election be due in punjab uttar pradesh etc this be the main reason

all major opposition party have have this in their manifesto but now bjp be really do something good this opportunist be oppose it

if you define the mininum and max price thereby limit the margin base on whim of law maker corporation will stay away and nothing will change policy can never be perfect and future proof it need to evolve base on situation

correction the apmc in different state be regulate by the respective sarkar of that particular state one of the major concern of the farmer be the fear of lose land to the big giant which be not discuss in the video which in turn be just fear with no ground since the contract farming a told in the bill and in this video will only be do on the produce and it must not include binding of any kind on the land of the farmer i completely agree that these reform seem to be a bit theoretical revolution but the need of the hour be to plug the loophole which be give the farmer genuine concern not force the complete withdrawal of these bill i would not like to talk about how the bill be pass tho
funny police man argue all illogical farmer be talk truth and sense police will have to surrender this dictate
the info isnt complete the government doesnt buy all crop at msp only wheat and rice be buy at msp other cereal pulse and oil seed arent purchase by the government and the msp be only the suggested price this be an important point you have miss only 6 of farmer in india avail the msp to sell their produce to the government
modi and yogi and taliban have only one difference that be religion remain they all be share a common goal

i recommend you also watch john oliver be video on chicken farm to understand just why this may be bad

because of these law big farmer will not be benefit who have lot of land and equipment like tractor these bill be in favour of poor farmer
titus 2 23 while we wait for the bless hope the appearing of the glory of our great god and saviour jesus christ

at current rate for about 90 000 tractor the estimate cost for just one day be beyond 40 cr who be fund this farmer seem poor
reformer modi what a joke
farmer be own the country and business flourish a the corrupt take the money and enjoy in the city
punjab farmer do not like modi so they do not like 3 bill as well they have negative thinking why not others state farmer protest because they have trust on modi
right to protest be over now right of law abide citizen of india start enough be enough let others to live antinationalists
brother if i understand that line where company buy apple for 72rs per kg and sell 250 300 r let me analysis this for you market to storage transportation for ton of apple cost something which devide per kg them cost of storage and process cost something which also include in per kg rate then distribution to other warehouse in pan india cost something in transportation and material movement again then small storage cost something billing and retailing process cost something add and whatever you say adani or so callled company profit around 175 225 which be not so correct can you please explain public how and apple cost rise of company sell it and decrease when farmer sell it and also for your knowledge company pay for work so in directly it be go in middle class person be pocket who work on company so if goverment do not support privet sector where middle class will earn

brave sikh will take their ri8s for sure
quite informative show both the aspect of the law we indian must come together to resolve the poverty hunger and suicide by farmer use good agriculture management
you can not make msp legal if you do then middle class will be harrass by farmer and retailer because when government say in first bill that you can sell your good outside apmc and in other state then they have to charge for transportation and it very much depend on inflation supply and purchase power and oil price you cant make msp legal because those all factor play very much important role to keep the price low or high so if you be produce good and maharashtra and you want to sell that in delhi then transportation price sill play important role and price will e increase also when farmer be do contract farm they be basically make contract of good which they produce not a land
we want this type of long duration video please keep this consistent because we want to hear more and more from you more value and more execution which will also lead to a good and good india
farm protest leader be politically motivate by opposition party and just want to make chaos in country and have nothing to do with welfare of farmer or people of country
in india when you lose the support of the farmer you can expect a new government
why our govt be do this to our farmer
farmer and government

farmer be actually ill inform on these law we educted indian who see these video be also ill inform we should try to understand the law first these law be actually very good for farmer all across the country for example it be mention there be no limit for stock the produce but this thing be only for horticulture produce it be mention that all the price of the trade will be electronic which be good for every people should come out of thier old thinking and should understand the law well
really good work godi medium never show this kind of reality
today the consumer class be silent apart from punjab and haryana big and small consumer in other state be also support modi because they still have religion and nationalism in their mouth
there be a lot of drawback in the current form market where the middleman get bulk of the profit it be very essential to weed them out and create a market where farmer can directly bargain with the buyer
even here he have bring in religion before announce defeat he be still adamant to reiterate that what he do be for national good knowing fully that his effort be basicaly for the benifit of wealthy friend
the law be for farmer benefit however the protest be high jack by outside country who want to bring instability in india once revoke there plan to create instability fail narendra modi be the best intelligent and beloved prime minister of our country he know nation matter mostjai hind
warehousing be not a risk it be what provide efficiency to the market this whole idea be a socialist fantasy which assume that there be one entity in the market pvt company and market itself be devoid of competition hoarding do not occur beyond the point it be game theory stable

well explain i be an agri business and agri economics student it help me a lot
i dont see any problem with this bill maybe little bit somewhere but i dont see it
shame on opposition and taketh kill farmer for poltical gain shame shame
2 it be a fact that around 14 of farmer be able to sell produce at msp this mean 86 of farmer be not protect by msp do the farmer protest make any difference
and it will decrease to 800 100kg
another master stroke of modi
go with organic just get use to mass starvation at least it will solve the population problem you just do not have enough people in the industry enough good land to support 8 billion people via organic farm
govt have not ban apmc anyways
it be a good and practical explanation and you have bring good rationality to your thought so a not to be at both extreme but rather discused from it implecations and possible outcome you do however miss some of the main point of these bill
more over why can not govt add msp to these bill they will not because corporate company will not accept that if so they will not get them at low price to sell at high price
farmer have more public facility a compare to indian govt for public
and in new rule why we can not complain in court but either if there be dispute in payment we can only go to sdm and dc who only can set a committee of member of political party in power and opposition to resolve issue and we do not trust any politician but trust constitution
india stand with bjp not with middleman whole nation be behind narendra modi
a usual no discussion with minister no committee no consultation with expert no meeting with farmer just come on tv and announce it
guruchan da do not know anything about agriculture farming

proud to be sardar
give some ensurance to farmer before any so called reform corporate sector be not the solution of indian farm govt can not escape from it responsibility
honestly i do support indian farm worker due to the issue in which they be face be similar to what happen in mexico in 1994 in when the corrupt president of the pri get elect he propose privatization in which his administration cut down on subsidy on small farm worker collect up small plot of land and sell them to private corporation and help corporation take control of farmland this type of policy be disastrous in mexico due to food price rise dramatically inflation become extremely high the farm worker produce and be struggle a lot more and a lot more mexican farm worker flee to the u i hope indian farm worker get these type of law remove due to privatization be bad and important sector like farm should be keep by the people not by corporation
the real answer be that small farmer should be unite in several fpo be farmer producer organization which will help them to increase their bargaining power and eventually lead to prosperity

normally i dont like to respond on youtube but i will make you an exception while explain the bill you have make some assumption that the small farmer sell out of the mandis while the big farmer sell in mandi be i think the real situation be the opposite the big farmer have contact and have the know how of the market most importantly he have the money so if the item be not perishable like vegetable or fruit then he have sit on it and store it and wait for the appropriate time when the price rise and then take it out for sell on the other hand the small farmer be in dire need to money that be why they have to go to mandi where on the middle exploit them the other thing be why be it that you always try to bring the big corporation have you see the song padara padara from mahesh babu movie in that song he bring the city folk to the village and that be what be the need of the hour we need to know our village well instead of the big corporation why not have small cooperative set up both by the ordinary people and the farmer where on the farmer will sell their product and the ordinary people cooperative can buy off these farmer cooperative for the right price you have talk about the msp well the government be job be to give such msp a to have balance of both the trouble be with the hoarder who the government be compel with these law and i think that the real problem be there big farmer and middle man want that and that be why i think they have nothing but instigate the ordinary farmer in these protest plus political party
these law be anticonstitutional because farm and farm produce sale and marketing be a state list subject thus it be imperative that you highlight that it be an illegal law

a simple solution to solve the problem for grain storage would be that farmer can form their own regional cooperative like amul it will reduce the financial burden on the government and at the same time empower the farmer the concept of msp on all crop be not feasible it will increase the fiscal burden on the government

there be another loophole with msp my thought plz enlighten if otherwise msp be to encourage farmer to grow specific crop that otherwise be not so lucrative if msp be enforce will it not stop the farmer to try new crop and be in the loop of ensured msp crop we be importer of wheat and paddy and now we be grow them in excess probably it be high time to give msp on pulse and oil seed instead or similar crop which come under basic need and be import
you do not mention about minimum support price that give protection to the farmer and the help extend by the government in case private player try to cheat

nobody can suppress the framer
samadish thank you for this brilliant transparent coverage of the protest we support our farmer brother and hope this protest will knock some sense into the moronic bjp government
government have to translate these bill into all language and distribution among the farmer so they can understand also government should explain it directly to the farmer so that the farmer should have knowledge about it
p to those who think that law be disastrous for farmer ask ur self why no one appeal against the law in supreme court
3 the contract term on quality payment term quantity selection of input seed etc load everything against the farmer on top the farmer do not have access to realistic credit line and other financial tool to run farm effectively which force them into take loan with land a collateral a big fear and reality that haunt all of agriculture
in solidarity with our farmer

u have not cover many important point like that of farmer not allow to reach civil court and many others point be miss
dairy horticulture animal husbandry be not under msp and apmcs we do not have any problem with that why should it be different when it come to grain

if it be good new agriculture system in india than why the indian farmer angry modi govt
i agree with all the point you say but there be some factual error like when you point out during the 2nd bill that farmer hoard the produce in their storage unit warehouse it be wrong a more than 70 of the farmer in india be small and marginal in nature have less than 2hactres of land they do not even have a storage unit the hoarding be always do by the middleman and the second point be you do not even mention that what be the actual demand of the farmer which be repeal of all the three law no matter what they be not ask to amend the loophole you mention they just want that all the law should be scrap which be wrong overall the video be very informative and the explanation be perfect with all the example you mention thank you so much for your explanation
police must join with farmer your brother

to summarise nobody be concern with problem of farmer everybody want to gain some brownie point solution of the problem must be focus rather than a new set of law which create another set of problem for the farmer basic question be how can we make the farmer decide at what rate he need to sell his crop produce without any law binding him he get fair price at the same time middle men need to be eliminate state where there be no apmc mandi there be also more apmc must be create for small farmer contract farming be for big or large land holding from where corporates may purchase the produce in nut shell the law do not address the concern for all section state solution will be to enable both system apmc with msp or private dealer at farmer doorstep
even i can think of exploit farmer with these law

the real solution to the issue be to facilitate the mandis to flourish in order to do that msp have to be kept farmer market where atleast 50 of shelf space have to be keep aside for farmer produce with a suggested retail price this would protect the farmer msp mandis since mandis would be need to supply the farmer market and they be sole supplier for the farmer be produce end customer who know if there have be hoard go on since suggest retail price would be breach and can complain and keep the competition in place since the pvt player too could sell through the remain half of the farmer be market shelf space their own outlet farmer should be allow to sell to any mandis and this way one county one market be maintain and as long a mandis exist state govts can get their tax revenue this way everyone win

i have a suggestion to this 3 bill government should implement minimum support price for all item produce for all india basis so that the farmer will not feel exploitation anymore
we all be rely on the market for most of our daily need if one can grow why can not they take it to the market to sell it that too when they be unemployed for almost half of the year small self help group can create business around their production but you know what they be behave like a child who do not want to be get stoped feed on his her mom be milk because they have now become habitual of it but you see some day you need to grow government cant make everyone happy those protestors doo put their view with utmost violence but those who remain calm no body ask them about their view total bulshit go on not defend government because they also be no saint
or they may not be farmer at all
bro please make the conclusion of these 3 bill for my ppt presentation
we still buy our perishable food from farmer be market ever since the farmer protest start the topic of price farmer get come into light and i realise how easy we have it we haggle for price of tomato and garlic 15 r isnt enough sell it to u for 10 we ask them but the same kisan who also grow wheat sell it for 40 and we then buy it for 80 from a company who only package it and we dont even try to haggle
once again wonderful nl reporting
i think it be always good to support what be right today tomorrow they may take out msp it be just overthinking when they do that kind of thing then opposition be demand why to make a fuss now and i think we need capitalism in agriculture of course control capitalism this can definitely push even more urban people towards agriculture i see nothing bad today if anything bad happen tomorrow we will stand with the farmer no need bash everything that the government do i m a liberal too but i should not bash good reform

if you be call indira gandhi a dictator then what be modi
before say anything about farmer protest please read the farmer bill then tell about it
sir every farmer should knowledge
government of india should control all the agriculture purchase and then government should sell those produced crop private company with license of agriculture government of india should purchase crop at fixed price and give and info to all people
just my opinion legalize msps may distort demand supply curve we be surplus in few crop from domestic consumption pt of view as well a there be no export demand at the price we produce and coz of tradition farmer do not want to change the cultivation pattern a free market price incentivizes farmer for this change whereas msp will inhibit them
chahe kuch ho jaye chahe koi tabahi ho jaye but do not ever expect ki bjp ka koi leader resign kre khood se
the fact be all correct 25 million be the total no of protestors around the world

the choosy or double standard type behaviour of opposition during nda govt be beyound our understanding when election of deputy chairman happen in 2017 just have a look the order and peace they have maintain and the proper division be carry out if they would have maintain order like that with all of their member present by issue whip they may have achieve their target of send it to select committe easily there seem no need for such shouting and protest when the resolution propose by them be be take into consideration

if you claim that early there be some rule which prevent farmer from sell outside apmc you should quote in your video some instance of previous year where the govt have take legal action like arrest penalty or seizure against farmer for violation of apmc rule
it would be in the benefit of farmer if they sell their land to someone if farming be so unsustainable for them it be like if worker in a factory want to open a factory even if he have to take loan for them
when be the new video of the farmer be protest come
one correction here government can not get out of the agri business they be bind to buy wheat and rice a per the food security act it be mandatory for them to provide wheat and rice to nearly 80 cr people in india via tpds
for eg few month back soyabean price be half the price today which be now 9 to 10 k when farmer sell their all stock with half price and now shoot up to 10 k what the benefit we r get

i have support the farm law though i think some ammendments could be do but not repeal at all i think this be the lesson for government because for sensitive issue like agriculture where 60 of people depend the reform should be bottom up not top down approach the way the bill be pass in rajya sabha have create a perception of distrust among some farmer from the very start every state have a different agriculture pattern base on it economy and geography so one size fit all approach have make the discontent far more the main problem be that now atleast for next 10 15 year no reform can take place in agri sector
