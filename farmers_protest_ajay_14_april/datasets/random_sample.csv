We want more videos of this farmer protest,
Best explanation so far. Thanks a lot. MSP should be legal mandate. I support 100%. Some additional points. Farmers need to educated and united on large scale. Then it will require minimum interference from government and law to stop exploitation. Same can be said in case of ola uber taxi drivers.,
Suggestion: Govt. Of India should repeal these laws for now.. And sit with all farmers who are supporting as well as in against and discuss all issue and then make new laws which is accepted by all so that all farmers get benefitted and they really get the real value of their produce.. Thanks,
Got goosebumps after watching this.. proud of you farmers,
"This is a well made video and explained a lot. But one thing I don't understand is, why are the protests from farmers in Punjab and Haryana, but not from other states?

The problem will arise after few years when big cooperation will again form a monopoly. Government should take steps to prevent this and this is the reason why protests are happening because farmers know what will happen in few years time,

 MSP     ..   AGAIN.. ABOUT THE BILL,
Mam you explained very well but u dont have proper knowledge you stated that bihar dont have msp and mandi and you know bihar farmer selling their rice crop for 800rs and but other states who follow msp their farmers sell their rice crop for 1800. Now you tell me how this bills benifits farmers. ,
There is dictatorship in india. There is no democracy.Everyone is against these bills still these bills are passed in lok and rajya sabha . PM is dictator. I m from punjab we all are protesting against these bills . I think Modi is not able to run the country.,
Those who think corporate monopoly will take over... You are wrong. Mandi itself is a big monopoly destroying Indian agriculture.,
"This is not complete information, you addressed only some facts which are showing this bill is not anti farmer. But it's not reality.",
We hope farmers will be able to win money correctly because we need them,

Its a victory not only of farmers but Indian democracy as a whole. Jai Kisan.,
This protest is only to glorify Khalistan and nothing else. Why only Punjab and Punjabis have the problem? Other states farmers are good with the bills and for this they also started support by doing tractor rallies in UP.,
Even today Gandhi ji non violence won in the form of farmers,
"Thanks for making it easy to understand. Not just Kisaan everybody should worry about these bills. Actually, farmers are fighting with Modi govt for everyone in the country other than ambani adwani",
Farmers are protesting  but unfortunately bjp has clear majority in parliament and they will pass this bill too. Only supreme court's interference can protect farmers.,

Very nice explained.  The bill is not good for farmers,
"Thanks SIT for your update. The terrorist who killed innocent farmers at Lakhimpur using vehicles as weapon must be harshly punished. Supreme court must make sure the case is not diluted. Jay Hind, Bharat Mata ki jay... Jay Jawan, Jay Kisan",
The farm bill is feeding the corporates. This is a road towards the privatisation of farming .,
3. There is need of more options for farmers than only depend on APMC.,
So does that mean the farmer's protest is right?,
"After watching this video, I realized that there are many loop holes in ours previous Mandi and also in these 3 bills.",
So conclusion is that there should be a heavy debate in both house before passing any law so we can get a soln which ultimately helpful to farmer .,

3) There is a need to move away from the paddy-wheat-sugarcane cycle. Punjab and Haryana have played a major role in India's food security.

1st law will expose farmers to corporate who have more bargaining power.,
But then large farmer can then sell through apmc when private players provide less price of the produce,
The msp thing was a problem but the government told they will give written guarantee of the msp to the farmers and it won't be removed.,
"Thanks to our Constitution, Right to Protest Win, Farmers Win",
So farmers of just 2 states Punjab and Haryana (who are the top two richest farmers creed in whole 28 states of India) rest 26 are not protesting govt wants to reform the whole system because it's old and doesn't work for everyone alike and govt also wants to tax rich farmers which is a good move as,

farmers will never find a solution for their problems.,
Victory for the farmers.,
Save farmers save the future...,
That's why punjab government is protesting in the name for farmers ,
If any farmer need to sold his things to private companies direct then we do not need this bill anyone can do this. ,
"However, if someone thinks that problem is solved, then he is foolish. Agriculture in Punjab and Haryana is highly unsustainable and due to gradual reforms in other parts of India will automatically make farming in these 2 states less profitable and more vulnerable.",

According to my knowledge similar concept is present in US where farmers can sell there production to any one. But it failed because business men are naturally profit makers. And the reason farmers are surviving there is the incentive they get from the government to continue agriculture. As you know,
3. Logistics airport and rail facilty must be created in pan india. Farmers can give their produce to this logistics airport and railway. Initially they will face some problems but they can.

Whole summary will be - There is nothing to protest but protests happened to make ruling party to come on it's knees by letting it into vulnerabilities of victim fiasco with having preconceieved notion of ruling government being fascist but which is absolutely not but in reality it is most pussy foo,
There is half truth.  Why Not all farmers from other parts of country are  protesting. Because there is agenda of khalisthan for punjab people.,

And we can't understand the problems of farmers by reading some pages of marketing and advertising subject. They are well aware about it and that's why they are protesting,

"Thank you Dhruv...!! I was reading newspaper and about Farmers Ordinance, thought i would have to search on Youtube to understand this topic/Issue, then you uploaded the video.. Makes my work easy.. UPSC Aspirant here..",
Won't MSP lead to excess produce? Farmers can produce how much ever quantity they want and govt will be forced to buy them? Shouldnt the market decide the price instead?,
Why there is no farmer's strike in other states ? Why it is confined to vicinity of New Delhi only ? When center has assured Supreme Court that this law will be kept in abeyance for two years  - then why this strike ?,
Our Guru Nanakji was born and took his last breathe in now Pakistan....so Khalistan should be in Pakistan and as seen Pakistan is so happy to support....so it would be easy to change Pakistan's name as Khalistan.....let start this campaign...that Pakistan is Khalistan...,

Agar small farmers gareeb hi rahna chate hai toh rahne do Or rich farmers or rich banege at the end small farmers ki crop purchase rich farmers ko karni hoti hai last year jab hamne apni crop sell ki thi toh 1200 per bag  sell hui Ab usme fertilizer ki cost nikal de toh kya bacha 20 thousands ka pro,
"Corporatization of farming has resulted in the decline of the trade. Monsanto and other companies don't care about solutions.

The farm laws were good why did u repeal it Sir ,
I support farm laws. Shame on such opposition for insisting fear and violent situation. They haven't read those laws and unnecessarily insisting such activities. I want these laws be implemented ASAP.,

Bad: you failed to give any solid comment against the bills. Instead you just gave your opinion.,

2. Government had rounds of talk even suggested to postponed for 1.5 years so that protesting farmers delegations too include to rectify farm law.

"4) The new bills are placing farmers and traders at the mercy of civil servants, rather than of the courts but after protest govt agreed that all conflict will be solved in civil court by a judge now.",
"I wonder if the farmers have considered making a national union so they can all agree on minimum prices that theyll sell to markets, its possible that companies could try and buy crops from other countries but I reckon theyd eventually cave due to transportation costs",
A serious wrong decision...but modi has to do it for elections,
600 million number is misleading... it is the population directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture... not the number of farmers.,
Save india from the Kisan union and Tikait.,

Kahan Gaye voh log Jo bolte they India mein democracy nahi hai. Modi ne yeh proof Kar Diya ki voh ek democratic leader hai. Logo ke protest par laws repeal karna symbol of democracy hai. Autocratic desho mein toh aisa ho hi nahi sakta. Is decision se BJP  ke liye Meri respect badh gayi hai. ,
Now in Punjab dalit vote will not go akali dal and congress ISI khalistani motive is clear to bring AAP,
I support farmers......,
"New bill is good and it should be implemented also bill does not restrict APMC. There is a base price which Govt. Is giving if the farmer is not able to sell and base price should not be lower in contract farming also, such an agreement is void and the farmer should be compensated.",
Half knowledge is dangerous and propagating it even worse. Try to understand the reason for bringing this bill. Farmers are not allowed to sell their produce freely and they were forced to sell it in mandies even though the market price is more. And to correct you and your agricultural expert there ,
I am indian  Muslim but I love Arvind Kejriwal more than any politician,
"Sir apse kattai sahmat nhi,,how can u say that all farmers were against of it....",
I praise the Bihari man who says .... it was a wrong decision that made UP farmers sell their fields and do labour in Punjab,

"I have doubt why farmers prior to this act they  did not get MSp, with benfic of Mandis, why tomotoes and onions are thrown out side roads by the farmers, prior to this act",
Modiji is what we will know once he is gone. He feels for the nation better than any other politicians.,
#We support Farmers,
Current Farmers in protests have stopped asking for legalizing of MSP. They are no more concerned about the MSP. When asked their demands very vague and stupid answers are given by leaders and people in protests.,
We stand with our farmers,

There should have been discussions on farm laws. Farmers are not so educated to look towards research nd use of technology in their field. Govt should encourage farming families to opt for agriculture in college or school nd should invest more in research.,

My suggestion:- I don't see any private companies who working for public. The poor farmers can't bargain and sell goods at APMC(not even in MSP).

Vice needs to investigate why only farmers from Punjab and Haryana are protesting...and not the rest of India!!..,
Let's be honest about one thing - EVERYONE IS A BARGAIN HUNTER. The Middle class doesn't like to pay more and the farmers feel they are not getting enough. Most of the stuff about private companies is merely speculation and much of it cannot be totally disregarded but think of it logically - Current,
"Secondly, there is no tax on farmer, rather buyers pay the tax",
There are 3 laws passed in parliament regarding the Minimum Support Price and other farming related issue but farmers are demanding the ABOLITION those 3 laws instead of alteration in those laws,

I'm watching this video after farmers protest and my father is a policeman while my uncle is a farmer and I m ashamed to say that any of them don't know the ground reality they just criticize the bill without realising how important it is do they know that India lost millions of dollars of investmen,

Focus is more on the protests than the reforms themselves. These are much needed reforms and definitely not anti farmer. It's just misinformation being propagated by motivated groups who themselves earlier supported such reforms but now oppose them due to politics.,

Thanks BBC news....shame on modi government...I stand with farmers...jai hind,
Anyone changed his/her mind to farmers protest after watching this video?,
1) Previously there was a debate about how Minimum support price has became maximum support price as arthiyas collectively are settling a price some where near MSP and farmers are not getting enough price for their produce..APMC is full of corruption and opaqueness.,
I think the Farmers are being misguided.,
Farmers are still protesting  peacefully . Government and some people tried to fail protest on 26 jan,
What about petrol rates there is proper system for that but still different in all states ! Government is piece of shit they now want to sue poor farmer. It depends on them whoever they want to sell,
"Dairy, horticulture, animal husbandry is not under MSP and APMCs. We don't have any problem with that. Why should it be different when it comes to grains?",
Farmers are asking for govt. help which is called regulation which govt. can not provide for the sake of corporates.,
I agree that companies like Jio and Big Basket will try to give huge incentives to farmer in thier 1st stage of business model BUT why cant goverment regulate such things... i mean goverment knows that ye bade log aage jaake farmers ko exploit kr skte hein... if goverment can form a regulatory body ,

Not accepting what farmers want is totally a different story.. instead they are on verge of harming farmers. So inhuman huh ,
Its not really anti farmers but anti middleman,
Private contracts will eventually bring a competitor and farmers will have a choice to whom he wants to sell and to whom not. If you are not getting MSP in the private contract you can go for APMC's,
Ambani owns Modi like a dog. Sikh farmers are the patriots here.,
1. Why these were not taken back after 3 meetings with farmers and also arranged 13 seatings with farmers even though it was not taken back.,
"Indian govt has already taken the laws back for 18 months and has been open for negotiations, the fact is these protests/riots were never about farm laws but about Khalistani separatist movement. Govt should enforce army now",

So these so called farmers are protesting for monopoly of mandi.,
"Taking a side is very difficult in this case. Because i feel the bills are neither too right nor too wrong..... Just the timing is wrong. Before complete capitalism, complete socialism is important so that farmers can be united and their produce can be sold collectively. After complete socialisation",

"I agree with most of your videos and content but farm laws were not that exploiting in nature there were provisions for farmers appeal, land can never be ceased in the contracts. Farmers form largest voting section I don't think govt is that dumb that it would let it's DM who are point of appeal to ",
It is heinous act by government to provoke farmers to show violence while they have been protesting peacefully for almost more than 50 days. They do their best to provide food to each and everyone but their own country leaders don't listen their voice.,
"He is wrong at 8.50, even b4 the bill farmers can store (traders cannot store ). But not in my knowledge any farmer wants to play the waiting game except for giant players in farming.

These farm bills take away the farmer's right to appeal or go to a Court. That gives one idea about these farm bills.,
Now indian farmers could earn equaivalent to American farmers now ,
"And CG out of picture, The farmers will be liable to enter into contracts with the big players succumbing to their terms.",
These are rich wealthy land owners and middle men who are posing as poor farmers,
"Once the farmer is economically destroyed, the next target will be the common man (middle class). So no matter what may be we have to support the farmers.",
We should take inspiration from farmers and be prepared for 2023 polls...lets show what happens when you try do jhumla with public..,
1. How middlemen are not paying less to farmers and selling high in the market now?,
Save Farmers Save Food Save Humanity,
Do u know about Middle men Or brokers who are only getting rich from 74 years though original farmers are getting poorer & thousands of them committing suicide. These laws are there to give direct benefits to original Farmers who are basically ilitrate & Not to these so called rich & fake protestors,
They are not farmer they are Goons .,
"Hey Trevor , I am from India and the condition here is pathetic. I'm so thankful to you for taking this topic but We need more support. Please ",
"The entire argument is based on the assumption that govt is abolishing msp, which is a fake news. It's not their in the bill. So if at all this bill does anything it gives more options to the farmers, get more flexibility on top of the existing infrastructure.",
A bill should be to help farmers and remove all middlemen  one farmer to retailer or wholesaler to consumer ,
"Sorry se kaam nhi chalega modi ji... Compensate the farmers in the form of income,  increased legal MSP, more markets expansion for farming products and free health and education facilities to small & medium farmers and for the loss  they have been through since the last one year.....stop being a hy",
worst case ending: we'd be seeing documentaries about how Punjab was once this agricultural heart land of India. Greed is destroying humanity.,
MSP is being fixed by the government not by the APMC. Farmers will still enjoy MSP and APMC if they so wish. The most rewarding thing is that they would be liberated from the clutches of middle men.,
Change your headline it's not Indian farmers it's Punjab farmers,
Power of democracy at it's best...no political party or leader is above its voters...hats off to farmers...brave people,
Till Date nobody explain briefly what is benefit of Farmers from these laws and what is loss .

This is the true face of Indian Government. This is how justice is provided. Indian farmers have been protesting for a year and they're not even paying any attention to them. SHAME ON BJP. SHAME ON INDIAN DEMOCRACY ,
For Bill 2: Contract farming has been prevailing for long time in India now right. So what is the difference this bill is introducing?,

All the more the farmers create more air pollution by burning the stubble every year why dont these educated,

Even i was with the farmers till december with all my heart but when the protest gone violent we really hate the punjabi farmers,
I hope that farmers in india and pakistan both get their rights becuase they deserve it,
"But in farmer protest, BJP, RSS could not use muslim, christian, congress to suppress them. They did use anti national, khalistan, but still the farmers were hindus, so BJP had to back out, esp UP and Punjab elections.",
after listening to this whole video. I came to the conclusion that farmers lost too much.,
I m son of farmer from a village of punjab ..,
The best video I have come across regarding Farm bills. No propaganda just content and facts.    I am an engineer . I am not even preparing for IAS but love watching informational videos .You got a new student today sir .,

However in this regard, I suspect some troublemaking hooligans were paid to incite the protesters by becoming violent. I wish our leaders behaved in a more responsible manner. Ofcours",
Under this arrogant modi govt we didn't get justice for murdering  justice loya how can we expect justice in this innocent murdering of farmers.,
2. If every farmer would just grow MSP crops then any suggestions on problems that may create agricultural imbalance in the country and problems of the other non MSP crop farmers.,
"I din't get it.. there are farmers all over the country, but why the problem persists only for punjabi farmers?? please explain..",
But I have a question in my mind the question is that how a poor farmer can stay away from his/her for so long time of more than 1 and half years ? ( I ma not a supporter of modi) . And as of I think there are only about 2500 to 5000 farmers are there in protest from past few months. And is it not p,
